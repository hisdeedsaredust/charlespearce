<head type="main">The Rajah's Dinner-Party</head>

<p>It is the spring of 1851. In the Delhi plains the
mornings are close and muggy, a yellow, jaundice-
like haze hangs over the levels, the winds are hot
and dry, a foretaste of the scorching months of
May and June. The animal and vegetable worlds
show signs of the approaching season. Sheep
find little to tempt them in the dry grass, and
bleat mournfully; crows and minahs open their
beaks and gasp. Myriads of curled bundles of
vegetation are transformed in twenty-four hours
into fully expanded leaves, flowers bloom rapidly
and die as rapidly. Society ladies begin to look
pale and languid, and are too indifferent to all
things earthly to find any enjoyment in flirtation.
The one thought of every Anglo-Indian Delhi
resident is to get away to the Simla hills as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>The air in the banqueting-chamber of Dakhur
Palace, some five miles out of Simla, is warm,
<pb n="10"/>
close, and heavy with perfumes, pungent and
sweet, mingled with the scent of cheroots. The
punkahs disturb the atmosphere, but the heat
remains. The lamps throw a subdued, rosy light
on the richly decorated walls, the gorgeously
coloured rugs, the silken hangings, and on a dais
at one end of the spacious apartment sits the
sleepy-eyed, olive-tinted, fat-faced Rajah, corpu-
lent, easy-going, good-natured, popular among
the English residents and visitors of Simla and
an especial favourite of the English officers, who
are always sure of good, if risky sport, when it is
known that the Rajah is about to set out on a
hunting expedition.</p>

<p>On the day when the Rajah was entertaining his
friends, the Simla season had only just commenced,
and his highness had not been called upon to exer-
cise his hospitality on so large a scale as he might
find necessary later on. But the limited number
of the company had its advantage. There was
more room for the dancing-girls to sway and curve
their bodies, to move their small feet in circling
motion, to wave their graceful arms, and to
jingle their golden ornaments on their wrists
and ankles.</p>

<p>The Rajah had provided dancing-girls for the
amusement of his guests as a matter of course.
For centuries a dancing-girl had been indispensable
at any Indian function. She was everywhere.
It was she, to use the words of a native writer,
<q>who crowned the merriment at all times. If
it were marriage, she gave the finishing stroke
to the gaieties of the occasion. If one began to
occupy a house newly built, the ceremony of the
<pb n="11"/>
day was only brought to a conclusion when the
house rang to the noise of her anklets.</q> Native
princes had nautches at their palaces almost every
evening; the Hindus rivalled the Mahommedans
in their devotion to the dance and the dancing-
girl.</p>

<p>The military friends of the Rajah of Dakhur,
ranged to the right and left of their host, were of
every rank, from the newly-fledged, smooth-faced
sub to the fussy, self-important adjutant and the
choleric colonel. In the old John Company days
officers remained on the active list long past the
time at which they are now compelled to retire,
and in the semi-circle, in the centre of which the
dancing-girls undulated their bodies, and cast
languishing glances from velvety eyes, and crooned
a wild love-song to the monotonous scraping, the
twanging and the tum-tumming of the squatting
musicians, was more than one white-headed sep-
tuagenarian. It would not be far from the truth
to say that to these old gentlemen—most of whom
had dipped deeply into the Rajah's excellent wine
—the dancing of the Nautch girls was more attrac-
tive than it was to the young ones. Not a few of
the latter looked a little bored.</p>

<p><q>I say, Horsford,</q> whispered a youth, whose
cheeks had not quite lost the ruddiness he had
brought with him from England, <q>would it be
bad form if I slipped away? I'm getting jolly
well sick of this fun. We've had two hours of
lackadaisical turning and twisting. I'm beginning
to know what it feels like to be a teetotum. That
stuff they call music—nothing but the same
twang-twang, scrape-scrape, and tom-tom over
<pb n="12"/>
and over again—makes the business ten times
worse. If this is the Nautch dancing I've heard
so much about, I call it a beastly fraud.</q></p>

<p><q>Most things in India are either beastly or
frauds. At least, that's the conclusion our fellows
soon come to. If you've had enough of Nautch
dancing, cut it, by all means. It'll go on to past
midnight, and you're not likely to have anything
different.</q></p>

<p>Cornet Anson's eyes wandered once more to the
Nautch girls. If they would only do something
with their arms other than what seemed to him
like an attempt to swim! From his boyish point
of view there was nothing that was fascinating
in the women who smiled mechanically, and whose
betel-stained teeth almost made him shudder.
Moreover, the dancers were no longer girls. One
was thirty at least. Nor were they handsome.
As for their figures, he could not see them. Their
dresses were rich in colour and material, but they
were so numerous the lines of the body were lost.
All that could be seen were brown arms bare to
the shoulder, and bare feet and ankles, a shade
browner than the arms. The movements were
harmonious enough, but they soothed rather than
excited. Cornet Anson found himself yawning,
and an interval occurring when sweetmeats were
handed round, he disappeared to find solace in
the club billiard-room at Simla.</p>

<p>Guy Horsford was half inclined to follow young
Anson's example. He was thinking of Clare
Stanhope, to whom he had given a half promise
that some time during the evening he would call
upon her. She had said she would be in the ver-
<pb n="13"/>
andah of her uncle's bungalow as the clock struck
ten, looking out for him. He told her that the
only man she was likely to see was the man in the
moon. Both spoke lightly, but there was uncon-
scious meaning beneath their gaiety.</p>

<p>Guy Horsford looked at his watch. It was a
quarter past nine. His buggy would take him
easily to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope's bungalow on the road
to Jakoo Hill by ten. He was undecided. He
had always regarded his flirtation with Clare
Stanhope as mere sport to pass away an idle hour,
and he was pretty sure Clare looked at the matter
in the same light. This was Clare's first season
in the Hills, but she had shown herself skilful in
the chief occupation of Simla society—the art of
make-believe love-making.</p>

<p><q>You're not going, Horsford, are you?</q> said
fat, pursy, red-faced Major Ormerod at his elbow.</p>

<p><q>Why not? Where's the temptation to
stay?</q></p>

<p><q>Not very much up to the present, I admit.
These hussies aren't first chop, are they? Those
I've seen in the southern provinces beat 'em to
fits. I've been chaffing the old Rajah and telling
him he ought to import some of the Paris grisettes
to put a little life into his Cashmeer girls. What
do you think he said?</q></p>

<p><q>How the deuce should I know?</q></p>

<p><q>Why, that a little girl's going to dance to-
night who has all the Parisian vivacity. He
hinted that she has our blood in her veins.</q></p>

<p><q>English? By Jove, what an insult to us!
Ormerod, it mustn't be permitted,</q> exclaimed
Horsford angrily.</p>

<pb n="14"/>

<p><q>Don't be a fool. Lots of our fellows have
fancied native women, and some have made them
their wives.</q></p>

<p><q>That isn't the point. You know as well as I
do what most of the dancing girls really are.
Their dancing's one thing, their lives another.
Call them daughters of the horseleech, and you
have their character at once.</q></p>

<p><q>What of it? India must be taken as it is, and
not looked at with English eyes. Anyhow, if the
Rajah likes to pay this Eurasian girl to dance,
why shouldn't he? What's it got to do with us?
You don't mean to abuse his hospitality by kicking
up a row, do you? As for Eurasians, you know
as well as I do that in John Company's early days
we did nothing but snub them, and the snubbing
hasn't died out. I can't see why you should
make a fuss about a girl that no English lady in
Simla, or anywhere else in India for the matter of
that, would give house room to.</q></p>

<p>Horsford bit his lip. He knew how much truth
there was in Ormerod's words. Suddenly the
current of his thoughts was diverted by the Rajah
clapping his hands. A curtain concealing a door
was flung back with a clang of its rings, and a
young girl, charmingly perfect in the harmony of
every limb, entered, with a low salaam to the fat
Rajah and his friends. She could hardly have
been more than eleven, and her large innocent
eyes were lowered timidly beneath the bold stare
of the men.</p>

<p>Her childish beauty was strangely fascinating.
She had not the set smile of the professional
dancer; indeed, the expression of her face was
<pb n="15"/>
inclined to melancholy. Her skin was lovely—a
pale olive which crimsoned charmingly under
excitement. Nature sometimes played strange
freaks with the Eurasian. Their complexions
varied from a dusky hue, which could not be dis-
tinguished from that of the Asiatic, to that of one
born of English parents. But it was rare that the
eyes failed to show their Eastern origin. <q>East
is East, and West is West, and never the twain
shall meet,</q> sings the poet, and maybe Nature
has ordained that no product of the two shall
ever be so distinct that one or the other shall not
be evident.</p>

<p>If such a thing were possible, the beautiful child,
at the sight of whom the lobster eyes of plethoric
Colonel Chowden lost their vacuous gaze and the
sleek, impassive face of the Rajah lightened into
something like vitality, was the exception. Yet
no one who saw her quiet, graceful movements—
the movements of some beautiful feline animal—
in which every muscle and nerve played their
part, her slim, round arms, the symmetrically
moulded shoulders, her small, shapely head, and
the cast of her features, could doubt that the
strain of the East lurked within her.</p>

<p>The eyes were unmistakably of the West—an
exception to the general rule. In some lights they
were blue; in others they were grey. They were
fringed with long, dark, silky lashes, and one could
fancy they might at times flash with the fire of the
East. But that fire would come with womanhood.</p>

<p>Her dress was admirably chosen to show the
gracefulness of her lithe body. Her form was not
hidden by coloured petticoats and trousers, or by
<pb n="16"/>
the wrapping of shawls. She wore a sari—the
robe which the Hindu woman disposes so deftly
and with so much art—of pale, rose-coloured silk,
bordered with gold. Its multitudinous folds passed
over her head, the warm colour enhancing the
beauty of the dark glossy hair, and accentuating
the fairness and purity of her skin. An end of
the sari hung over one round shoulder, and the
robe itself came down just below the knee. The
delicately formed feet and ankles and the curves
above were perfect.</p>

<p>As to her ornaments and trinkets, they seemed
to be endless. Gold armlets, gold anklets, jingled
with every movement; flowers and jewels were
mingled within her hair, a perfume, sweet, pungent,
mysterious, so faint as to be little more than a
suggestion, hovered about her. She must have
been instructed, and dressed, and watched over,
by a mistress of the art of fascination and allure-
ment. Evidently she was a dancer of no common
order, for she was attended by her own musicians,
three handsome young women, one with hair that
was beginning to go grey, though she probably
had not reached her thirtieth year. This woman
played the <foreign xml:lang="hi">saringhee</foreign> or native violin, and played
it exceedingly well. She was clearly a born
musician, and with wonderful skill could vary the
strain from passionate fervour to plaintive melan-
choly, though the melody itself changed but little.</p>

<p><q>By Jove, Horsford, the Rajah's picked up a
little treasure,</q> whispered Ormerod. <q>I wonder
where she hails from, and who was her father?
Good blood, I'll swear. She has all the dignity of
a little English aristocrat, eh?</q></p>

<pb n="17"/>
<p>Horsford made no reply. It was doubtful if he
heard what Ormerod was saying. His gaze and
his thoughts were fixed on the girl. Ormerod
shrugged his shoulders. He attributed Horsford's
absorbed looks to a fascination of the senses. He
turned to Captain Martin, his neighbour on his
other side, and made some chaffing remark.</p>

<p><q>Gad, one would think Horsford was a green
griffin at his first Nautch,</q> returned Martin.
<q>He's no eyes or ears for anything but the pretty
little wench. How long has he been out here?</q></p>

<p><q>Eleven years at least. He started deuced
early. Wasn't eighteen when he carried the
colours. He was with Napier all through the
Scinde business. He got an ugly cut at Moodkee
from a <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">tegha</foreign>, that brutal, short, crooked sword the
Sikhs know how to handle so confoundedly cleverly,
and was invalided and sent to Delhi, where there
wasn't any fighting, and not likely to be any.
That was in 1845—six years ago. Delhi's not the
best place for a man with too much energy and
nothing to use it upon, eh? Satan finds some
evil work for idle hands to do—what do you say,
Martin?</q></p>

<p><q>You can answer that question for yourself,
Ormerod,</q> rejoined Captain Martin. <q>You've
had as much acquaintance with the old gentleman
as most of us.</q></p>

<p>Major Ormerod chuckled at the implied compli-
ment, and settled himself to enjoy the dancing,
for by this time he had come to the conclusion
that he was going to see somebody different from
the ordinary sleepy, mechanical <foreign xml:lang="hi">tuwaif</foreign>.</p>

<p>The girl began her dance with a gliding move-
<pb n="18"/>
ment, so slow as to be almost imperceptible. The
hands, stretched out, kept time with the feet.
The intention was allurement, temptation. There
was a mesmeric influence in every gesture. The
spectator's eye was fascinated almost to the
point of stupefaction. One saw nothing but
the swaying body, the waving, beckoning hands,
sometimes bent back until they almost touched
the curved arms—a proof not only of flexibility, but
of the accomplishments of the little dancer.</p>

<p>She sang in a sweet, timorous voice, the <foreign xml:lang="hi">saringhee</foreign>
supplying the passion the song needed for its full
expression. Now and again at certain passages,
when the wild music swelled and wailed despair-
ingly, the dancer varied the swimming, circling
motion with spasmodic starts which, by contrast
with the gliding movements, had a singularly weird
effect. Then, as the melody became ecstatic, the
whirlings increased in speed; the drapery assumed
fantastic forms, the jewels and the gold embroidery
glittered, the bangles tinkled, all was barbaric,
seductive. The imagination was inflamed, and
one was no longer in the prosaic nineteenth cen-
tury, in the year of universal peace, of the vain-
glorious great Palace of Glass in Hyde Park—
built to symbolize the triumph of commerce,
industry, and the arts over warfare and rapine—
but back in the remote days of Tamerlane, of
Genghis Khan, of the slave kings of Delhi, of
Alexander the Conqueror. Salome might have
captured the heart of Herod with such another
dance.</p>

<p>The dancer herself was transformed by the
spirit and poetry of rhythmic movement into a
<pb n="19"/>
sprite of almost unearthly beauty. The warm
blood showing beneath the glossy and transparent
skin gave a richer warmth to her complexion; the
eyes did not shine with the lustre of languorous
suggestiveness as did those of the ordinary Nautch
girl, but with intelligence, with pure and innocent
delight. The girl had no thought save enjoyment
in her wild abandonment of self. The grey orbs
expanded under the excitement, the small, full, red
lips were parted slightly, showing her white, even
teeth unstained by betel; the delicate nostrils
quivered; she had danced herself into a condition
bordering upon hysteria, and was oblivious to
everything but the mystery of music and the
dance. As she whirled faster and faster she was
unable to continue her song; she panted for
breath, her eyes became glassy in their brightness.
Then the vivid scarlet of her cheeks suddenly
died out.</p>

<p><q>My God—she's fainting. Out of the way, you
black devil!</q> was heard above the scraping of
the <foreign xml:lang="hi">saringhee</foreign>, the thrum-thrum of the <foreign xml:lang="hi">sitar</foreign>, and
the tapping of the <foreign xml:lang="hi">tom-tom</foreign>.</p>

<p>A white-robed servant was suddenly flung a
couple of yards; Guy Horsford dashed into the
arena, and caught the slender waist of the girl who,
white as a sheet, had dropped seemingly lifeless
into his arms.</p>
</div>

<head type="main">Jack Folliott's Little Girl</head>

<p>Instantly there was confusion and uproar. The
curtains parted, and the manager of the dancing
troupe, a repulsive-looking old man, slightly de-
formed, rushed to Horsford, shrieking and gesticu-
lating. If anything happened to Nara, the light of
his eyes, the pearl of his possessions, he would be
ruined! By the beard of the prophet, the maiden
was worth Heaven alone knew how many thou-
sand rupees! She was incomparable, she could
never be replaced! What had he, Hoosein Khan,
honest and always most respectable, done that
Allah had permitted so terrible a misfortune to
descend upon him? Hoosein Khan thought the
dancing-girl was dead, and from her looks he was
justified in thinking so.</p>

<p><q>Keep back, you mercenary old scoundrel,</q>
growled Horsford. <q>If you want to be of any use
fetch water. Bring it to the verandah. Quick!</q></p>

<p>He carried the girl—in his strong arms she was
no heavier than a lotus flower—out of the warm,
sickly-scented air. Ormerod and others followed.
The servants stood awaiting the Rajah's orders.
The Rajah sat immovable; quite content that
the Sahib-logue should do everything. Dancing-
<pb n="21"/>
girls belonged to a low caste. Why should he
trouble?</p>

<p>Horsford laid the girl gently on a mat. She
looked, in the silver moonrays, like a beautiful
figure of alabaster. The gold and jewels about her
glittered with a pale light, the crushed flowers in
her hair sent forth a perfume, sweet enough in the
cool air. Her <foreign xml:lang="hi">sari</foreign> had become disarranged, her
throat and the upper part of her chest were bare,
and disclosed a thin chain of gold round the base
of the neck with a locket attached. The locket
fell on her shoulder, face upwards, as Horsford
drew the <foreign xml:lang="hi">sari</foreign> round her. Almost as quickly as he
caught sight of the locket he had it in his hands.</p>

<p>For an instant he forgot the girl. The portrait
had taken him back to the fierce fight at Moodkee,
where the Sikh's <foreign xml:lang="hi">tegha</foreign> had dealt him what would
have been his death-blow but for the sabre of
his comrade, Jack Folliott, who the next minute
was shot through the heart.</p>

<p>The face in the locket reminded Horsford, too,
of something earlier than the battle of Moodkee—
of a beautiful Mahommedan girl—of a picture of
happiness—of her devotion to her lord the Sahib-
logue, the father of her child—of her passionate
grief when he took leave of her to join the expedi-
tion against the Sikhs.</p>

<p>Jack Folliott had had strange forebodings. He
could not rid himself of the idea that he was about
to fight his last fight, and if it should be so, he
begged his friend to take charge of his little child,
his Nara. Horsford gave his word, but he had
never been able to keep it. After he was brought
back to Delhi his wound stretched him on his back
<pb n="22"/>
for two months, and when he was able to move
about and make inquiries he found that the
heart-broken young mother, on hearing of the
Sahib's death, had flung herself into the Jumna,
and the child had disappeared, no one knew
whither.</p>

<p>These thoughts were mingled in a series of vivid
pictures, revived by the sight of Jack Folliott's
handsome face enshrined in the locket! There
could be no doubt about it; the dancing-girl was
Jack's daughter. As Guy Horsford gazed at the
miniature it seemed to him that dear old Jack,
the best of comrades, the most faithful of friends,
was reminding him of his solemn oath.</p>

<p>He was spirited back to actualities by the sound
of Hoosein Khan's squeaking tones. The old man
had brought a lotah filled with water, and was
holding it out with trembling, skinny hands. Guy
snatched the copper vessel and dashed its contents
in the girl's face. The long, dark eyelashes quivered,
the delicate nostrils twitched, a sigh escaped the
white lips. Then the tremulous eyelids were
slowly raised, and a vague, wistful, troubled,
timorous gaze stole from beneath. A pair of
steady, fearless blue eyes were looking into hers.
They were eyes a woman might trust—eyes that
showed the strong, unflinching nature within—eyes
that told as plainly as eyes could speak that Guy
Horsford's word was his bond.</p>

<p><q>Nara—is that your name? Do you under-
stand me?</q></p>

<p>He whispered the words in English as a test.
He called her Nara at a venture because that was
the name of Jack Folliott's little girl. A faint
<pb n="23"/>
smile curved the beautiful mouth at the sound of
his voice.</p>

<p><q>Yes, Sahib.</q></p>

<p>Every doubt was removed. She had answered
in English, her pronunciation softening the hissing
sound of the monosyllable after the fashion of the
natives of India.</p>

<p>Before Horsford could say more the old Mahom-
medan's shrill voice broke in with angry threats.
The child trembled and made an effort to rise.
Down came Horsford's hand heavily on Hoosein
Khan's arm; and he spun the man round so that
they came face to face.</p>

<p><q>See here, you dog. I've something to say
about this girl. I'm not going to talk out here,
but where you and I won't be interrupted. Mean-
while she's not going back into your care. Do
you understand that?</q></p>

<p><q>My lord—my lord—she is my own flesh and
blood. She is my own grand-daughter. She——</q></p>

<p><q>Hold your tongue. I believe you're lying.
Let us go to the Rajah.</q></p>

<p>The guests had crowded into the verandah and
looked on, puzzled and wondering. Hoosein Khan
gesticulated, jabbered, and squeaked; Horsford,
his shoulders set and square, had drawn the
frightened girl closer to him and was looking down
contemptuously at the black object grovelling at
his feet.</p>

<p><q>What mad fool's game are you up to?</q>
growled Ormerod uneasily. <q>What's the good of
kicking up a row? If you've taken a fancy to the
girl I daresay the old rascal's open to an offer.
It'll cost you a pretty penny, though. I know
<pb n="24"/>
something about Cashmeer girls, and that one'll
fetch a tip-top price.</q></p>

<p>Horsford turned from Ormerod with a gesture
of impatience. Ormerod took things as he found
them, and his coarse nature saw nothing repulsive
in slavery, for such, practically, was the condition
of dancing-girls.</p>

<p><q>What's your name?</q> said Horsford to the
Mahommedan.</p>

<p><q>Hoosein Khan, my lord—I am your lordship's
humble servant—I am but dust beneath your
lordship's feet.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course. That's understood. Come with me
to the Rajah. Don't be frightened, Nara. I'm
going to look after you now,</q> Horsford whispered
to the girl.</p>

<p>Taking her hand, he led her into the hall, Hoosein
Khan following close behind, scowling and mutter-
ing. The door at the side of the hall was ajar,
and in the opening could be seen a group of the
other dancing-girls, curiosity written in their eyes.
Among them was the tall, handsome woman who
played the <foreign xml:lang="hi">saringhee</foreign> with such expression. She
was trembling, and her face was troubled. The
curtains over a gallery at the end were drawn
slightly, and here and there could be seen a veiled
head. In this gallery were the ladies of the Rajah's
<foreign xml:lang="hi">zenana</foreign>. Unseen by the company below, they had
been witnesses of the performance, and doubtless
saw the child faint.</p>

<p>Horsford approached the stolid Rajah and
solicited the favour of an audience of his highness
in a private chamber. His request was acceded
to, and the great man, with much ceremony, and
<pb n="25"/>
accompanied by a train of officials, proceeded to
an inner room, where he seated himself on a divan,
and Hoosein Khan and the girl having prostrated
themselves before him, he listened to the case with
the utmost gravity.</p>

<p>Guy Horsford went straight to the point. The
dancing-girl, he asserted, was the daughter of his
old friend and comrade; he had bound himself in
honour to protect her, and he asked to be allowed
to take her from the life she was leading, which
could but end in one way.</p>

<p><q>There's no need to remind your highness what
that way is,</q> said Horsford. <q>I don't say there
are not dancing-girls who are not what is called
respectable, but they're difficult to find. At the
best they're exposed to horrible temptations. I
must save Nara from these. It's part of my oath.
English blood is in her veins. I stand by my
country-woman.</q></p>

<p><q>What have you to say to this, Hoosein Khan?</q>
asked the Rajah, without any comment on Hors-
ford's speech.</p>

<p><q>It does not become a worm like myself to say
aught against the Sahib. What is my word com-
pared to his? But my lord forgets that the girl—
blessed be Allah!— is of the blood of the faithful.
Her mother was a true daughter of Allah. Who
gives most to the offspring—the mother or the
father? It is the mother, highness, is it not
so?</q></p>

<p>The Rajah stroked his beard and nodded gravely.</p>

<p><q>Mashallah. And moreover I am the child's
grandfather. Am I to lose my rights—the rights
of blood and relationship?</q></p>

<pb n="26"/>
<p><q>Don't tell lies,</q> burst out Horsford angrily,
for he saw the Rajah was inclined to favour his
co-religionist. <q>Are you, with a hang-dog face,
with greed and vice written in every crease, of
royal lineage? Come—answer me.</q></p>

<p>Hoosein Khan looked terribly embarrassed. If
he made a claim to be descended from a line of
kings, and it was proved to be false, it would lay
him open to severe punishment. If dancing-girls
were looked down upon, the infamous men and
women who trafficked in them and grew rich out
of the hire and sale of the poor creatures were
despised. They were useful to voluptuaries, but
they were scorned all the same.</p>

<p><q>Why do you not reply to the Sahib?</q> asked
the Rajah, frowning. <q>What is your family?</q></p>

<p><q>Your servant does not understand the lord
Sahib,</q> he faltered. <q>Your servant's family is
most respectable. I can bring references. My
patrons speak well of me, and you yourself, High-
ness, have done so.</q></p>

<p>The Rajah cast a puzzled look at Horsford.
He did not understand the purport of the English-
man's reference to royal lineage. Horsford soon
enlightened him. Jack Folliott once told him
that Nara's mother was descended from Shah
Jahan, the great Moghul King, whose name is
indissolubly associated with Delhi. There were
papers and old jewels in existence to prove it, but
Horsford had no evidence of this beyond Folliott's
word.</p>

<p>Jack Folliott, however, swore he had seen these
things, and once, when walking with Horsford
southward from Delhi, he took his friend into a
<pb n="27"/>
little cemetery, long ago a village known as Arb-
Ke-Sarai, and showed him the grave of Princess
Jahanara, <q>the poor in spirit,</q> the beloved
daughter of Shah Jahan. The dancing-girl's
mother had given her child the name of this far-
famed lady, from one of whose brothers the mother
herself claimed to be descended. The Princess
Jahanara's mother was the celebrated Arjmand
Bānu Begam, over whose grave the bereaved hus-
band built the most magnificent monument in the
world, the far-famed Taj Mahal at Agra.</p>

<p>Horsford did not go into the details concerning
Jahanara's tomb. He confined himself to all
that related to his assertion that the girl Nara was
descended from the family of the good and virtuous
Princess.</p>

<p><q>Does not your highness see,</q> he cried indig-
nantly, <q>the shame of allowing a descendant of
the illustrious Shah Jahan to become a common
<foreign xml:lang="hi">tuwaif</foreign>, of permitting her to associate with harlots
if not becoming one herself, of compelling her to
sell her beauty to the highest bidder? Is it not
disgraceful—humiliating?</q></p>

<p><q>You speak with much reason, Sahib,</q> the
Rajah was pleased to say. <q>But is it true? Is
the girl of the line of the great kings of Delhi?</q></p>

<p><q>No—no,</q> burst in Hoosein Khan. <q>Her
mother was a <foreign xml:lang="hi">tuwaif</foreign> like herself. I can bring a
hundred witnesses to prove it.</q></p>

<p><q>Liar!</q> thundered Horsford. <q>I knew Nara's
mother. She was not a <foreign xml:lang="hi">tuwaif</foreign>, but the daughter
of a Delhi merchant, who was ruined by grasping
Mahajans (money-lenders). Since you know so
much, rascal, who was Nara's father?</q></p>

<pb n="28"/>

<p><q>How can I tell, Sahib? My daughter, Nara's
mother, had many lovers.</q></p>

<p>The words had no sooner left his lips than
Horsford's fist shot out and swiftly followed a
sullen thud and a howl. Hoosein Khan was
writhing on the floor, felled by as straight a blow
as a boxer's fist ever delivered.</p>

<p><q>I apologise to your highness for losing my
temper, but the scoundrel deserved all he got.
Let him defame his own womenkind if he likes,
but not that of this poor child,</q> cried Horsford
hotly.</p>

<p><q>It is of no consequence,</q> said the Rajah
suavely. <q>I regret the Sahib has given himself
the trouble of thrashing the wretch. Hassan</q>—
he turned to one of his attendants—<q>remove
that man. See that he does not escape. I will
consider his punishment.</q></p>

<p>At these words Hoosein Khan, who was still
grovelling, sprang to his feet and begged by all that
was holy not to be separated from his grand-child.
The Rajah took no notice of his appeals, and
Hassan and two others were advancing towards
the old man when the latter sprang forward, and
coming within a couple of paces of the Rajah,
began talking rapidly in a low voice. Horsford
could not hear what was said, but he saw the
Rajah's flabby face change. Then Hoosein sud-
denly stopped and watched the effect of his words.</p>

<p><q>This man has given me good reasons to show
that he did not intend to insult the Sahib,</q> said
the Rajah after a pause to Horsford. <q>He desires
to apologise to the Sahib.</q></p>

<p><q>The Sahib doesn't care a hang about his
<pb n="29"/>
intentions,</q> rejoined Horsford shortly. <q>His
reasons are different. May I ask your Highness
what they were?</q></p>

<p><q>Very trifling,</q> said the Rajah hastily. <q>They
are not worthy the Sahib's benign consideration.</q></p>

<p><q>For all that the Sahib would like to hear them,</q>
muttered Horsford to himself. <q>There's some-
thing here I don't like, but it's no good rowing the
Rajah. He's not a bad sort, but I reckon he'll
stick to his race. I shall get nothing out of him,
but that doesn't matter so long as I save Jack
Folliott's little girl.</q></p>

<p><q>I hope,</q> said he aloud, <q>that your highness
has decided that I may take possession of my
countryman's daughter.</q></p>

<p><q>I cannot give you my decision now. I must
think. It is a matter of grave importance. I must
consult others. But be not disturbed. The child
will be quite safe. She shall not go back to
Hoosein Khan, but shall be kept within the Palace
under keeping of my own guards.</q></p>

<p><q>And when will your highness deign to pro-
nounce your decision? To-morrow?</q> said Hors-
ford, in a tone of disgust which he did not attempt
to disguise.</p>

<p><q>Too soon, Sahib. There is no need for hurry.
The girl is safe—quite safe.</q></p>

<p>And for the moment Guy Horsford had to be
satisfied. But when his glance fell on the girl and
saw her piteous, helpless expression and her big
eyes fixed on him, had prudence not restrained
him he would have caught her up in his arms and
borne her away, despite the Rajah and his guards.</p>

<p>But such an act might have had far-reaching
<pb n="30"/>
consequences although India was at that time in
tranquillity—as Indian tranquillity went. There
had been no war since the Sikhs surrendered in
1849, no uneasiness from the time when Sir Charles
Napier disbanded the 66th Native Infantry the
year after for mutinous conduct in refusing to
take part in the Burmese war then impending;
all the nations of the world were preaching peace,
and envoys from the four quarters of the globe
were journeying to Hyde Park to demonstrate by
their presence in the glass building of industry
that cutting throats and pistollings were out of
fashion and that martial glory was a thing of the
past.</p>

<p><q>Craft must be met by craft,</q> thought Horsford.
<q>I'll keep my promise to Jack, come what may.
<choice><reg>Good-bye</reg><orig>Goodbye</orig></choice>, little one—for the present,</q> said he in
a low voice.</p>

<p>The girl meanwhile had been standing motion-
less as a statue, her arms hanging limply by her
sides, her eyes alternately watching Guy Horsford
and the Rajah. Her remembrance of her father's
tongue was probably very hazy, and it was hardly
likely that she understood all that was going on,
but that she realised its purport was certain, for
when Horsford bade her good-bye her face became
inexpressibly sad, and she raised her arms im-
pulsively as though she would have embraced him.</p>

<p><q>You will not leave me,</q> she whispered plain-
tively in Hindustani.</p>

<p><q>I swear I won't. I shall come for you wherever
you may be. Keep a brave heart. You are not
going with Hoosein Khan.</q></p>

<p><q>But when shall I see the Sahib? Nara will
<pb n="31"/>
be wretched while he is away. He is the light of
her eyes,</q> she whispered anxiously.</p>

<p><q>Look for me to-morrow—or the next day at
farthest.</q></p>

<p>They could talk no longer. Hassan had called
to one of the female servants of the <foreign xml:lang="hi">zenana</foreign>,
a tall, strapping, Rajput woman, who evidently
understood why she had been summoned. She
was to act as guardian, or perhaps gaoler, of the
dancing-girl, whom she looked upon with the
greatest contempt, because of Nara's profession.</p>

<p><q>Go, thou daughter of wickedness—through
yonder door,</q> said she harshly, pointing with com-
manding gesture to the end of the room.</p>

<p>Nara obeyed with a meekness and resignation
which seemed to tell Guy Horsford that the childish
spirit within her was crushed. He ground his
teeth to think that Jack Folliott's daughter should
be subjected to such humiliation, treated like a
slave and held in contempt even by menials. But
for the moment he could do nothing.</p>

<p>Unless Horsford was prepared to act, to show
resentment would do more harm than good. He
must bow to Indian customs and etiquette, and
with elaborate compliments to the Rajah, and
expressing his entire faith in the wisdom and in
the supreme sense of justice of his highness, he
strode from the room.</p>

<p>One of the Rajah's numerous retinue conducted
Horsford from the audience chamber, and led him
through a network of passages into a wide entrance
hall, where a host of servants were in attendance.
Whether there was any motive in this Horsford
did not trouble; he was too glad not to encounter
<pb n="32"/>
his friends and be pestered with questions. His
<foreign xml:lang="hi">syce</foreign> was among the servants in the hall, and he
sent the man for his buggy.</p>

<p>Within the next ten minutes he was speeding
down the steep road skirting the Elysium Hill and
leading to Simla, high walls of black on either side
looking solid as rock at night but in the daytime
resolving themselves into forests of deodar. The
metallic sound of his horse's hoofs set up in his
brain cells a jingle of monotonous strains—a sort
of drone base to the weird, plaintive melody of the
<foreign xml:lang="hi">saringhee</foreign> which still lingered in his memory. The
picture of the child whirling to the music, the
glittering gold, the sparkling jewels, the undula-
tions of her supple body, her appealing eyes; the
story of her descent from the far-off Shah Jahan—
it was all fantastic, unreal, mystic; romance
instinct with the wild traditions of ancient India.
The past confronted the present. The East and
the West had united for a brief space. In love or
in hate? Who could say?</p>

</div>

<pb n="33"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="3">III</num></head>
<head type="main">The World Forgetting, by the World Forgot</head>

<p>The buggy entered the Mall, the principal thor-
oughfare in Simla. It was a quarter past ten.
Brilliant pencils of light shot from the slits of the
shutters and tatties of the bungalows; a polka,
thumped on a piano very much out of tune,
mingled with women's laughter and the deeper
tones of men. Buggies and <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dhoolies</foreign>, with here and
there a clumsy country cart from the hills drawn
by oxen, and an occasional horseman, made up
the traffic in the centre of the road. Groups of
natives were staring vaguely, or grunting and
gesticulating according to their mood. Simla was
in full wakefulness after slumbering through the
heat of the day.</p>

<p>The buggy slackened its pace—due more to the
inclination of the horse than to any intention on
the part of its master—on approaching a bungalow
standing some distance from the road and half
hidden by great clumps of rhododendron.</p>

<p><q>I guess Clare will be expecting me,</q> thought
Horsford. <q>Shall I call? My only other place of
refuge is the club. I'm not in the mood to be
bored by Deputy Commissioner Dobson's prosy
tales, or that young fool Blackley's inane chatter—
<pb n="34"/>
they generally take possession of the smoking-room
at this time.</q></p>

<p>There was whist and vingt-et-un, of course, but
he was not inclined for those either. A chat with
Clare, if she were alone, would be pleasant. He
would like to tell her of his adventure of that
night. If he succeeded in rescuing Nara from her
vile associations he would need a woman's help
and counsel as to the future of the girl. He
wondered if he could talk freely to Clare on
the subject. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope, Clare's uncle, was
broad-minded enough, but a young lady who had
been in India scarcely six months might have
narrow ideas on the subject of Eurasians and
Nautch girls.</p>

<p>But the point was, should he call? The horse
settled the matter. Horsford was driving with a
loose rein and the animal stopped of its own accord,
a sign that it had taken the buggy to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stan-
hope's bungalow pretty regularly. Horsford threw
the reins to the <foreign xml:lang="hi">syce</foreign>, jumped out, and entered the
compound. As he threaded his way round the
thickets voices struck upon his ear.</p>

<p><q>I'm not a man to take <q>no</q> for an answer, Miss
Stanhope,</q> some one was saying. The voice, hard,
almost rasping, was that of Andrew Meldrum, one
of the richest merchants in India. He dealt in
everything—indigo, cotton, rice, shawls, muslins,
and half a hundred other commodities. He had
branches in Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, and Delhi.</p>

<p>Then followed a musical little laugh. Horsford
knew this also. The laugh was not so mellow and
spontaneous as it usually was.</p>

<p>A tall, square-shouldered man was in the act of
<pb n="35"/>
raising his straw hat to a girl in white muslin
standing within the verandah.</p>

<p><q><foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir</foreign>,</q> said he, and the harsh voice
softened.</p>

<p><q>Good-night, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum,</q> called out the girl
gaily. <q>Beware of the <foreign xml:lang="hi">goojurs</foreign> (robbers). I'm
told they've been seen on the Meerut road.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I'm always prepared for gentry of that
kind, whether <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">goojurs</foreign> or Delhi <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign> (roughs).</q></p>

<p>As he turned Horsford's step was heard on the
hard sand.</p>

<p><q>Good evening, Captain Horsford,</q> said he a
little stiffly.</p>

<p><q>Oh, good evening. How are you?</q></p>

<p>Not another word was said. Meldrum with his
grim, hatchet face, and yellow, dried complexion,
which made his five and fifty years appear almost
three score and ten, went on towards the road.
He looked back before he passed the thicket, and
paused for an instant, his cold, flinty eyes gleaming
beneath his straight, grey brows. Until that
moment he could not say he had been jealous of
Guy Horsford, but much had happened during the
last two hours. Andrew Meldrum, who had been
proof against the blandishments and simperings
of maidens and widows, had proposed marriage to
Clare Stanhope! She had not accepted him, but
she had not said no. This uncertainty did not
surprise the merchant. He expected something
of the kind, and it made no difference in his re-
solve. He was not one to be easily turned from
anything upon which he had set his mind.</p>

<p><q>The doctor is out, Captain Horsford,</q> he heard
Clare say in her clear, penetrating tones.</p>

<pb n="36"/>
<p>The words relieved Meldrum's fears. Guy Hors-
ford had not called to see Clare—that was some-
thing. Nor did Clare appear eager to ask the
officer in. She remained standing near a slender
support of the bungalow, a graceful, dainty little
figure, and Horsford had stopped quite a couple of
yards from her.</p>

<p>Crushing the doubts that had leaped up and set
his nerves quivering for an instant, Andrew Mel-
drum strode on, with his somewhat ungainly,
bow-legged step. Until the last five years he had
for nearly a quarter of a century passed sixteen
hours every day, during the indigo season, in the
saddle, riding about his fields, looking after the
crops, and seeing that the ryots and the overseers
stuck to their work. His industry had had its
reward in the vast fortune he had amassed, but
this was all that could be said about it.</p>

<p><q>The doctor is out,</q> repeated Horsford. <q>And
what of that? I didn't promise to call on him.</q></p>

<p><q>You didn't promise to call on any one. Or,
if you did, you're very unpunctual. Do you know
it's half past ten?</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly. Aren't you glad to see me?</q></p>

<p>They were like two masters of fence making
the salute before engaging. It was all done
laughingly, and with ease and grace, according
to the rules.</p>

<p><q>Glad? I don't know. That all depends upon
yourself.</q></p>

<p>The girl threw up her chin with an air of sauci-
ness quite in keeping with her piquant beauty.
The perfect contour of the small, scarlet, upper lip
was presented defiantly, as if daring him to kiss
<pb n="37"/>
it. He was not to be provoked. Perhaps he
meant to provoke <emph>her</emph>.</p>

<p><q>I warn you I'm not in a mood to be what you
call nice,</q> said he.</p>

<p><q>No? I'd like to see you out of temper,
Captain Horsford—just once. I wonder if I could
really send you into a passion.</q></p>

<p><q>I'll quote your own words—I don't know; it
all depends upon yourself.</q></p>

<p>Horsford did not attempt to approach her.
He stood straight and erect, waiting for the invita-
tion to enter. He knew it would come.</p>

<p><q>Why do you stand there?</q> she asked with
sudden petulance. <q>Why don't you come in?
You're not afraid, are you?</q></p>

<p><q>Afraid? Of you, Clare? Again—I don't
know.</q></p>

<p>He came close to her. She raised her head, not
saucily as before, but with a suggestion of entreaty
as a naughty child fears punishment. Horsford
was tall, just under six feet; Clare was five feet
three; he had to bend to meet her eyes. The
soft, rippling hair, chestnut, with a shade of gold
in certain lights, was arranged with the neatness
which is one of the weapons a little woman skilfully
wields to subjugate man. Big women, somehow,
are either not so dependent on neatness, or do not
see its importance.</p>

<p>Clare might have been a Dresden china shepher-
dess in her daintiness; in the harmonious lines of
her shoulders, in her round, full—not too full—
throat, in the delicately shaped bust. The sweep
of the chin to the ear was exquisite, and so also
were the curves of the chin itself, and the dimple
<pb n="38"/>
which sprang into life on the right cheek whenever
she smiled. Her complexion was pure white and
pink; how long it would remain so in the dry air
and scorching heat of India was doubtful. But
just now she was at her best and freshest.</p>

<p>So they remained for a brief space looking eye
into eye. Horsford had never seen Clare in what
might be called a serious mood. She was all
surface, so he had often thought, and he had never
attempted to fathom the depth of her nature.
She was always gay and sparkling, but there was
meaning, and often wit, mingled with her frivolity,
and her great charm was that she never varied.
She had always a bright smile, always seemed to
be in high spirits, and men were made to feel in
some subtle way that she desired to please them.
But she always kept a level head. Scores of her
admirers would have given anything if she had
permitted them to lay their hearts at her feet.
Flirtation somehow protected her. Directly any
would-be Don Juan began to sentimentalise she
laughed, and before her raillery the lady-killer
was powerless. Perhaps this was why she and
Horsford were such good friends. Guy Horsford
scorned—or pretended to scorn—love and senti-
ment as much as she did.</p>

<p>It might have been the effect of the mellow
moonlight, mingled with the ruddy glare of a
crimson shaded lamp in the prettily furnished
drawing-room, the long, French windows of which
were open, but to Horsford's fancy the hazel eyes
seemed shot with orange tinted gleams which
made them strangely fascinating, strangely
mystical. He hardly knew if he liked or disliked
<pb n="39"/>
her eyes under this new aspect, but he was not in
tune just then for a deliberate analysis of a woman's
nature by the light of its outward manifestations,
and least of all of Clare's nature. Nor was he in
the mind for anything deliberate. His impulses,
set going by the romantic episode in the Rajah's
palace, were in rebellion, and their tumult had
been increased by the <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</foreign> with Andrew
Meldrum. It was puzzling that the unimportant
fact of the merchant's visit to Clare Stanhope
should make any difference in his feelings towards
her, but so it was.</p>

<p><q>I'm going to accept your invitation, Clare,</q>
said he, abruptly, breaking a silence which had
become embarrassing to both. <q>Just to show
I'm not afraid, you know.</q></p>

<p>The words were intended to be uttered jestingly,
but the tone was soft and tender, much more so
than Horsford suspected. Clare made no reply,
but wheeled round swiftly and crossed the veran-
dah, Horsford following close behind. They en-
tered together through the open French window,
and Clare, turning, closed the inside shutters.</p>

<p><q>Look at the lamp,</q> she cried. <q>Why are
those silly winged things so anxious to commit
suicide?</q></p>

<p><q>I expect they find it pleasant to die for love
of the object that lures them to their destruction,</q>
rejoined Horsford, shrugging his shoulders.
<q>Many a man has done the same thing.</q></p>

<p>A little high-pitched, almost hysterical, laugh
was Clare's reply. A note in the laugh reminded
Horsford of past experience. Such a laugh he had
once called <q>wicked.</q></p>

<pb n="40"/>
<p>The duel continued. The etiquette of the
salute had been complied with, but neither com-
batant was eager to come to close quarters. Hors-
ford walked about the room restlessly. Clare
fidgeted with the flowers in the vases, moved the
music on the piano, arranged the tiresome anti-
macassars, without which, at that date, no room
was considered furnished. The exalted strain felt
by both when they were looking into each other's
eyes had relaxed. It needed fresh stimulus to
bring it back to its former high pitch.</p>

<p><q>I'm so sorry I was late,</q> said Horsford, apropos
of nothing. <q>The fact is I had an adventure at
the Rajah's and—— But perhaps I should have
been in the way had I come earlier.</q></p>

<p><q>Why? I don't understand you.</q></p>

<p><q>I might have interrupted your <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</foreign> with
Meldrum.</q></p>

<p>Their swords had crossed at last. Horsford's
thrust was swiftly parried.</p>

<p><q>I wish you had. I gave you every chance. I
knew he would be here at half past nine. He sent
me a note to that effect this morning. That was
why I asked you to come.</q></p>

<p>Clare's colour heightened. The scarlet of her
cheeks was dazzling. The sudden sharpening of
her voice and the way she flung her words at
Horsford betrayed the strain on her nerves.</p>

<p><q>I see,</q> rejoined Horsford, savagely reckless.
<q>Why didn't you tell me how useful I might have
made myself, and I would have made it a point
to be punctual.</q></p>

<p><q>It doesn't matter. Why should it? As for
telling you beforehand that I expected <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
<pb n="41"/>
Meldrum, and that I wanted you to—to—— Oh,
how stupid men are!</q></p>

<p><q>Possibly because they can't see into a woman's
mind, and guess her motive before she knows it
herself. It seems to me that everything a woman
does, she does without thinking, and she finds
out her reasons afterwards.</q></p>

<p><q>Guy, sometimes I positively hate you.</q></p>

<p>There was a little catch in her voice that went
straight to his heart. Guy Horsford could on
occasion be as foolish as any man where a woman
was concerned. The next moment he had capitu-
lated; he was by her side, his arm round her
waist, anxious to be friends again. Yet it could
hardly be said that they had quarrelled.</p>

<p><q>I'm awfully sorry if I've said anything to hurt
you,</q> he pleaded penitently. <q>Do forgive me.</q></p>

<p><q>What is there to forgive? You've a perfect
right to your opinion. I'm nothing to you.</q></p>

<p><q>Nothing? How do you know that?</q> Hors-
ford cried quickly.</p>

<p>Her head was averted. At his words she in-
voluntarily turned her face towards him. Her
eyes no longer sparkled, but shone with a soft,
subdued light, and then the lids drooped as if she
feared her gaze had betrayed some secret. He was
dimly conscious that she was closer, whether
from any action on his part or hers it was hard
to say. But it did not matter. The purple
mist of passion enveloped both without a moment's
warning. Some strange power within them had
annihilated space, time, and everything but their
two selves. They were the sole inhabitants of
their self-created world.</p>

<pb n="42"/>
<p><q>Don't—don't! You frighten—me,</q> panted
the girl. He had kissed her with sudden
fierceness.</p>

<p>She seemed but a doll in his arms. He felt
that it would be a positive pleasure to crush the
symmetrical little form. He lifted her from her
feet and held her half a dozen inches from the
ground while he kissed her again and again. She
struggled, but she was helpless.</p>

<p><q>It isn't fair,</q> she cried. <q>You're cruel—
horribly cruel. Put me down. I insist upon it.</q></p>

<p>He obeyed slowly and reluctantly. She sank
gasping on a settee; he dropped into the vacant
space by her side. The days of flirtation were
over—both felt that. They had sounded a new
note in the never dying gamut of love. What
would be the end of it?</p>

<p>The glamour, the delirium of passion passed. The
world of reality asserted its domination relentlessly.
The faint, sickly scent of the flowers, the hot, close
air, the buzz of self-immolating winged life, the
monotonous tick of the French clock—all was
accentuated.</p>

<p>Horsford flung open the window. He stood for
some few minutes inhaling the cool, fresh air from
the mountains. It was hard to say what definite
thought, if he had any thought at all, was in his
mind. Perhaps, could his feelings have been
analysed, those of the gambler who unexpectedly
had been tempted to stake his all approached the
nearest. Had he won or lost? That was the
problem he could not solve. He started. The
pressure of soft fingers on his arms set his nerves
thrilling once more.</p>

<pb n="43"/>
<p><q>What are you thinking about?</q> Clare whis-
pered.</p>

<p>She had stolen to him so gently and he was so
absorbed he had not heard the rustle of her
flounced muslin. She insinuated her left hand
under his arm and with the right hand above
intertwined her fingers as though to signify that
she had captured him and henceforth he was
her prisoner. The conviction that the woman
after all was the conqueror caused a sudden revul-
sion of feeling.</p>

<p><q>Did Meldrum ask you to-night to be his wife?</q>
he broke out abruptly.</p>

<p><q>Why do you talk of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum—now?</q>
she asked with piquant petulance. <q>Tell me
about yourself, Guy, and what you and the rest
did at the Rajah's dinner? You spoke about an
adventure. What was it?</q></p>

<p><q>You shall know presently. First give me an
answer to my question about Meldrum.</q></p>

<p><q>How tiresome you are,</q> she cried, with a
little <foreign xml:lang="fr">moue</foreign>. <q>Can't you see that there's only
one man in the world who interests me, and that's
Guy Horsford?</q></p>

<p>Her power over him was evident. His manner
softened. He kissed her eyelids and said laughingly:</p>

<p><q>Of course. That goes without saying. But
I don't want to be in the dark about Meldrum. I'd
like to know how to meet him.</q></p>

<p><q>Well then—he <emph>did</emph> put the question to me.
But what of it?</q> she rejoined, her clasped
fingers tightening their pressure on his arm.
<q>Do you suppose, you silly boy, I haven't had
offers of marriage?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't doubt it, but—your answer to this
particular one?</q></p>

<p><q>I believe you're going to be cross,</q> she cried,
dropping her head on his shoulder coaxingly.
<q>You mustn't. Nobody's ever cross with me.</q></p>

<p><q>Why should they be? But I've a right to
know about Meldrum. Come, tell me.</q></p>

<p>A note of masterfulness crept into his voice.
Clare gave a little shiver. She did not like Hors-
ford's persistency. It annoyed her, but she did
not intend to show her annoyance. She was
very desirous of pleasing the man whose kisses
were fresh on her lips—more desirous than ever—
but her way of pleasing was by avoiding all sub-
jects that were unpleasant, and just now the name
of Andrew Meldrum was particularly objection-
able. She would have wriggled out of answering
Guy's question, but she felt there was no way.</p>

<p><q>I didn't say either yes or no.</q></p>

<p>Horsford's brows contracted slightly.</p>

<p><q>That's a pity. Meldrum will be sure to assume
you meant yes.</q></p>

<p><q>Nonsense. I didn't encourage him even to
think it.</q></p>

<p><q><emph>You're</emph> talking nonsense now. I know that if
a woman gave me such an answer I should under-
stand what she meant. And so, I bet, will Mel-
drum. I hate the man, but I can't deny that he
has the quality of not knowing when he's beaten.
You must write and say with firmness and de-
cision——</q></p>

<p><q>My dear boy, I don't know what firmness and
decision mean. And I do so hate writing unpleasant
letters. I'm sure to be most aggravating.</q></p>

<pb n="45"/>
<p><q>I dare say. That can't be helped. It's very
evident that if you don't write and settle the
matter he'll be continually pestering you, and I
won't have it—you're mine, Clare—yes,</q> he re-
peated, something of his old fierceness creeping
into his voice, <q>you're mine—mine!</q></p>

<p><q>As if I should ever forget <emph>that!</emph></q> she cried,
her eyes suddenly blazing. She was silent for a
few seconds and then gave a little sigh. <q>I
believe you're going to be a dreadful tyrant, like
some of those terrible old Moghul Delhi kings. I
suppose you must be obeyed. Yes, I'll write to
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum. And now please be nice, and tell
me about your adventure.</q></p>

<p>The French clock struck the hour of midnight.
Its sharp, imperative clang jarred upon both.</p>

<p><q>The doctor said he would return soon after
twelve,</q> she whispered. <q>No, don't shut the
window. The room's fearfully hot. Let us sit
down comfortably. Stay—you'll have a <q>peg,</q>
won't you? How dreadfully inhospitable of me
not to think of it before. You poor fellow!</q></p>

<p>Clare flitted to a sideboard and returned with a
liqueur glass of brandy. They resumed their
seats on the settee and Horsford slowly sipped
the spirit.</p>

<head type="main">The Little Rift</head>

<p>Guy Horsford told Clare everything. The story
of Jack Folliott, his bravery, his devotion to his
comrade and friend, his death, was new to her.
Her talks hitherto with Horsford had never risen
above the frothy frivolity of flirtation. The
earnestness, the depth of feeling he now showed
when reviving tragic memories were revelations
of character which came upon her with a sense of
novelty. Her own life had been passed amid easy
and pleasant surroundings. She had never had
a care. She had always been petted by her
relatives; at first because she had been left mother-
less when very young, and afterwards because she
soon discovered that demonstrations of affection,
tempered by discretion, and an avoidance of
treading on people's sensitive corns, resulted in
advantages for herself. After she left school she
passed her time in staying first with one rich
relation and then with another, making herself
agreeable, and acquiring, unconsciously perhaps,
a considerable knowledge of the weaknesses of
human nature.</p>

<p>The first part of Horsford's narrative thrilled
her. It lifted her into a higher world—a world
<pb n="47"/>
of which previously she had had no knowledge
except in the cold pages of historic books at
school—secretly voted <q>frightfully dry.</q> To hear
an account of a battle, of heroism, of death, from
the lips of a soldier was a different matter.</p>

<p><q>Oh, how brave you are,</q> she cried with glist-
ening eyes. <q>Fancy my knowing you all this
time and never suspecting what my poor dear boy
had gone through. But the adventure in the
Rajah's Palace &#x2026;?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm coming to that now. I had to tell you
first about Jack Folliott. It forms a sort of pro-
logue, as you'll see.</q></p>

<p>He plunged into the recital. As he went on he
almost forgot the pretty, dainty plaything by his
side; he did not even notice she had withdrawn
a few inches from him. He thought only of his
oath to his dying friend, of the pathetic picture
of the child, of her helplessness, of her terrible
future if she were not rescued.</p>

<p><q>That's the story so far as it's gone,</q> said he
in conclusion. <q>It's to be continued in our next
—but in what way nobody knows. In any case
I'm not going to let the matter rest. I must keep
my promise. I should never forgive myself if I
did not. Don't you think, Clare, I'm right?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, quite right,</q> she echoed. <q>What sort of
looking girl is this interesting <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">protégée</foreign> of yours?
Sallow and listless like all half castes?</q></p>

<p><q>Not in the least. If she were dressed in muslin
and flounces and her hair done up like yours, I
believe you'd hardly think she wasn't entirely
English. As for her looks, I never saw a more
lovely child.</q></p>

<pb n="48"/>
<p><q>Most romantic! You call her a child—how
old is she?</q></p>

<p><q>About eleven, I should think.</q></p>

<p><q>Eleven! Why, Indian girls become wives at
that age.</q></p>

<p>Horsford was not unconscious of the slightly
sarcastic note in Clare's voice. It was not en-
couraging for any hope of assistance from her, but
he went on nevertheless.</p>

<p><q>I'm quite aware of that,</q> he retorted. <q>But
I don't see what it has to do with the infamy of
the thing. Look here, dearest, I'm going to
appeal to you as an Englishwoman.</q></p>

<p><q>I'd rather you didn't,</q> Clare interrupted
quickly. <q>I hate appeals. They always mean
you're asked to do something you don't care a
bit about.</q></p>

<p><q>Wait a moment. You're not asked for any-
thing more than shelter for this poor waif and
stray until I can decide what's the best to be done.
If the Rajah refuses to give her up, I shall take
her by stratagem or—force. She may have to be
concealed. I strongly suspect there's a plot going
on between the Rajah and Hoosein Khan, but if
there's a thousand plots I'll defeat them. You'll
help me, won't you?</q></p>

<p><q>Was your friend Captain Folliott married to
the girl's mother?</q> asked Clare after a pause.</p>

<p><q>I don't know and I don't care. What does it
matter?</q></p>

<p><q>It matters a good deal. The Rajah's a great
friend of uncle's, and one of his best patients. I'm
quite sure the doctor wouldn't care to quarrel with
the Rajah on account of a worthless dancing-girl.</q></p>

<pb n="49"/>
<p><q>Worthless? How?</q></p>

<p><q>Haven't you said just now that you don't
know whether her mother and father were married.
From what I've heard of the old days most likely
they weren't.</q></p>

<p><q>And that's your objection?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, isn't it a proper one? I'm certain all
the English ladies in Simla and Delhi—Delhi
especially—would say I was right.</q></p>

<p><q>No doubt—no doubt,</q> returned Horsford, with
a hard laugh.</p>

<p>He rose from the settee and paced the room,
his eyes averted from the girl who but a short
half hour ago seemed all in all to him. He was
bitterly disappointed, not so much at Clare's
refusal, perhaps, as at her line of argument. He
thought she had more generosity, that she was not
governed by narrow English prejudices. It never
occurred to him that she could be jealous of a
mere child!</p>

<p>Horsford thought he understood Clare's char-
acter. He was never within the fringe of it. He
little suspected that the little Dresden china figure,
looking so fair and fragile, was anything but weak-
minded, anything but vacillating, and could be as
stubborn as a mule when it suited her. Clare
Stanhope always knew exactly what she wanted,
and generally managed to get it. Her passion for
Horsford, one might say, was an act of folly, for
Clare was bent upon marrying a rich man, and
Horsford was over head and ears in debt. The
contradiction is hard to explain, save that the
clearest-headed and most determined may have
lapses. Who could say what a woman of this type
<pb n="50"/>
might not do? If she were so minded she would
go to extremes either in prudence or folly.</p>

<p>Horsford ceased his pacing. He stopped in
front of her. Clare was sitting quite composedly,
her clasped hands resting lightly on her crossed
knees. She looked remarkably cool and indifferent
—an effect due perhaps to the absence of her
usually brilliant colour. She had gone somewhat
pale, and the swinging of the little foot was an
indication of disturbed nerves.</p>

<p><q>I won't worry you any more, Clare,</q> said
Horsford slowly. <q>I'm sorry I mentioned the
business. I ought to have known you could hardly
mix yourself up in such a matter.</q></p>

<p><q>And what do you intend to do?</q></p>

<p><q>Go on with it, of course—to the bitter end.</q></p>

<p>Clare sprang to her feet, trembling violently.
She came close to Horsford and raised her hands
swiftly to his shoulders.</p>

<p><q>Have you thought of the consequences?</q> she
whispered in a low, tremulous voice.</p>

<p><q>No. I'm not sure what they'll be. I shall
risk them in any case.</q></p>

<p><q>So in spite of &#x2026; of everything, you intend
to give me up.</q></p>

<p>Horsford opened his eyes in amazement.</p>

<p><q>Good Heavens, no. Why should I? Do you
take me for a cad—a coward?</q></p>

<p><q>No, but I think you must imagine I'm a fool.
What will people say about you? That you are
the associate of dancing-girls. Among men such
a reputation doesn't matter, but among women—
English women——</q></p>

<p><q>Well, whatever is said,</q> interrupted Horsford
<pb n="51"/>
hotly, <q>you, who know the truth, can defend
me.</q></p>

<p><q>As if I could do that! As if I could own I
was in your confidence over so disgraceful an
affair! It's an insult to me,</q> she exclaimed,
withdrawing her hands from his shoulders, and
standing back a pace or two from him. <q>It comes
to this, Guy,</q> she went on, speaking slowly and
deliberately, <q>you must choose between me and
your dancing-girl.</q></p>

<p><q>You're talking foolishly. There's no question
of rivalry between you and this child! It's too
ridiculous. You're missing the point entirely.
My choice lies between my love for you and my
oath to my dead friend—my friend to whom I owe
my life.</q></p>

<p><q>Put it that way if you like—I don't care.</q></p>

<p><q>I stand by my oath,</q> said he doggedly.</p>

<p>Clare started as though he had struck her. Her
eyes blazed, and she shook with passion.</p>

<p><q>And you say that coolly after I have given
you my whole love. All I have is yours, Guy.
You know it is—whatever happens,</q> said she
huskily.</p>

<p><q>It's not my fault. You've forced the position
on me.</q></p>

<p><q>But think what you're about to do. Oh, it
will be your ruin! Do be persuaded. Don't act
like a madman! You told me to-night you loved
me. Am I to believe that you're a hypocrite?
that—that——</q></p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands. Her
passion had spent itself. She was on the verge
of hysterics.</p>

<pb n="52"/>
<p>At that moment the silence was broken by the
noise of buggy wheels and the voice of a native
coachman flinging opprobrious epithets at the
horse's female relatives. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope had re-
turned.</p>

<p>Horsford felt horribly embarrassed. Clare's
emotion was certain to attract the attention of
the keen-eyed doctor, and what explanation could
be given? But he need not have troubled him-
self. Clare, in a marvellous manner, pulled herself
together. She went smilingly towards the window
to meet her uncle. As she passed Horsford she
whispered:</p>

<p><q>There's your hat on the chair. You were just
taking your leave. Do you understand?</q></p>

<p>Horsford did so only partially. It could not be
said he understood Clare. She was certainly acting
now, and a disturbing thought crossed his mind—
had she been acting all along?</p>

<p>The doctor's voice was heard outside. Horsford,
hat in hand, followed Clare to the window. <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Stanhope caught sight of him over Clare's shoulder.</p>

<p><q>Ah, Horsford,</q> said the doctor, in the soothing,
pleasant, even voice of the medical man, the
majority of whose patients are ladies, <q>so you were
able to tear yourself away from the Rajah's
hospitality. It generally becomes very pronounced
after midnight. His Highness has some wonder-
ful wines, not a drop of which he ever tastes.
He's above temptation—in that way. I was
very sorry I could not put in an appearance. I
hoped to do so, but the eternal feminine inter-
vened, as usual.</q></p>

<p><q>How is <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Foord?</q> asked Clare.</p>

<pb n="53"/>
<p><q>Going on splendidly, and the baby too—a
remarkably fine boy. His father and I christened
him over a bottle of champagne.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope was in good humour, partly be-
cause of the champagne, partly because the pro-
fessional business which had prevented him from
being at the Rajah's Palace had given him no
anxiety. He did not notice Horsford's embarrass-
ment. The two men chatted for a few minutes,
chiefly about the Rajah's dinner-party, but Hors-
ford said nothing of the episode of the dancing-
girl. He could hardly do so in Clare's presence;
indeed, he was not inclined to go into the story
again with any one, and after bidding the doctor
good-night he looked round for Clare, but she
was gone. He was not sorry he was spared the
embarrassment of bidding her farewell after their
tiff, but for all that he left the bungalow moody
and unhinged.</p>

<p>It was inevitable, due to the crisis of that night,
that his thoughts should be fixed on himself. His
life, like that of most of his comrades, had drifted
along aimlessly. He had gambled, hunted, ridden
his horses on the Delhi race-course, danced, flirted,
and occasionally <soCalled>gone the pace,</soCalled> coming back to
reason and repentance when the Delhi bank
intimated politely that his account was overdrawn.
He could have married over and over again, but
married life in India did not attract him. The
number of happy marriages, the marriages, at
least, of military officers, could be counted on one's
fingers. Nor had he been entangled in a serious,
all-absorbing love affair. Flirtations had come
and gone and left him heart-whole.</p>

<pb n="54"/>
<p>But could he make that boast now? He hated
to think of his folly, because bound up with it
was the feeling that he had been disillusioned.
He had imagined that beneath Clare's frivolity and
love of admiration and pleasure there was the real
heart of a woman. Until he had taken her into
confidence over the dancing-girl he did not doubt
her sincerity, but what was that sincerity worth?
It had failed at the first test. Her prudishness
struck him as a contradiction. She had been
quick to return his ardent kisses—she had been as
quick to treat him with icy coldness over what
Simla society would think.</p>

<p><q>Perhaps it's as well our folly's ended. Had
we married I suppose we should have passed our
time in bickering. Clare would have spent half
the year at Simla and I should have stuck at
Delhi—and what would happen then?</q></p>

<p>He resolved to think no more about Clare.
She had taken her course, let her continue in it if
she chose.</p>

<p>He had about half a mile to walk to his bungalow.
The road ascended all the way and the cool breeze
and the exertion steadied his nerves. As he
approached the gate of the compound a figure
rose from the deep shadow of the trees to his
right and confronted him. His first thought was
that he was about to be attacked by one of the
<foreign xml:lang="hi">goojurs</foreign> of whom Clare had jestingly spoken, but
before he had time for a second he saw there was
no cause for alarm. The stranger was a woman and
unveiled, showing that she was not of high rank.</p>

<p><q>Sahib—Sahib,</q> she whispered excitedly, <q>you
must come with me at once.</q></p>

<pb n="55"/>
<p><q>Who are you? What do you want?</q></p>

<p><q>I am Azeena. Does not your lordship remem-
ber Nara's ayah? I knew the Sahib the instant
my eyes lighted upon him at the Rajah's Palace.
If you would save the girl do not delay one instant.
Ah, she is in great peril! My poor—poor Nara.
Sahib, you must bring your pistol and sword.
There may be fighting, but Hoosein Khan is a
coward—they are all cowards—aye, even the
Rajah. He is in the plot, too!</q></p>

<p>Horsford recollected the woman. It was she
who played the <foreign xml:lang="hi">saringhee</foreign>, and who afterwards was
standing in the curtained doorway with a group
of dancing-girls when he led Nara back to the hall
after she had recovered from her fainting fit.
Azeena was trembling from head to foot with ex-
citement. Her words tumbled from her quivering
lips so rapidly that Horsford at first did not grasp
their full meaning. But it was sufficient for him
to know that the girl was in great danger.</p>

<p><q>Quiet yourself. Tell me everything slowly—
slowly. Do you understand?</q> said he, clasping her
wrists firmly.</p>

<p>The touch of Horsford's muscular hands restored
her to something like calmness, and she explained
that Hoosein Khan was under a bond to deliver
the girl to Zeenut Mehal, the intriguing Queen of
Delhi. He was to have a large sum of money
when Nara was safely within the Palace. For
the last two years he had been bargaining with
the Queen, who had heard reports of the dancing-
girl's beauty and accomplishments, and also knew
her origin, and at last the sum was fixed. Hoosein
Khan was on his way to Delhi, and the Rajah,
<pb n="56"/>
hearing that the troupe were passing through Simla,
had engaged them to entertain his guests.</p>

<p><q>The bond Hoosein Khan signed with Zeenut
Mehal's agent forbade him letting Nara dance
before any one lest some rich man should become
drunk with her grace and loveliness and detain
her,</q> whispered Azeena. <q>Zeenut Mehal has
promised her pampered boy, Jewan Bukht, a
beautiful plaything, and he and his wicked mother
would make sport with the girl!</q></p>

<p><q>My God, it's infamous!</q> burst out Horsford.</p>

<p>He stamped the ground in his fury. Jewan
Bukht was a sickly boy of twelve or thirteen and
a man in wickedness. Zeenut Mehal pandered
to his vices and there was no pleasure he fancied
she did not gratify. Could she have had her way
she would, at the death of old Bahadur Shah, have
seated him on the throne in the place of the rightful
heir, Mirza Moghul, the king's eldest son.</p>

<p><q>Hoosein Khan would sell every drop of blood
in his withered body for gold,</q> cried the woman;
<q>the Rajah tempted him and he broke the bond.
If it reached the ears of Zeenut Mehal he would
know what the whip was like, and not a single
rupee would she part with. The Rajah wanted
the girl to dance to him alone, but Hoosein
Khan was afraid of the Queen's vengeance. He
would only consent if Englishmen were present.
He thought if the story reached the Palace that
Zeenut Mehal's anger would be softened when she
knew English officers were of the company. The
English sahibs are not shameless like our princes.</q></p>

<p><q>That's enough,</q> interrupted Horsford hastily.
<q>Nara must be rescued. When the truth is known
<pb n="57"/>
I'll swear the Resident will support me. Do you
know where the Rajah's placed the girl?</q></p>

<p><q>In an upper room in the Palace. My own
cousin perfumes the hair of the ladies of the <foreign xml:lang="hi">zenana</foreign>
—she has promised to help me. But we must
go at once. Hoosein Khan will not rest until he
has the girl safely inside the King's Palace. He is
thinking of his skin and of his rupees. Do you
not see, Sahib, that it is to his interest to deliver
the girl to Zeenut Mehal before the gossip finds its
way to her ears? But he may not be able to get
away as soon as he hopes. The Rajah may delay
him. The Rajah fears Zeenut Mehal, but, Sahib,
he may be tempted—who knows? Yet all is in
the hands of Allah. I pray He may protect my
poor Nara.</q></p>

<p><q>Wait here, Azeena. I'll get the buggy and——</q></p>

<p><q>No, no, Sahib,</q> she interrupted. <q>It is of no
use going as if you were on a visit of ceremony to
the Rajah. You will be put off with lies. You
must go on foot and creep into the Palace like a
<foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">dacoit</foreign>. It is nearly three <foreign xml:lang="hi">coss</foreign> by road from here
to the Palace, but I know a short cut over the hills.
It will save quite one <foreign xml:lang="hi">coss</foreign> and you will get there
as soon as you would in the buggy.</q></p>

<p><q>That means a walk of two <foreign xml:lang="hi">coss</foreign>—four miles.
Very well, then, let us start.</q></p>

</div>




<div n="5" type="chapter">

<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="5">V</num></head>
<head type="main">Gone!</head>

<p>Soon they were beneath the deodars, tramping
through an undergrowth which to unaccustomed
eyes would have seemed impenetrable. Azeena,
however, forced her way through with perfect
confidence, guided by certain indications which she
knew. The path led to the summit of a hill,
at the foot of which was the winding road by which
they would have travelled had they taken the buggy.
By the time they had reached the top and were
proceeding along the ridge there were signs of
breaking day and the wind felt cold and raw. In-
deed in exposed spots the grass was crisp with
frost, and as dawn advanced clouds of mist settled
below, obscuring the road and the few bungalows
which at that time dotted the landscape.</p>

<p>An hour later they were descending the ridge,
and the pale yellow tinge in the eastern sky was
heralding the sun. The scenery was wild and
romantic. To the south were forests of deodar,
interspersed with deep, verdure-lined gorges, broad
valleys on the slopes of which the rhododendrons
flourished and bloomed in every variety of colour.
To the north were more forests, gradually ascending
until they gave place to the dim outline of hill upon
<pb n="59"/>
hill, stretching away higher and higher, their
summits melting in the distance in low clouds.
Beyond these clouds were the Himalayas and the
line of perpetual snow.</p>

<p>The dawn told them they were near their destina-
tion. Through the blue mist Horsford could
discern the cupola surmounting the hall of the
Rajah's Palace.</p>

<p><q>Let us hasten,</q> whispered Azeena. <q>Some
of the servants may be about. It is a pity daylight
is coming on, but Zora is on the watch; she will
guide us by a secret way into the Palace. The
mists are our friends.</q></p>

<p>Five minutes more, and Horsford heard a low,
mournful note, as of a bird calling to its mate.
The answer came soft and prolonged, ceased for
a couple of seconds, and was resumed for a brief
space. Azeena suddenly turned and faced Hors-
ford.</p>

<p><q>Zora has answered my signal. We must be
careful. That is the meaning of two whistles—
one long and one short.</q></p>

<p>The note which Horsford thought was that of a
bird came from the lips of the women.</p>

<p><q>Wait till I call to you, Sahib,</q> she suddenly
whispered.</p>

<p>Azeena struck off to the right, and Horsford
lost sight of her in the mist. For a moment he
suspected treachery.</p>

<p><q>I am here, Sahib,</q> Azeena's voice came from
below. Horsford slid down the bank and found
the woman awaiting him in the dry bed of a nullah,
through which a torrent swirled and eddied during
the monsoon.</p>

<pb n="60"/>
<p>They went on for some fifty yards and the great
stone wall of the well supplying the Palace came into
sight. The well was a piece of solid masonry with
a circular platform, of whiter stone than the rest,
for the drawers of water to sit on while they let
down their pitchers by the rope attached to the
side of the well. The outline of a woman dressed
in a dark robe was silhouetted on the white stone.
An earthen pitcher was by her side. She rose
when Azeena and Horsford emerged from the
wreaths of mist, and came hastily towards them.
She was unveiled and her face was troubled.</p>

<p><q>Why did you not come before?</q> she cried.
<q>I have been sitting here an hour—shaking with
cold and fearing discovery. I brought a pitcher
to show that I had come to the well for water,
lest I might not be believed. You are too late,
Sahib. Hoosein Khan and his party are gone
and they have taken Nara with them. Had
Azeena come back at once as she promised——</q></p>

<p><q>I could not. I had to wait for the Sahib,</q>
interrupted Azeena. <q>I thought to reach his
bungalow before him, but the Sahib did not come.
It was not his fault. How could he tell I was
expecting him? He had important business,
doubtless, that delayed him.</q></p>

<p>Important business? Folly—folly—folly!
Horsford ground his teeth when he thought of it.
Clare Stanhope had indeed come between him and
his oath to poor Jack Folliott!</p>

<p><q>That will do,</q> Horsford broke out impatiently.
<q>What's the good of wasting time in useless ex-
planations? Hoosein Khan's taken the child to
Delhi, I suppose. Well, I have but to follow him.</q></p>

<pb n="61"/>
<p><q>The Sahib must not go alone,</q> cried Zora
wildly. <q>The Rajah has sent a dozen of his
fighting men to guard Hoosein Khan and his
dancing-girls on the road. They are to travel
with all speed. Let the girl go, Sahib. What has
she to do with you?</q></p>

<p>Horsford paid no attention to Zora's pleadings.
He was thinking out his own plans.</p>

<p><q>Azeena,</q> said he suddenly, <q>do you love
Nara?</q></p>

<p><q>As the apple of my eye, Sahib,</q> cried the
woman, clasping her hands.</p>

<p><q>Then we'll do our best to save her. How
does the party travel, Zora?</q></p>

<p><q>By <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign>, Sahib. They have gone by the
Meerut road.</q></p>

<p><q>By far the longest way. That's to throw me
off the scent. Good! And the soldiers—are
they mounted?</q></p>

<p><q>No. His Highness the Rajah would not let
his horses be used.</q></p>

<p><q>Humph! much obliged to his highness. <foreign xml:lang="hi">Bahlees</foreign>
drawn by oxen and men on the tramp—not much
more than two miles an hour taking the day
throughout. Azeena, we must get back to Simla
sharp—that's the first thing to do.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, Sahib.</q></p>

<p>The woman fixed her large, patient eyes, as
faithful and as watchful as those of a dog, on the
Sahib-logue—the man of the master race. Azeena
did not trouble to think what the Sahib proposed
to do but resigned herself to his orders.</p>

<p>Zora crept away, rejoicing at the liberal back-
sheesh the Sahib had given her, and well pleased
<pb n="62"/>
to be free of a matter which might land her in
disgrace, and Azeena and Horsford set out on
their way back to Simla. It was between three
and four when they reached his bungalow. The
day had begun, and the servants were about their
various duties. They salaamed to their master
and showed no surprise at the sight of his com-
panion. If they had any opinion at all it was that
Azeena was neither so young nor so handsome a
woman as the Sahib might have selected.</p>

<p>The ayah was exhausted; Horsford ordered a
meal to be prepared for her, and went out to make
arrangements for proceeding by <foreign xml:lang="hi">dâk</foreign> to Delhi.
He reckoned that at the slow pace at which Hoosein
Khan would be compelled to travel his journey
<foreign xml:lang="la">via</foreign> Meerut would occupy at least eight days,
whereas by <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">dâk</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="la">via</foreign> Ambala and Karnal it ought
not to take more than half that time to do the
one hundred and seventy miles to Delhi.</p>

<p>Luck that morning was on his side. He heard
that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt, the mother of an official con-
nected with the Delhi bank, was also travelling
by <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">dâk</foreign> and was starting at six o'clock. He knew
the lady very well, and he begged her to allow
Azeena to join her staff of servants. Again luck
befriended him. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt's own ayah had
taken herself off unexpectedly that very morning,
after the irresponsible, erratic fashion of Indian
servants, and the services of Azeena came in
very handy. Horsford invented some plausible
excuse why he was interested in the woman and
was anxious to assist her in getting to Delhi, and
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt, who was only too glad to be relieved
from a difficulty, asked no inconvenient questions.</p>

<pb n="63"/>
<p>This matter settled, and his own palanquin and
runners hired, Horsford raced back to his bungalow,
gave Azeena her directions, snatched an hour's
sleep, had his bath, dismissed his servants with
liberal backsheesh after his modicum of luggage
was packed, and walked leisurely down to the
starting-point. He met Major Ormerod, mounted
on a trotting horse, to <soCalled>shake up</soCalled> his liver after
the Rajah's banquet of the night before.</p>

<p><q>Hallo, Horsford,</q> shouted the Major. <q>What
became of you last night? You slipped away
mysteriously. We thought you'd eloped with the
little dancer, until the Rajah assured us that the
difficulty between you and that evil-looking Mussul-
man scoundrel had been settled amicably, the girl
being taken from the fellow's custody and lodged
in the <foreign xml:lang="hi">zenana</foreign>. Is our fat friend going to add one
more to his long list of wives?</q></p>

<p><q>How do I know?</q> rejoined Horsford shortly.</p>

<p><q>Anyhow, it would be the best way out of
the difficulty. I suppose the old rascal of a
Mahommedan satisfied you the girl was his grand-
daughter. But why didn't you join us again?
We were all on the <foreign xml:lang="fr">qui vive</foreign> to know what had
happened.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I'd had enough of the fun. Good-bye,
old chap. I'm off to Delhi.</q></p>

<p><q>What?</q></p>

<p><q>Found a letter waiting me when I got back
here last night, calling me away on important
business. Can I take any messages for you?</q></p>

<p><q>I can't think of any for the moment. When
do you start?</q></p>

<p><q>At once. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt has already gone on.</q></p>

<pb n="64"/>
<p><q>Are you acting as her escort?</q> said the Major,
with a grin.</p>

<p><q>In a way, yes. Not much danger of my falling
in love on the way, I imagine.</q></p>

<p><q>No, by gad. A most amiable woman but
one of the ugliest. Her looks protect her.</q></p>

<p>Horsford made no reply, but shook hands with
the Major and strode away to his palanquin.
Ormerod stayed long enough to see the men raise
the conveyance and set off at a smart pace, which
it was quite certain they would not long keep up,
and slowly trotted away.</p>

<p><q>Close beggar,</q> muttered the Major. <q>He's
not one to let the right hand know what the left
hand's doing. I wonder what's the real story of
the little dancing-girl. It struck me the Rajah
was talking with his tongue in his cheek. I guess
he's come to some arrangement with Horsford.
Lead us not into temptation! If there's any
prayer useful in India that's the one.</q></p>

<p>Then the Major proceeded on the process of
<soCalled>shaking up,</soCalled> and meeting a couple of friends bent
on a similar undertaking, forgot Horsford and the
dancing-girl.</p>

<p>The day wore on without any more excitement
than a Simla day usually afforded, which was as
a rule none at all. At noon all life died away;
the English visitors kept within doors, the natives
squatted in the shade of verandahs and drowsily
surveyed the world. About six o'clock slumbering
Simla awoke.</p>

<p>A pony carriage drew up in front of Horsford's
bungalow. The smartly dressed girl who had
been driving threw the reins to her servant and
<pb n="65"/>
hastily stepped out. A <foreign xml:lang="hi">chokadar</foreign> who was in the
verandah came forward and salaamed.</p>

<p><q>Is Sahib Horsford at home?</q></p>

<p><q>The Sahib has gone.</q></p>

<p><q>Gone? What do you mean?</q></p>

<p>The sudden sharpening of the pitch of the voice
told that the girl had a temper that was easily
roused. The <foreign xml:lang="hi">chokadar</foreign> proclaimed himself the
most miserable of men. He was but a worm in
the sight of the mem-sahib. It was not his fault
that the lord sahib had departed that morning for
Delhi.</p>

<p><q>For Delhi? You are uttering lies,</q> burst out
the girl passionately.</p>

<p>The <foreign xml:lang="hi">chokadar</foreign> prostrated himself morally and
physically. He called upon several Hindu deities
to witness that he spoke the truth.</p>

<p><q>Did Sahib Horsford tell you this cock-and-bull
story?</q> cried the visitor, all the brilliancy of
her complexion disappearing under her rage, save
one scarlet spot on each cheek bone.</p>

<p>The phrase <q>cock and bull</q> was evidently
unknown to the <foreign xml:lang="hi">chokadar</foreign>. He stared vacantly,
and then, conscious he was expected to return an
answer of some kind, stammered out that he had
seen the Sahib depart that morning, and that if
the mem-sahib did not believe him she might ask
the <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">dâk</foreign> agent, who would confirm his statement.</p>

<p>The mem-sahib possibly decided to adopt this
suggestion, for without another word she wheeled
round abruptly and returned to the pony carriage.</p>

<p><q>Guy hasn't gone to Delhi,</q> she muttered.
<q>He said that to throw dust in the eyes of the
servants. He is at the Dakhur Palace. He told
<pb n="66"/>
me he meant to visit the Rajah to-day and demand
the child.</q></p>

<p>It was not etiquette to call on the Rajah. He
never received English lady visitors, nor did he
ever enter the houses of his English men friends.
But for that Clare Stanhope would have gone
direct to his Highness and have questioned him
concerning Guy Horsford and the girl. In a white
heat of fury she flung herself in the low seat,
snatched the reins from the servant's hands, and
seized the whip. A slash across the ponies'
flanks sent the animals rearing, another savage
cut brought them to their feet and they darted
away at a break-neck pace. There was no danger
save running against some lumbering, oxen-drawn,
village cart, for the road was wide and a steep
ascent lay in front. Before the ponies had tackled
fifty yards of the hill they dropped into a walk,
blown, and the sweat pouring down their sides.</p>

<p>On the level road Clare resumed her furious driv-
ing and narrowly escaped collision with a <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign>,
under the tilt of which sat a fat Hindu merchant
who, when he saw the ponies charging at him,
doubted the virtue of the auspicious omens which
had decided him to undertake his journey that
day. The danger Clare had escaped acted as a
wholesome counter irritant. She decided to follow
the <foreign xml:lang="hi">chokadar's</foreign> advice, and turning the carriage
round she drove slowly back to the office of the
<foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">dâk</foreign> agent. The clerk, a smooth-speaking, obse-
quious Eurasian, assured her that Captain Horsford
had indeed started that morning for Delhi.</p>

<p><q>Why has he gone there? I must know. I
<emph>will</emph> know,</q> she murmured fiercely.</p>

<pb n="67"/>
<p>Who was most likely to be in Guy's confidence?
She could think of no one but Major Ormerod, and
she sent the ponies at a walking pace past the club,
only a primitive affair in the fifties, and very
different (as indeed is everything else in Simla)
from its successor of the present day.</p>

<p>Half a dozen men were lounging in the verandah,
sipping brandy pawnee as an appetiser. They
doffed their hats when Clare approached, and she
smiled sweetly upon them. Her appearance was
a pleasant oasis in the monotony of waiting for
dinner, and directly she stopped Ormerod and
young Anson came towards her.</p>

<p>A few commonplaces, and Clare led the talk to
the subject uppermost in her mind. But she did
it in an indirect way.</p>

<p><q>I hope you had a merry time last night at the
Rajah's,</q> said she, as she deftly flicked a fly from
the ear of one of her little steeds.</p>

<p><q>Well, it was exciting rather than merry,</q> said
Ormerod, hesitatingly.</p>

<p><q>I didn't find it either the one or the other,
Miss Stanhope,</q> struck in the Cornet, his honest
eyes fixed with undisguised admiration on Clare's
loveliness. <q>Give me a hop at the Argyll Rooms
or Cremorne before all your Indian Nautch girls.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm afraid you're a very bad boy,</q> said Clare,
shaking her head.</p>

<p><q>No, really I'm not,</q> protested the lad, taking
her quite seriously. <q>I found the Indian dancing-
girls awfully slow, and I left very early, didn't I,
Major Ormerod?</q></p>

<p>Clare could see quite well that Cornet Anson
knew nothing about the episode of Horsford and
<pb n="68"/>
the fainting dancing-girl. But it was otherwise
with Ormerod.</p>

<p><q>I beg your pardon, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Anson. I begin now
to think you're good. But you might be better—
if for instance you could get me a cup of tea.
Perhaps, though, I'm taxing the resources of the
club too much,</q> said Clare sweetly.</p>

<p><q>Nonsense. I'll see that you have it, and
precious sharp, too.</q></p>

<p>The ingenuous youth darted away, and Clare,
turning to Ormerod, said rapidly:</p>

<p><q>You and your friends had adventures last
night, I'm told, Major. Young Anson, I presume,
knows nothing of the later entertainment, or he
would not have run down the dancing-girls of
India. The Rajah provided an unexpected enter-
tainment, didn't he?</q></p>

<p>Clare's voice was as dulcet as ever; her eyes
alone betrayed anxiety. Ormerod was shrewd
enough to detect her disquietude. He knew that
of late she and Horsford had been a good deal
together, and he was far too loyal to give a com-
rade away.</p>

<p><q>A case of pumping, is it,</q> he thought. <q>I
wonder how she's got hold of the story? All right,
my dear, you won't squeeze much out of me.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, it was interesting—in a way,</q> said he.
<q>What happened, I fancy, was as unexpected by
the Rajah as by anybody else. One of the dancing-
girls fainted, but it was nothing serious. Of course
she didn't dance any more.</q></p>

<p><q>Was that all? You don't seem to have seen
much,</q> retorted Clare. <q>Wasn't there some
disturbance—some squabble? Didn't Captain
<pb n="69"/>
Horsford raise a protest?—I don't know what
about.</q></p>

<p><q>I believe there was a word or two said,</q> re-
turned Ormerod guardedly. <q>The girl, it appears,
had an English father, and Horsford has advanced
views on the question of Eurasians. Nothing
came of it. The Rajah has the girl in safe custody.
She's in his <foreign xml:lang="hi">zenana</foreign> at present.</q></p>

<p>Sweet and bitter. It was comforting for Clare
to know that the girl was practically out of Hors-
ford's reach. But what had taken Guy to Delhi?
His only object, so far as Clare could see, was that
he might separate himself from her.</p>

<p><q>What's the girl like?</q> she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Ormerod was too much of a man of the world
to commit the mistake of praising one woman to
another. The fact that in this case the dancing-
girl was a child in years made no difference. More-
over, there was mystery in Clare Stanhope's
curiosity, and contrary to the accepted opinion,
Ormerod held that with a woman curiosity was
never idle. There was always a personal motive
mixed with it, and its exercise generally meant
some revelation of character. So instead of de-
scribing Nara as the most fascinating and graceful
little creature he had ever seen, which would have
been the truth, Ormerod merely shrugged his
shoulders, and said that there was nothing re-
markable about her, excepting that the cast of
her features belonged more to the West than the
East.</p>

<p><q>I thought you were a judge of beauty, Major
Ormerod,</q> rejoined Clare irritably.</p>

<p><q>I know when loveliness is presented to me,</q>
<pb n="70"/>
said the Major, dropping his voice and fixing his
eyes on the dainty figure in the carriage.</p>

<p>The compliment was, of course, unmistakable,
and under other circumstances Clare would have
replied with some bright sally, but now the slight
wrinkling of her brows and the momentary tighten-
ing of her lips showed that she was not in the
mood for exchanges of banter. A diversion was
caused at this moment by Anson issuing from the
bungalow, followed by a <foreign xml:lang="hi">khidmutgar</foreign> bearing a tray
on which was the promised tea. If she meant to
question Ormerod further without interruption
she would have to lose no time.</p>

<p><q>Did you know Captain Horsford had gone to
Delhi?</q> said she.</p>

<p><q>Yes. I met him this morning by chance just
as he was about to start. He told me he had a
letter last night calling him away on important
business.</q></p>

<p><q>Private, or anything to do with his duties?</q></p>

<p><q>My dear young lady, I didn't ask. I'm not
a woman, you know.</q></p>

<p>Ormerod could not resist the retort. Much as
he admired Clare Stanhope, he did not like her.
He put her down as vain, shallow, and insincere,
but he may have been influenced by what his wife
said. Fierce is the light in Anglo-Indian Society
that beats on good-looking spinsters, widows, grass
and otherwise, and what used to be known as
<soCalled>frisky matrons.</soCalled> <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod, who prided
herself on keeping up what she called a <soCalled>high
tone,</soCalled> was inclined to be a severe critic of manners
and morals, and certain points in Clare Stanhope
did not meet with her approval.</p>

<pb n="71"/>
<p>Clare could have delivered a crushing reply to
Ormerod, for it was well known that the Major
was thoroughly hen-pecked, but she did not trouble
herself. She had thought for no one but Guy,
and the confirmation by Ormerod of what the
<foreign xml:lang="hi">chokadar</foreign> had told her did not tend to allay her
agitation. She took the tea without a word of
thanks to young Anson, greatly to the disappoint-
ment of the lad, who had expended his stock
of abusive Hindustani in hurrying the native <foreign xml:lang="fr">chef</foreign>.</p>

<p>After leaving half the vapid concoction Clare
gathered up the reins and with a nod and a smile—
not one of her best—she started the ponies into a
trot and left the Major and the Cornet, their hats
in their hands, watching her and admiring the
way she <q>handled the ribbons.</q></p>

<div n="6" type="chapter">
<pb n="72"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="6">VI</num></head>
<head type="main">The Eternal Question</head>

<p>For the next five minutes the one topic of con-
versation was Clare Stanhope. The presence of
the attractive belle of Simla had brought every
member of the club to the verandah, and tongues
wagged at considerable length concerning her
charms and her prospects.</p>

<p><q>Gad, I'll bet the doctor'll find her a handful
before long,</q> chuckled red-faced Colonel Chowden.
<q>I'm told her relatives packed her off to India
because she was too much for them. The sooner
she's married the better.</q></p>

<p><q>For the doctor—yes. But what about her
husband?</q> said Ormerod.</p>

<p>Then they fell to discussing two questions of
absorbing interest, one which makes the whole
world akin—the mystery of woman in general—
and the other appealing to Europeans in India
only—the native woman. It was hard to say
which at the moment was the more important.
The competition of the West with the East had of
late years been gradually increasing. India had
become the marriage market for the dowerless girl
of Britain with rich and influential relatives and
connections in the East India Company. The
<pb n="73"/>
white woman was beginning to assert herself, and
the olive-skinned maidens were retiring before
the advance of their aggressive rivals.</p>

<p>Old associations and habits die hard. Some of
the grey-headed members of the Simla Club had
as youngsters fought in the Pindaree War and
against Holkar, and the memories of two septua-
genarians went back as far as Assaye. Their
opinions on the eternal feminine were those ex-
pressed by an old Calcutta journalist, whose
illuminating words may appropriately be quoted.</p>

<p><q>Nearly all the unmarried Europeans—and few
were married in those days—lived,</q> he writes, <q>in
acknowledged concubinage with native women.</q></p>

<p>In 1810 a work called <title>The East Indian Vade
Mecum</title> was published by Captain T. Williamson.
The object was to provide a compendium of in-
formation valuable to persons about to settle in
India, and was dedicated to the Honourable Court
of Directors of the East India Company, as de-
signed particularly to be a guide to young gentle-
men in their service. In this work concubinage is
regarded as a matter of ordinary necessity, and
advice is given as to the female establishment a
young man should set up, its proper cost, etc.</p>

<p>The impossibility of marriage with English
women is shown by the declaration that an English
lady could not be landed in India <q>under respect-
able circumstances throughout for less than £500,</q>
and the connections recommended are justified by
the statement that <q>the number of European
women to be found in Bengal and its dependencies
cannot amount to two hundred and fifty; while
the European male inhabitants of respectability,
<pb n="74"/>
including military officers, may be taken at about
four thousand.</q></p>

<p><q>What's the good of a youngster making up to
an English girl?</q> growled old Colonel Chowden.
<q>Of course she's sent out to be married, and in
that respect dashed if I see much difference between
her and the Hindu. Everybody knows that the
native girls have no choice or voice in their mar-
riage. The parents fix up matters, and brides
and bridegrooms don't set eyes on each other
till the wedding day. The marvel is that these
leaps in the dark rarely turn out badly. It's the
other way about. By Jove, the Hindu wench is
the most faithful and obedient of wives. That's
more than you can say of some of the flaunters
who come out here and sell themselves to the
highest bidder.</q></p>

<p><q>And why shouldn't they? It's perfectly well
understood what brings them. The more the
merrier, I say. We get some decent society, and
if there's a scandal now and again, what does it
matter? It makes conversation, anyhow,</q> said
Lawton, a simpering sub, who rather fancied
himself as a lady-killer.</p>

<p><q>Conversation!</q> snorted Ormerod. <q>Is that
the end of the business?</q></p>

<p>A silence fell on the group. Ormerod's words
had given them something to think about. Social
questions did not attract much attention in India
in the fifties but they existed all the same, and
now and again the sex problem forced its way
to the front, was discussed in whispers, and put
out of sight as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><q>Scandals can't be avoided,</q> said an elderly
<pb n="75"/>
magistrate. <q>The rich men the English girls
hope to capture are not very numerous. The girl
has to put up with what she can get. Perhaps
no one suitable comes along, and while she's waiting
she forgets what she was sent to India for and
falls in love with the wrong man. Sometimes she
makes the still greater blunder of falling in love
with the wrong man after she's married. All this
is very interesting, but it's only part of the question
we started with. The point is what are the poor
devils with empty pockets to do? The English
girls, of course, are out of their reach. What
then? I should say the man of the old days was
better off with his left-handed arrangement which
was then accepted by everybody. What has he
to do now?</q></p>

<p><q>Won't you tell us, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Roberts?</q> said the
ingenuous Anson, when the magistrate paused.</p>

<p>Every one listened intently for the reply.</p>

<p><q>Humph! You want to know, do you? Very
good, then I'll tell you, but don't forget that I'm
not sitting as a magistrate bound to utter moral
platitudes, and leaving the bedrock of things alone.
The young man of to-day must either live econo-
mically and comfortably with the woman who
will be faithful to him and worship him as if he
were her god, or he must waste his substance on a
dancing-girl. In the one case he ruins his char-
acter—in the opinion of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grundy, do you
understand? in the other he ruins himself, body,
purse, and prospects. Now——</q></p>

<p>But the dinner-gong sounded, and perhaps it
was just as well.</p>

<p>While the members of the Simla Club were
<pb n="76"/>
discussing sociology in its most engrossing aspect
Clare Stanhope, from whom the question sprang,
was racing up the hilly road to her uncle's bungalow,
her nerves by no means soothed by her interview
with Ormerod. Guy Horsford's disappearance
still puzzled and worried her. She had derived
no comfort from the information that the dancing-
girl was in the Rajah's <foreign xml:lang="hi">zenana</foreign>.</p>

<p><q>What do I care about the girl?</q> she asked
herself furiously. <q>Guy angered me by treating
the affair with so much importance and putting me
in the background. Of course I was silly to fly out
at him, but it was his fault. He showed dread-
fully bad taste in talking of the girl at all to me.
Up to that point we were the best of friends
and——</q></p>

<p>She paused. A dreamy look stole into her eyes.
Friendship hardly expressed the situation. If
love ever had possession of her it was during those
stolen moments which she would never think of
without a thrill. Everything was so new. The
Clare Stanhope who smiled and enticed number-
less admirers, while at the same time she kept
them at bay, was not the Clare Stanhope who
returned Guy Horsford's passionate kisses. Then
a fresh mood seized her—she was filled with
remorse. She reproached Guy, she reproached
herself.</p>

<p><q>Why couldn't he see I didn't mean what I
said? I was right to be angry, but I felt sure
he would call this morning to make it up. Oh,
he's heartless—cold and heartless!</q> were the
words that hammered themselves on her brain.</p>

<p>It was a bitter lesson for Clare, who had always
<pb n="77"/>
boasted that she could bring men to their knees by
a frown or a pout, when Guy Horsford did not
present himself for forgiveness the next morning
as she confidently expected. She had not hitherto
realised that there was a gulf between idle flirta-
tion and serious passion, although the confines of
that gulf are sometimes extremely narrow. <foreign xml:lang="fr">On
ne badine pas avec l'amour</foreign> was a truth of which
she had not been conscious until now.</p>

<p><q>I ought not to have let him go without saying
good-night,</q> she murmured.</p>

<p>Despondency succeeded to rage by the time
she had reached home. She flung the reins
languidly to the <foreign xml:lang="hi">syce</foreign>, and entered the bungalow
with dragging feet. Then a gleam of hope seized
her. Perhaps Guy had written. She sent her
ayah to inquire. The woman came back with
a letter. Clare seized it with feverish haste, and
the next instant dashed it on the table. She
recognised the writing. It was not Guy Horsford's
but Andrew Meldrum's.</p>

<p><q>That man! I hate him.</q></p>

<p>She sank into a chair, feeling that she was near-
ing a crisis in her life which she had not the courage
to meet. Yet it must be met. Guy Horsford,
the man she loved, was gone—sent away by her-
self. That was the galling part of the business.
Could she humble herself sufficiently to write
and beg him to come back? Scarcely in her pre-
sent mood. Besides, had she not suffered severely
enough from being too precipitate? She would
not make a second mistake of that kind.</p>

<p><q>He shall have time. It will take him a few
days to reach Delhi. He may not write at once,
<pb n="78"/>
and the mail will have to bring his letter. I'll
give him a fortnight,</q> she thought.</p>

<p>A fortnight? It seemed an eternity. How
could she endure it? She sat for five or six
minutes staring blankly at Meldrum's letter on the
table. Then with an impatient gesture she seized
it and tore open the envelope. She read the
contents without showing the least sign of emotion.
Yet it was a letter which should have stirred her
pulses, fond as she was of money and of what
money could buy. She had only to write the
word <q>yes</q> and she would become the wife of
the richest man in India.</p>

<p>There was no hesitation in Andrew Meldrum's
offer of marriage. He was as business-like in this
as in everything else. He even named the sum
he proposed to settle upon her, and the amount
did not err on the side of niggardliness. He wound
up by saying that he proposed to call that night
for her reply, and this was the only part of the
letter which quickened her heart-beats.</p>

<p><q>I can't see him—I won't see him. I—I would
say no, but—but I dare not. I must give Guy a
chance. Yes, I <emph>must</emph>,</q> she cried hurriedly.</p>

<p>It was easy to feign illness, and indeed in this
excuse there was as much reality as pretence.
She hurriedly scribbled a note, thanking Meldrum
for his letter. She promised to give him an
answer very speedily, but that at present she was
suffering from a distracting headache which had
quite prostrated her. She read over what she
had written and it seemed to her that to a man like
Meldrum it looked more of an encouragement than
the reverse. But short of a decided negative it
<pb n="79"/>
must serve. There was no time for deliberation.
Meldrum might call before the next hour was
spent. So she folded up and sealed her letter
and sent it by a messenger whom she could
trust.</p>

<p>Three days went by, Meldrum pertinaciously
calling every morning and Clare maintaining the
fiction of indisposition. But the pretence could
not be kept up for long, especially as her uncle
knew there was nothing the matter with her.</p>

<p><q>What's the idea, Clare?</q> said he. <q>How
long are you going to keep poor Meldrum kicking
his heels waiting your pleasure? He's bent on
making you his wife. Why don't you say yes and
have done with it? You'll send every girl and
widow mad with envy when your engagement is
announced.</q></p>

<p><q>So you've settled that I <emph>am</emph> to be engaged. I
suppose I'm not allowed to decide for myself?</q>
returned Clare sharply.</p>

<p><q>Of course you are—the trouble is that you
won't decide. The man is continually tackling
me to know what is the matter. I've exhausted
the usual excuse—a slight cold—and I've fallen
back on nerves, and now I look at you, little
girl, I begin to think that I've hit upon your
complaint. What's upset you?</q></p>

<p>Clare's face certainly looked a little drawn,
and the pretty nose was slightly sharper than it
was wont to be.</p>

<p><q>Oh, I'm worried. I don't know what to say
to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum.</q></p>

<p><q>H'm! You might do worse than accept him.
Meldrum's a man who'll go mad over any woman
<pb n="80"/>
he fancies. You'll be able to do exactly what
you like, excepting one thing.</q></p>

<p><q>And what's that?</q> she asked, with sudden
curiosity.</p>

<p><q>Flirt. I can't fancy him as a complaisant
husband. He's passed his life hitherto with his
mind fixed on making money, and he'll spend the
rest of his days in worshipping his wife. Both
occupations want a little imagination and self-de-
ception to make them pleasant, and I fancy the
first is easier than the second,</q> said the doctor,
shrugging his shoulders and running his fingers
through his iron-grey hair.</p>

<p><q>Oh, uncle, what a thing to say! That's the
worst of being a doctor; it's so difficult to keep
secrets from you. Aren't the secrets of men and
women often the stories of their lives?</q></p>

<p><q>That's confoundedly true, though I shouldn't
have expected such wisdom from your pretty lips.
But we're wandering from the point.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm afraid I interrupted your interesting
analysis—or is diagnosis the proper word?—of <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Meldrum's character. Please go on,</q> said Clare
languidly. <q>You were saying he was seeking
marriage as a rival to his god Mammon.</q></p>

<p><q>That isn't quite the way to put it. The
rival he seeks is love. Love and marriage are
not always synonymous.</q></p>

<p><q>So I've heard,</q> returned Clare, yawning
slightly.</p>

<p><q>At the same time I'm inclined to think most
men are satisfied if their wives are clever enough
to make them fancy they <emph>are</emph> the same thing.</q></p>

<p>Clare made no reply. She had been fanning
<pb n="81"/>
herself slowly, and she now half closed the fan
and appeared to be interested in its elaborate
ornamentation.</p>

<p><q>The odd thing is that some of the happiest
marriages are those which don't begin in violent
love. Andrew Meldrum will want understanding.
He's not a demonstrative man, but don't imagine
because he says so little he doesn't feel deeply.
If he's once deceived where he's placed his faith
he'll never forgive. But so long as his suspicions
are not excited he'll be as blind as a bat. He's
given me a hint as to his intentions—but perhaps
he's already told you?</q></p>

<p><q>About retiring from business and returning
to England? Yes.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, that's an inducement for you to marry
him, isn't it?</q></p>

<p>Again Clare was silent, and again her fan ab-
sorbed her attention.</p>

<p><q>No, I don't think it is,</q> at last she said slowly.
<q>I like India. I like the romance—the natural
life where everything's made pleasant for one—
even the climate. Here at Simla it's lovely. No,
I'm not anxious to go back to England. I said
good-bye to all my friends when I left, and I
expect if I went back they'd all be different. I
don't believe in trying to restore old friendships.</q></p>

<p><q>Humph!</q> grunted the doctor. <q>I wish I
knew what you did believe in, Clare—apart from
flirtation. Anyhow, what am I to say when
Meldrum next questions me? I'm almost certain
to see him to-morrow at the club.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, that I'm still suffering from nerves.</q></p>

<p><q>Now you know that's not the answer I want
<pb n="82"/>
to my question. Meldrum was at me about the
marriage settlement the last time I saw him, and
he's certain to return to the subject. Shall I say
you'll write to him definitely, say before the week's
out?</q></p>

<p><q>No—please don't. Give me a fortnight to
think it over.</q></p>

<p><q>You've had three days already. Time enough
one would think, unless——</q></p>

<p><q>Well, unless?</q></p>

<p><q>Unless there's some one else in the field and
you can't decide between the two. I've heard of
such things.</q></p>

<p><q>And so have I. But really I'm not so hesita-
ting as you seem to suppose. Tell <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum
that in a fortnight I will let him know. In the
meantime, uncle dear, don't give me away. I—I
really couldn't stand the strain of an interview
just yet.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well; then you'll have to be my patient
in reality. You must have a tonic. A good dinner
wouldn't hurt you. Pluck up your courage and
come down.</q></p>

<p>But Clare shook her head, and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope,
reading her mood, ceased to persuade her.</p>

<p><q>Who's the other man, I wonder?</q> he mut-
tered, as he sauntered into the dining-room.</p>

<div n="7" type="chapter">
<pb n="83"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="7">VII</num></head>
<head type="main">In the Heart of Delhi</head>

<p>It was the early morning when the palanquins
came within sight of the cantonments on the
Ridge overlooking Delhi. The dusty levels and
the endless fields of the industrious ryot gave place
to large, well-laid out gardens and woodland
slopes. Delhi lay a mile or so to the south, bathed
in the glory of the rising sun, a city of crimson
and white. The three marble domes of the Jama
Masjid or <q>great mosque</q> stood out in cold
stateliness against the morning sky—in their
massiveness a striking contrast to the graceful
minarets of striped white and pink at the corners.
The grim, solid fort of Salim-garh to the east of
the city suggested all that was sinister and merci-
less. The red sandstone walls, the towers, sur-
mounted by kiosks, of the wondrous palace of
Shah Jahan, symbolized an ancient dynasty and
the greatness and magnificence of a past age,
which were now but shadows, albeit in Bahadur
Shah there still reigned a descendant of the old
Moghul kings.</p>

<p>Lazily lapping the base of Fort and Palace the
blue waters of the Jumna flowed, placid, clear, and
sparkling. For centuries the river had served
<pb n="84"/>
as the repository of countless tragic secrets. It
was the last resting place of thousands of Mussul-
men and Hindus massacred in the narrow streets
of the city, or slain in fierce fights outside its walls.
Sorrowing widows, in accordance with their mar-
riage vows, had sought solace beneath its smiling
surface. Faithless wives, dancing-girls, deluded
maidens, had been hurled from the convenient
walls and windows of the Palace. The Jumna's
sinister reputation was such that though the
natives bathed in its limpid waters they never,
knowingly, allowed a drop to pass their lips.</p>

<p>To the left, between the Ridge and the city,
was a mansion of considerable size standing within
its own grounds. This house belonged to Hindu
Rao, a rich Mahratta Chief, and was destined to
figure largely in the memorable siege of 1857. In
1851 Hindu Rao was alive and very popular.
Had not Horsford been anxious to get to Delhi
without any one knowing of his arrival he would
have called on the old gentleman, whom he knew
exceedingly well, and he would have been certain of
a warm welcome. Hindu Rao died in 1854, and
for weeks after his death nothing was talked of
in Delhi but his gorgeous funeral. Amid much
solemnity his corpse, attired in his most magnificent
costume, the arms encircled with jewelled bracelets,
and costly necklaces of pearls and diamonds
descending to the waist, was carried through the
streets of Delhi sitting bolt upright in a chair of
state, just as he was accustomed to appear in life,
to the banks of the Jumna, when the body was
burnt and the ashes thrown into the river.</p>

<p>The bearers of Horsford's palanquin took the
<pb n="85"/>
eastern road from the Ridge leading to the Cash-
meer Gate. To the left was the mansion known
as Metcalfe House and to the right the Flagstaff
Tower, of no particular significance in 1851, but
ordained by fate to be memorable, six years later,
as the place of refuge for the few who escaped
from the city of massacre. Horsford knew Met-
calfe House well enough. He had been to many
of the magnificent receptions given by the Resident
in the great house, built on the site of gloomy
memory, for tradition has it that the building
covers the grave and tomb of the foster father of
the Emperor Akbar, stabbed while at prayers by
his rival Adam Khan.</p>

<p>Soon the Cashmeer Gate with its double arches
was in sight, but before this was reached Horsford
had taken leave of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt. The residence
of her son, the Delhi Bank official, was outside the
city, in the neighbourhood of the beautiful Kudsia
Gardens on the banks of the river, and not far
from Ludlow Castle, where lived <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Commissioner
Fraser, who afterwards was one of the first victims
of the Delhi upheaval in '57.</p>

<p>During the journey Horsford had become great
friends with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt, who, he found, was a
plain-spoken woman of energy and resource. She
had come to India on a visit to her son with the
idea of staying permanently if she thought she
could settle down. But she found the climate
very trying, besides being, as she declared, too old
to change the ways of the West for those of the
East. The multiplicity of servants bewildered
her, and she was not used to being waited on
hand and foot. She told Horsford that she was
<pb n="86"/>
returning to England via Bombay, and her words
started a train of thought in his mind. He had
decided that Jack Folliott's daughter must not
remain in India. He was sure <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt was
a woman to be trusted, and this conviction sug-
gested a way out of the difficulty. He told her
everything. She was immensely interested and
promised to help him.</p>

<p><q>But I'm starting for Bombay within a week of
reaching Delhi and I can't wait. My son has
made all the arrangements for the journey, and
the Bank's agent in Bombay has instructions to
book my passage to England. If you can only
succeed in placing the child in my hands all right—
I'll take care of her—but it must be done at once.</q></p>

<p><q>You're a true friend,</q> said Horsford. <q>But
please don't imagine it's an easy matter you're
undertaking. It may involve you in some em-
barrassment, so I want to make it perfectly clear
what the thing means, and though you've promised
to help me I oughtn't to consider the promise
binding. You must first hear everything, and
then decide.</q></p>

<p>Jack Folliott had well-to-do sisters in England,
one the wife of a retired general once in the com-
pany's service, and the other the wife of an Indian
Commissioner, also retired. Horsford had been
introduced to both ladies on his arrival in India,
fresh from Addiscombe, and while not caring very
much for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> General Brampton, who was inclined
to be pompous and patronising, he liked the
Commissioner's wife, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Spicer. She was very
kind and sympathetic and made young Guy
Horsford, then a lad of eighteen, exceedingly
<pb n="87"/>
welcome, because of his being the chum of their
favourite brother. Both the General and the
Commissioner retired on their liberal pensions soon
after Guy Horsford obtained his lieutenancy, and
neither they nor their wives knew anything of
Captain Folliott's attachment to a native girl.
Horsford's plan was to despatch Nara to the keep-
ing of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Spicer—he had more faith in her than
in her sister—and trust to fate for the rest.</p>

<p><q>Part of my duty, then, is to hand the child
over to her aunts,</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt. <q>So far
I see no embarrassment. You'll write to them
beforehand, of course?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, the mail goes out to-morrow. My letter
will reach <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Spicer about a fortnight before
you—that is if you start from Bombay directly
you arrive there. As you say, no embarrassment
is likely to arise, it's the preliminaries about the
deportment of Eurasians that may be a little
troublesome. I don't know whether the old
regulations are in force. I shall have to inquire.
Anyway, it's only a matter of money.</q></p>

<p>Horsford was thinking of the objection the East
India Company had in the old days to the trans-
mission of native orphans to England. The direc-
tors had very decided notions on the sex question,
and rather than encourage marriage with native
women they were prepared to wink at what in
England would be called <q>questionable relations.</q>
The Company appeared to regard itself as called
upon, under certain circumstances, to act <foreign xml:lang="la">in loco
parentis</foreign>, and no native of India was allowed to
be taken as a passenger on board any vessel pro-
ceeding to England without a deposit of 500 rupees,
<pb n="88"/>
or security to that amount, <q>lest the party should
become a burden to the Company.</q> Captains of
Indiamen did not care to take children, whether
native or English, as passengers, and few were
willing to do so for less than 800 rupees, and even
then some attendant must be provided, whose
passage would probably amount to as much more.
Horsford therefore was quite aware he was in-
curring a considerable pecuniary liability in what
he was doing. He explained all this to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Mowatt.</p>

<p><q>The question of the ayah,</q> he continued,
<q>presents no difficulty. Azeena would give her
life for the girl, and though I expect a little oppo-
sition when she learns that she'll have to cross the
<soCalled>black water,</soCalled></q>—most native women are horribly
afraid of the sea—<q>I'm sure her love for Nara will
carry everything before it. You know what Azeena
is by this time and you tell me you don't dislike
her.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, well,</q> said blunt <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt, <q>I think
she's about the best of all the native servants I've
had to do with. In England, you know, I wouldn't
put up with one of them for a minute. What I
don't like is they can be frightfully rude without
saying a word. Azeena seems a faithful, docile
creature and better than the rest—better, anyway,
than those Portuguese ayahs. I've come across
one or two specimens, horrid, stuck-up creatures
I wouldn't give house-room to. I'm told the
Portuguese ayahs are becoming fewer and fewer,
and a good thing too, I should say. But what
about Azeena in the meantime? Is she to come
with me?</q></p>

<pb n="89"/>
<p><q>I think she'd better go to her people. Her
father's a very old man—a dealer in grain or some-
thing of that kind. Keeps a store in a dirty lane
just off the Chandi Chauk. I may want her assis-
tance at any moment and she ought to be handy.
Besides, things may happen—I can't say what—
and I don't want to compromise you in any way.</q></p>

<p><q>You talk, Captain Horsford, as if there was
danger. Hadn't you better think twice before
you go further in the matter? It's too romantic
to be safe. One never knows where romance
ends. It's not like business; you can stop a specu-
lation when things are going wrong, and you can
generally see a bit ahead. But with romance—or
love—no.</q></p>

<p>Horsford was not disposed to dispute the truth
of this. It had been so in Jack Folliott's case,
it was likely to be so in the enterprise in which
he had been so suddenly plunged. But if one
could see the end of a romance, romance would
cease to exist. The unknown was its charm.</p>

<p><q>There's no going back,</q> said he. <q>I've already
sacrificed something, and to stop because there
might be danger would be cowardly.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, that's nonsense,</q> retorted <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt.
<q>I always say there are two sorts of fools—those
who are never anything else but foolish, and those
who are fools by accident and continue to be so
through obstinacy.</q></p>

<p><q>And the second are more troublesome and
dangerous than the first, I guess. My dear lady,
there's something more than foolishness in what
I'm doing. I should never forgive myself if I
failed in my oath, now that I've the chance of
<pb n="90"/>
carrying it out. If there's danger all the more
reason why I should face it.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt twisted her wedding ring and a
tender, thoughtful look crept into her eyes. Her
memory had gone back five-and-twenty years to
the wreck of the East Indiaman <name type="vessel" rend="i">Cornwallis</name>, of which
Captain Henry Mowatt was the master. She had
kepi the newspaper records of the time eulogising
the heroism of her husband, who had gone down
with his ship rather than jump into the boat
already weighted down to the water's edge and
so imperil the lives of others. Was there business
in this bravery? Did it not belong to romance?
Some might even say that it was foolish.</p>

<p><q>You're right, Captain Horsford, and I'm
wrong,</q> said she in a soft, almost humble tone.
<q>Don't say any more but reckon upon me to help
you all I can.</q></p>

<p>She put out her hand between the curtains of
the palanquin—the talk had taken place while the
men were resting—Horsford grasped it warmly.
He felt that if Nara were with this kindly woman
she would be safe.</p>

<p>They parted, and Horsford, telling Azeena
he would call at her father's shop after nightfall
and give her further instructions, proceeded to-
wards the Cashmeer Gate.</p>

<p>At the Cashmeer Gate Horsford discharged the
palanquin runners and entered the city on foot,
passing through the lofty archway of the Gate,
leaving <abbr>St.</abbr> James' Church to the right, its common-
place architecture contrasting, to its detriment,
with that of the majestic Jama Masjid, dazzling
in the sun now fully risen. The founder of the
<pb n="91"/>
English Church was Colonel Skinner, in whose
veins, as well as in those of his wife, ran Indian
blood. East and West must have warred at times
within the old soldier's heart, and maybe he was
trying to reconcile the two forces when, not con-
tented with paying tribute to the Christian half
of his nature, he built a mosque out of regard for
the other half.</p>

<p>After crossing the Delhi canal Horsford entered
the Chandi Chauk, or Street of Silver, the main
artery of the city, running from the King's Palace
on the east to the Lahore Gate on the west. The
day's business had just begun, and he had some
difficulty in pushing his way through the motley
and, in many respects, repulsive crowd. The
street, bordered by private houses, intermingled
with shops in all the picturesqueness and variety
of the East, was crammed with merchandise and
buyers and sellers. Here and there it was blocked
up by bags of grain, bales of cotton stuff, native
and foreign, the obstructions further added to by
carts loaded and empty, tethered oxen, and country
produce of various kinds piled in front of the shops
while itinerant merchants, mingled with lepers
and beggars, strove to out-yell each other.</p>

<p>The equipages were confusing in their incongru-
ity. Carriages of English origin, but altered to
suit the requirements of the East, rolled by;
elephants and camels lumbered along; palanquins
and bullock carts and strange shaped conveyances
from remote country districts jostled each other
in the never ending line of traffic. <choice><corr>Cheetahs</corr><orig>Chetahs</orig></choice> and
hunting leopards were being led for exercise or
for sale, and tall, athletic men from Cashmeer
<pb n="92"/>
slowly sauntered by, on the lookout for purchasers
of the Persian cats under their arms and the Persian
greyhounds following at their heels.</p>

<p>The houses were wonderfully varied and the
architecture decidedly mixed. Grecian piazzas,
porticoes, and pediments were joined to houses
originally of Moslem or Hindu construction;
signs were hanging from some of the shops, and
the striped <foreign xml:lang="hi">pundahs</foreign> or curtains, which supplied
the place of doors in many cases, and the variegated,
highly coloured screens shading the shop windows,
added to the life and animation of this wonderful
street. For the most part the houses were white-
washed, and the carpets and shawls, the strips of
cloth of every hue, the scarves and coloured veils,
the <foreign xml:lang="hi">saris</foreign> and other drapery hung out over the
verandahs or on the tops of the houses to purify
in the sun, imparted a colour and an aspect of
gaiety altogether unknown in any European capital.</p>

<p>But whatever pleasure there was to the eye
was counterbalanced by the drawbacks peculiar
to the city, more pronounced sixty years ago than
they are to-day. Now and again came whiffs
of noisome smells suggesting a visitation of the
much dreaded <soCalled>Delhi boil</soCalled>; the air was full of
clouds of irritating, stinging flies; the scorching
sun blistered the face, and the swarms of filthy
mendicants, fakirs, and nondescripts in rags and
dirt made one shudder.</p>

<p>Horsford paid little attention to the tears and
anguish of the beggars who beset him, and their
appeals on behalf of their starving families, and
elbowed his way to the Delhi bank. He had two
objects in calling at the bank—one was to report
<pb n="93"/>
to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mowatt the arrival of his mother, and the
second to make known to him what <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt
had promised to do, and to make arrangements
for securing sufficient funds to defray the neces-
sary expenses.</p>

<p>He did not tell Mowatt more than he had told
the lady, if indeed as much, and the risk and
danger he was about to incur he kept to himself.
The financial arrangement with the bank con-
cluded satisfactorily, the next step was to write a
letter to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Spicer—a somewhat difficult and
delicate business. He discovered that the mail
was going out that afternoon, and as the letter
would want some thinking over Mowatt offered
him the use of his private office, an offer which
Horsford was glad to accept. He did not for the
present care to go to his bungalow near the canton-
ments, north of the city, as, until he had accom-
plished the object on which he had set his heart,
he preferred not meeting any of his brother officers.</p>

<p>Before he was half through the letter he decided
to address it to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton. The General's
wife was Jack Folliott's eldest sister. She liked
to rule, and it occurred to him that she would
consider herself slighted if she were not the first
to be consulted.</p>

<p><q>I expect she won't like the girl being suddenly
planted upon her, but what's to be done? After
all, both the women were devoted to poor Jack, and
for his sake they'll be drawn to the child. But—
that confounded marriage tie! There's the stum-
bling-block. Poor Nara's royal blood won't go for
much in the absence of the parson's formula. I
mustn't let out the truth. The women must think
<pb n="94"/>
what they like. Think what they like—indeed,
by Jove! they'd think a lot if they knew she'd been
a dancing-girl.</q></p>

<p>Guy threw down his pen in despair. Suppose
his contemplated escapade got wind? Suppose it
ended in disastrous failure? Suppose the sharp
swords of the Rajah's warriors put an end to the
whole business, himself included? Suppose——</p>

<p><q>Bah! you idiot,</q> he muttered fiercely, <q>don't
meet troubles half-way. You've got to do the
thing, and you'd better take your tip from the
hunting field. When you've got an ugly jump
throw your heart over first, and your horse will
follow, old Squire Merry used to tell me when
I was a youngster. I'll fancy I'm a Hindu, that
I've consulted the astrologer, and that the omens
are favourable.</q></p>

<p>At last the letter was finished, sealed, and des-
patched, and once more Horsford was in the noise
and turmoil of the Chandi Chauk. He went in
the direction of the Lahore Gate, turned into a
narrow, ill-smelling lane, and ploughed his way
through the black mud and refuse. Never did
Delhi seem to him more a city of violent contrasts
than at that moment; he had but to lift his eyes
from the offal of the roadway, the ragged, evil-
looking swarms of <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign> and the squalid
shops, to see towering in front of him the majestic
Jama Masjid, rosy red and dazzling white in the
blazing sun.</p>

<p>Suspicious eyes glanced at the stalwart English-
man as he strode along. The sight was an unusual
one in that low quarter of the town, but no one
attempted to molest him. He stopped at a low-
<pb n="95"/>
pitched shop, its entire breadth and height open
to the street. Bags of grain loaded the floor, and
in the narrow passage way between two stacks was
Kulloo Bux, Azeena's father, chaffering with a
customer. Kulloo Bux was a man over sixty,
grey-headed, grey-bearded, and wearing enormous
goggles. He and his customer were shouting at
the top of their voices, and by their gesticulations
one would think they were about to fly at each
other's throats. In reality they were the best of
friends. The apparent quarrel was only the usual
Eastern preliminary to a bargain.</p>

<p>Azeena had warned her father that the Sahib
was coming. Kulloo Bux salaamed low, and
apologising profusely for his humble dwelling,
begged his lordship to condescend to honour him
by entering, at the same time raising a curtain
which divided the front of the shop from the back.
Horsford obeyed and heard the swish of drapery
as he stepped into the dark interior. He knew
what the flutter meant. The womenfolk of the
household had hurried out of sight. They rarely
show themselves to Europeans in their own dwell-
ings.</p>

<p>The place smelt horribly close and the air was not
improved by being flavoured with garlic from some
mess in a cooking-pot on a charcoal stove. The
visitor was not sorry when the voices outside the
curtain suddenly dropped, and the clinking of
money indicated that the deal was completed.
Soon after Kulloo Bux appeared, more apologetic
than ever.</p>

<p>Horsford knew all about Kulloo Bux. The
grain dealer, some ten years previous, had been a
<pb n="96"/>
<foreign xml:lang="hi">chokadar</foreign> in the service of the colonel of the regi-
ment to which both Jack Folliott and Guy Hors-
ford belonged, and bore an excellent character.</p>

<p><q>Azeena has told you what has brought her
home?</q> asked Horsford.</p>

<p><q>Yes, yes, my lord. The coming of my daughter
has been to mine eyes as the rain after a drought.
Seven years have gone since she left my roof. I
thought her dead and the child too. The omens
were bad—they have never been otherwise. The
astrologer who cast the mother's nativity foretold
woe. He was right. The Sahib Folliott was
killed, and she took her own life. And the child
—ah, the child!</q></p>

<p><q>Well, did he prophesy the truth about her?</q>
asked Horsford ironically. <q>If he did he must
have been an uncommonly clever old boy, con-
sidering she wasn't born at the time he cast the
mother's horoscope.</q></p>

<p><q>The Sahib does not know the wisdom Allah
has conferred on the astrologer,</q> cried the old
man excitedly.</p>

<p><q>Perhaps not. It doesn't matter. I've come
to talk about other things. We'll let the astrologer
alone for the present.</q></p>

<p>The two fell into an earnest conversation.
Horsford had formulated his plans, which he laid
before Kulloo Bux. They frightened the old man.
If they failed it meant that he would lose his life,
though the Sahib might escape.</p>

<p><q>I swear to you, Kulloo Bux, by your own Allah,
that you shall run no risk that I don't share. I
don't ask you to do anything but take me, a
respectable Mahajan (money-lender), as your
<pb n="97"/>
passenger in your cart. Azeena will travel with
you, and if it chances that a fourth passenger in
the way of a child joins us, why, where's the
harm?</q></p>

<p>In the way Guy Horsford put the case it sounded
innocent enough, but the old grain dealer was
not satisfied. He wanted to know where the
child was coming from, and how she was to be
obtained. The people who had her might be
more powerful than the Sahib. If the Sahib were
overcome, what would happen to poor Kulloo
Bux? He represented that Zeenut Mehal showed
no mercy when she was enraged, and there were
ways of punishing offending persons not dreamed
of by the Sahib. The walls of the King's Palace
were thick, and it was full of secret passages,
secret chambers, and what not, where deeds of
vengeance could be enacted and no one outside
be the wiser.</p>

<p><q>I know what you mean—the slicing of eyes as
though they were lemons—thrusting a bag of hot
ashes over one's head and patting the back to
make the victim take a good sniff—etc., etc.
I've heard of these diabolical ingenuities. Don't
you be afraid, Kulloo Bux. I'll see that our
people look after you. As for the Sahib being
overcome, that's all moonshine. It's not the
Sahib's way. And see—you'll put money in your
pocket. You'll not need to sell a single bag of
grain for a whole year.</q></p>

<p>The last argument was all powerful. Half an
hour afterwards Kulloo Bux left his shop and
strolled leisurely down the lane towards the Chandi
Chauk, gossiping to his neighbours as he went,
<pb n="98"/>
and giving out he was going to call upon his nephew,
who was a <foreign xml:lang="hi">khidmutgar</foreign> in the service of a Sahib-
logue at the cantonments. But when Kulloo
Bux reached the Chandi Chauk he turned to the
east and passed through the gate leading to the
network of lanes round the Palace. This was
certainly not the way to the cantonments.</p>

<p>The day wore on. The sweltering heat passed,
and with the approach of darkness came the cold-
ness of the Indian night.</p>

<p>A clean-shaven man with stooping shoulders,
limping feebly with the assistance of a staff, and
looking like a respectable native, issued from
the house of Kulloo Bux and, like Kulloo Bux,
took the road to the King's Palace. Following
him also from the grain dealer's house came a
woman. They both made their way to the bridge
of boats crossing the Jumna from the Calcutta
gate, and until they reached the other side of the
river the two did not draw near each other.</p>

<p>It was a moonless night, but the stars gave
sufficient light to show the river flowing smoothly
and as noiseless as oil. The fields stretching away
to the east, the north, and the south were vast,
unbroken, black expanses. To the west the white
marble domes of the Jama Masjid were alone
visible.</p>

<p>The respectable man with the limp waited for
the woman to join him.</p>

<p><q>All right up till now, Azeena,</q> he whispered.
<q>Do you know the spot where your father promised
to meet us?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, Sahib, by the well outside the village.
We must walk a mile.</q></p>

<pb n="99"/>
<p><q>Good; that's nothing, so long as we're not
disappointed when we get there.</q></p>

<p><q>My father is an honourable man, Sahib. He
keeps his word. Everybody knows that,</q> pro-
tested Azeena.</p>

<p><q>I don't doubt it, and I daresay he'll get the
cart, but he may have some difficulty in hiring a
pony, but we must hope for the best. Let's push
on.</q></p>

<p>Guy Horsford, the respectable native, did not
consider it necessary to be lame now that he was
outside Delhi, and he followed Azeena, who,
leaving the main road, struck across a sandy
patch and entered upon a path leading to corn
fields; beyond was the village, as Horsford could
tell by the barking of dogs. In due time they
reached the well, but there was no cart, no pony,
no Kulloo Bux.</p>

<p><q>What did I say, Azeena!</q> exclaimed Horsford,
angrily. <q>Has that father of yours gone off with
the money I gave him?</q></p>

<p><q>No, no, Sahib. He would not do such a wicked
thing. He has never robbed any one in his life.</q></p>

<p><q>I hope he hasn't, but, seeing he had at least
six hours' start of us, it's strange he's not done
what he promised. Anyhow, he ought to be here
to tell us why he's failed.</q></p>

<p>Azeena could say nothing but repeat her protest
that her father was an honourable man. Horsford
paid no attention, but paced about impatiently,
and strained his eyes into the darkness. Suddenly
Azeena ran to him.</p>

<p><q>He is coming,</q> she cried excitedly. <q>I hear
cart wheels.</q></p>

<pb n="100"/>
<p>The ayah was right. In a minute or so Horsford
heard creaking also, and he advanced cautiously
to meet the coming vehicle. It proved to be an
ordinary covered cart, drawn by a pony, somewhat
ungainly, but strong. Walking at the pony's head
was Kulloo Bux. The grain dealer was beginning,
after his usual manner, to apologise, but Horsford
stopped him.</p>

<p><q>It's all right now you're here. What about
the pony? Can he go? He won't have a fit of
kicking or biting, will he?</q></p>

<p><q>I warrant him, Sahib. Hiring the pony was
the delay. A Melá (a fair) begins to-morrow ten
miles away on the banks of the river and every-
body has gone. Only the old people are left in
the village. I could find no horses or ponies, and
I had to walk five miles to the house of the zemindar.
I had to pay him more than I told you, but the
pony is worth the money.</q></p>

<p>Horsford shrugged his shoulders. He attributed
the excuse to the desire of Kulloo Bux to put a
little more coin in his pocket. The news about
the fair was not displeasing. It would clear the
road of beggars, <foreign xml:lang="hi">fakirs</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="hi">goojurs</foreign>, who are always
sure of a harvest of some kind at fairs and festivals.</p>

<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="8">VIII</num></head>
<head type="main">Sundra Bai, the <soCalled>Begum</soCalled></head>

<p>Soon they were jolting on their way. Kulloo
Bux had not overpraised the pony. It had occa-
sional spells of obstinacy, but on the whole it
behaved itself fairly well. During the journey
Horsford anxiously questioned Azeena about Nara's
history. He learned that when the news of Jack
Folliott's death reached the girl's mother all the
traditions of centuries were roused. The young
mother was not a Hindu, but she felt, as Hindu
widows do, that, bereft of their husbands, life for
them had come to an end. Suttee it was true had
been abolished, but the penance custom and religion
imposed upon the poor widow was almost worse
than death. She begged Azeena to take care of
the child, warning her that Nara's Mahommedan
relatives were her enemies, because of her mother's
love for an infidel, and the next morning the poor
woman's body was found floating in the Jumna.</p>

<p>The warning as to Nara was not unnecessary,
for within a month ayah and charge were borne
away by armed men, and the ayah threatened
with death if she betrayed them to any of Sahib
Folliott's friends. Nara's relatives were very
wicked, said Azeena, and sold her to an infamous
old woman who, in partnership with Hoosein Khan,
<pb n="102"/>
owned the troupe of dancing-girls. They would
have separated the child from her only friend, but
Nara, with a spirit beyond her years, frantically
declared that if they did so she would kill herself.</p>

<p><q>And Nara would have kept her word, Sahib,</q>
whispered the woman. <q>She does not know
what fear is. If her spirit could have been broken
that would have happened long, long ago. The
other girls hate her, and many a time has the vile
woman Sundra Bai, the <soCalled>Begum,</soCalled> as she likes
to be called, savagely beaten her. The <soCalled>Begum</soCalled>
was a famous dancer when she was young, and was
a favourite of Shah Alum.</q></p>

<p><q>The deuce she was,</q> growled Horsford. <q>Then
I'll bet she learned something.</q></p>

<p><q>I have heard tales—horribly wicked tales of
poisonings, of lingering deaths, of terrible torturings
in those days in the Palace. I cannot speak of
them to you, Sahib.</q></p>

<p>Azeena shuddered and buried her face in her
hands. Horsford understood her. He had also
heard grim stories of the Palace when Shah Alum
was king, stories with which was associated all that
was debased and brutal in human nature.</p>

<p><q>The <soCalled>Begum</soCalled> has been useful many a time
to Zeenut Mehal,</q> went on Azeena in a hushed
voice. <q>She can compound secret poisons. She
can mingle death with the scent of the roses.
She can make the most delicious sweetmeats that
are sweet and refreshing in the mouth and bring
on horrible diseases after they are swallowed,
diseases that are incurable, diseases that end in
raving madness!</q></p>

<p>Azeena went on to dilate upon Sundra Bai's craft
<pb n="103"/>
and wickedness until Horsford's blood boiled. Had
he any doubt that he was not justified in rescuing
Nara from the clutches of the terrible old woman
and her infamous associate Hoosein Khan, what he
had learned that night would have decided him.</p>

<p><q>Yes, the <soCalled>Begum</soCalled> is a wicked woman, but not
so wicked as Hoosein Khan—may dogs defile his
grave! May he be accursed for ever! May——</q></p>

<p>Rage choked the woman's voice. Her sudden
burst of anger sent her body quivering. Some
terrible recollection had come into her mind at the
mention of Hoosein Khan.</p>

<p><q>He is the vilest of wretches. He would have
strangled me because I protected poor Nara from
his hideous, his loathsome persecution, but for
Sundra Bai. But, Sahib, it was not for love or
pity that the <soCalled>Begum</soCalled> stayed his hand. All she
loves is money. No one could play the <foreign xml:lang="hi">saringhee</foreign>
as I played it. She asked higher prices because of
me. The <foreign xml:lang="hi">tuwaifs</foreign> are hers. Hoosein Khan has no
power. He only pretends he has. The <soCalled>Begum</soCalled>
takes the money and gives him a small share.
She hates Nara, but the girl is too valuable to be
let come to harm. Zeenut Mehal knows all about
Nara; that is why she is willing to pay a high price
for her. For a common <foreign xml:lang="hi">tuwaif</foreign> she would give
but a paltry sum. They can be had by the dozen.
But Nara—you saw her dance, Sahib. Did you
ever see one so graceful, so enchanting? Ah! she
knows all the arts. The <soCalled>Begum</soCalled> taught her.</q></p>

<p>Azeena's words made Horsford the more deter-
mined to carry out his designs, whatever might be
the consequences. It was clear for what purpose
the child had been so carefully trained, and he
<pb n="104"/>
growled out his opinion of the infamy of the thing
in good plain Saxon, expressive enough to Azeena
so far as sounds went, but otherwise unintelligible.</p>

<p>Morning broke, and Kulloo Bux made a halt for
breakfast at the usual resting place for travellers—
a well. By this time fifteen miles had been covered.
Meanwhile no conveyance coming towards Delhi
had been encountered. All were going the other
way: to the Melá. Close by their halting place
were cross-roads, east and west, and that to the
west was thronged with foot passengers, with
horsemen, with all kinds of vehicles. The rich were
as eager as the poor to take part in the gaiety, and
these were mounted on elephants and camels. All
the women were dressed in their best and decked
with ornaments. Some, even, were unveiled, for
at Melás a certain amount of freedom is allowed.</p>

<p>Horsford would have continued the journey
after the meal, but Kulloo Bux urged that the
pony needed rest. Horsford did not contest the
point. He was quite aware of the importance of
not over-working the animal. Resuming his limp
and his staff, he strolled along the road, with
plenty to occupy his attention in the motley
gathering that streamed past him.</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile or so from where he had
left Azeena and her father he came upon a party
encamped in the shade of a mango grove. Four
<foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlees</foreign>—large, heavy, tilted, two-wheeled carts—
had their yokes propped up by struts to keep the
bodies of the vehicles level, and from behind the
drawn curtains of three of the vehicles came
the laughter and chatter of women. The fourth
<foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign> was loaded with luggage, and a dozen oxen
<pb n="105"/>
were doing their best to feed on whatever green
stuff they could find within the length of their
tethers. A score or so of men were squatting
round a savoury and substantial meal—a large
dish of appetising <foreign xml:lang="hi">kabobs</foreign>—lumps of meat stuck
on a skewer and roasted. Most of the men were
native soldiers in the service of some prince or
chief. Their spears and swords and shields were
on the ground near one of the <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlees</foreign>.</p>

<p>Slackening his pace to a crawl, Horsford limped
by on purpose to inspect them closely, and to
listen to what they were saying. A rather excited
discussion was going on. The majority of the men
wanted to visit the Melá, two or three were doubt-
ful. There broke in upon the confused talk a
shrill, querulous voice from a man whom Horsford
had not hitherto seen, hidden as he had been
behind the burly forms of a couple of the warriors.
The owner of the voice bent forward with vehement
gesticulation, and Horsford recognised the yellow,
wrinkled face, the ragged, grey beard and gleaming,
avaricious eyes of Hoosein Khan. He was vio-
lently protesting against the proposed delay.</p>

<p><q>Are you not paid to guard us until the girl is
safe in the King's Palace?</q> he asked. <q>If you go
to the Melá, you will spend your money and waste
your time, and who will suffer for the delay? Not
you, but I, Hoosein Khan. What say you, Nur
Singh? You are responsible for your men. Do
you command them or do they command you?</q></p>

<p>The leader apparently had not given his opinion.
He made it known now. He had taken a fancy
to one of the dancing-girls, and had promised her a
treat at the fair. Nur Singh having spoken to this
<pb n="106"/>
effect, some of his men followed suit and the truth
came out. The girls had set their hearts on taking
part in the gaiety of the Melá, and the warriors
had pledged themselves to gratify their wishes.
Hoosein Khan lifted up his hands and his voice in
bitter protest. In vain he cried out that he would
be ruined; that some of the girls might never
return—that Melás were full of dangers and at-
tended by <foreign xml:lang="hi">goojurs</foreign> and all kinds of bad characters—
and in any case if he failed in his mission to Delhi
it might be as much as his life was worth.</p>

<p><q>What can hurt you by delay? Who is the
enemy you fear?</q> asked the leader.</p>

<p><q>I have told you—the Sahib who covets the pet
lamb of the flock,</q> screamed Hoosein Khan wildly.</p>

<p><q>One man—and he now at Simla,</q> rejoined the
warrior contemptuously.</p>

<p><q>How know you that? You have not fought the
Feringhee. He has not the craft of our race, but he
never lets go his hold. His Highness the Rajah may
try and deceive the Sahib, but he will not succeed.</q></p>

<p>Hoosein Khan's arguments failed to shake the
determination of the leader. He thought of
Adala's melting eyes, and of her anger if he dis-
appointed her. However, he was willing to com-
promise the matter. He offered to leave three of
the most redoubtable of his warriors behind, and
with this Hoosein Khan was forced to be content.
But when he saw Nur Singh picked out the three
oldest—men whose youthful fire had departed,
and who had not attracted the admiration of any
of the <foreign xml:lang="ar">houris</foreign> within the <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlees</foreign>—his discontent
rose afresh. Nur Singh, enraged at the aspersions
cast on his soldiers by a man of low origin, who
<pb n="107"/>
had never in his life faced an enemy, settled the
matter by bringing the flat of his sword smartly
on Hoosein Khan's back, and the discontented
one groaningly submitted.</p>

<p>The discussion had been so excited, and the
men had been so absorbed by thoughts of the Melá,
that they paid no attention to the lame man with
the staff. Unobserved, Horsford took up a position
some little distance within the grove, and watched
the preparations for departure. The luggage <foreign xml:lang="hi">bah-
lee</foreign> and one other was left behind, and the gay
party set out in the remaining carts, leaving
Hoosein Khan glum and angry, and the three old
soldiers squatting in the shade, gravely smoking.</p>

<p>Horsford crept away to formulate his plans.
Kulloo Bux was asleep, and Azeena, seated in the
cart, her head bent and her body swaying, was
crooning the wild, plaintive melody Horsford had
heard her play on the <foreign xml:lang="hi">saringhee</foreign>.</p>

<p><q>Azeena—Azeena, she's found!</q> whispered
Horsford. <q>We needn't go a step further.</q></p>

<p><q>Is my lord jesting with his servant?</q> cried
the ayah, trembling.</p>

<p><q>Not he. It's true enough. Most of the
soldiers have gone to the Melá with the girls.
Nara and Hoosein Khan and three of the men
have been left behind.</q></p>

<p><q>And Sundra Bai?</q> asked Azeena anxiously.</p>

<p><q>I know nothing about her. Perhaps she's
gone to the Melá too.</q></p>

<p>Azeena shook her head.</p>

<p><q>She would not leave Nara. It is she who de-
cides everything. Hoosein Khan has to do what
he is told. He has to give her every rupee he gets
<pb n="108"/>
for the dancing, and she pays him out of it. Old
as she is, Sundra Bai is as strong and fierce as a
tiger, but Hoosein Khan—no. He is a coward;
he has the heart of a rabbit. You must be wary,
Sahib. The <soCalled>Begum</soCalled> is crafty.</q></p>

<p><q>Thanks for the warning, Azeena. When we start
operations, I'll make sure of the old cat first.</q></p>

<p><q>What will you do, Sahib? Shall I wake my
father?</q></p>

<p><q>No. Let him sleep on and you do the same.
We shall want all our strength, but nothing can
be done until night.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, Sahib, I shall not sleep now that I know
my dearest is near,</q> cried the woman excitedly.
<q>I long to see her—to fold my arms about her.</q></p>

<p><q>You shall do that in good time, but you must
be patient.</q></p>

<p><q>I will try, Sahib, I will try.</q></p>

<p>Azeena twined her long, thin, brown hands to-
gether in the effort to control her emotion and
broke into her favourite melody, but singing it so
softly it was little more than a whisper.</p>

<p>Horsford himself followed the advice he had
given Azeena; he went to sleep until the after-
noon was well advanced. He found Kulloo Bux
drawing water from the well. Azeena had told
her father everything, so that the two had no-
thing to do but to arrange their plans.</p>

<p>Night drew on apace. At dusk Kulloo Bux,
taking advantage of the hideous noise made by a
gang of gipsies thumping tom-toms and half
jabbering, half yelling, their wild songs, cautiously
shifted his cart close to the mango grove, and not
a dozen yards from Sundra Bai's <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign>.</p>

<pb n="109"/>
<p>Half an hour after the gipsies had passed the
road was quiet, and the only sound that broke
the stillness was an occasional bellow from one
of the tethered oxen. Horsford crept forward to
reconnoitre, but in the blackness beneath the
mangoes hardly anything was visible. However,
he made out the <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign>, thanks to its white tilt,
and crawling past could just discern the crouching
form of Hoosein Khan squatting on the yoke and
puffing solemnly at his hookah. The three soldiers
could not be seen, and remembering that there
was a <foreign xml:lang="hi">serai</foreign> or inn not far from the entrance to the
grove, and thinking it was most likely the men had
gone there, Horsford went towards the place.</p>

<p>The <foreign xml:lang="hi">serai</foreign>, instead of being a scene of confusion,
as native inns usually were, was comparatively
dull. Everybody was gone to the Melá, and two
of the women innkeepers, either on account of the
dullness of trade, or because they were debarred
from tasting the delights of the fair, were quarrel-
ling and abusing each other's relatives for several
generations back. The three warriors, evidently
glad of the break in the monotony, were watching
the quarrel with much interest. Horsford saw
that they were absorbed, and he hastened back to
the <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign>. He cannoned against some one in the
darkness. It was Azeena.</p>

<p><q>Sahib—Sahib,</q> she whispered excitedly,
<q>Sundra Bai is in the cart. She——</q></p>

<p>Azeena stopped abruptly, and her finger went to
her lips. Hoosein Khan's rasping voice was heard.</p>

<p><q>Who's there? Is it thou, Devendra Doshi?</q></p>

<p>The old man's eyes, accustomed to the darkness,
had apparently discovered the two moving forms.</p>

<pb n="110"/>
<p><q>Azeena,</q> Horsford said under his breath,
<q>be ready to do what I told you.</q></p>

<p>The ayah nodded. Her eyes were dilating and
gleaming like those of a cat. Horsford limped
towards Hoosein Khan, who had slipped from his
seat on the yoke and was peering into the darkness.</p>

<p><q>Brother, am I on the right road to the Melá?</q>
said the supposed lame man.</p>

<p><q>I know nothing about the Melá,</q> snarled
Hoosein Khan. <q>I——</q></p>

<p>His words were cut short as though by a knife.
A pair of long, sinewy hands, holding between them
a silk scarf stretched tightly, had descended over the
man's head. The hands were Azeena's. Horsford
had told her to gag Hoosein Khan. At the same
moment Horsford grasped the old man's wrists, and
in a twinkling bound them together with the cord he
had in readiness. He did not trouble about Azeena's
proceedings, he was sure she would do her work
effectually. He did not expect Hoosein Khan would
yield without a struggle, but beyond a slight con-
vulsive writhing there was no movement, save a
bending of his body backwards, probably due to
the force with which Azeena had drawn the scarf.</p>

<p><q>Is the knot secured?</q> whispered Horsford.</p>

<p><q>Yes, Sahib,</q> came huskily over the old man's
shoulder.</p>

<p>Horsford laid the old man gently on the ground,
and was about to raise himself from his stooping
position, satisfied that Hoosein Khan, effectually
gagged, could not interfere with the next opera-
tion, when he saw there was no handkerchief over
the mouth. The lips were swollen and parted.
The eyes were open.</p>

<pb n="111"/>
<p><q>My God, she's strangled him!</q> he muttered.</p>

<p>Azeena was standing where she had let go the
body. The handkerchief was lying at her feet.
She was covering her eyes with her hands. Hors-
ford was by her side in an instant.</p>

<p><q>What made you do it?</q> he demanded
sternly.</p>

<p><q>It had to be done, Sahib, it had to be,</q> he
heard her gasp out. <q>It was so easy. Hoosein
Khan himself taught me. The vile wretch was a
Thug when he was a young man. He has strangled
many and many a traveller going to Melás on this
very road. He boasted of it. He deserved death.
Remember what I told you of his wickedness.</q></p>

<p>Horsford did not doubt Azeena's word. At the
same time it was not pleasant to be associated
with such a deed. But it was not a moment for
scruples. There was other work to be done.</p>

<p><q>Go round to the back of the <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign> and be
ready to take the child. You know what to do.
Hurry her into the cart and tell your father to
drive his hardest to Delhi.</q></p>

<p><q>And you, Sahib?</q></p>

<p><q>If all goes well I may have time to join you.
If not—well, I can look after myself.</q></p>

<p>Azeena, without a word, obeyed, and Horsford
mounted the projecting ledge in front of the
<foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign>. He looked into the interior through the
slit of the curtains beneath the tilt. The old
woman was lying huddled on soft cushions near
the place for the driver. Nara was by her side in
the corner. To get the girl to the back of the
<foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign> she would have to be lifted over the woman.
The latter was in a heavy sleep, as was evident by
<pb n="112"/>
her discordant snuffles, and there was just the
chance she would not wake. Horsford put his
head close to the girl's ear.</p>

<p><q>Nara,</q> he whispered.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes almost immediately.</p>

<p><q>You know me, don't you? Do you remember
—at the Rajah's Palace? You fainted, and I
carried you to the verandah. I have come to take
you from these wicked people. Azeena is waiting
for you outside. You're quite safe if you keep
quiet and do what I tell you.</q></p>

<p>Long before he said these words Nara recognised
him. A smile lit her eyes, and she put out her
hand to greet him.</p>

<p><q>Get up,</q> he went on, <q>but mind you don't
touch the Begum and wake her.</q></p>

<p>The girl raised her slim form, and gathering up
the folds of her <foreign xml:lang="hi">sari</foreign> lest it might touch the woman's
face, she stepped lightly from the huddled form by
her side, Horsford meanwhile keeping himself ready
to seize the Begum and stifle any cry she might raise.</p>

<p>Nara accomplished her task successfully, but at
the very moment she was jumping from the back of
the <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign> the <soCalled>Begum</soCalled> awoke with a start. Before
Sundra Bai could hurl herself after the girl muscular
fingers gripped her and held her fast. Struggle as
much as she liked she could not release herself, but
there was nothing to prevent her shrieking, and shriek
she did. Horsford brought his disengaged hand
down heavily over her mouth, but to no purpose.
She snapped at him like a dog; her teeth met in one
of his fingers, and she uttered a volley of screams.</p>

<p><q>You devilish she-cat!</q></p>

<p>The words wrung from him by the savage bite
<pb n="113"/>
were involuntarily uttered in English. The savage
old hag let so his finger and stared fixedly at him.
Horsford did not wait for the result of her inspec-
tion, but started to spring from the narrow ledge
in front of the cart on which he had been standing.
In turning, however, one of his feet slipped, and
he fell backwards. His head and shoulders struck
the yoke and he fell violently to the ground, where
he lay for a second or two slightly stunned.</p>

<p>He soon recovered, and as he was about to rise
he saw a long, deadly-looking matchlock gun pro-
truding from the tilt of the <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign>, and instead of
springing to his feet as he intended he crept away
on all fours. An Indian matchlock is not the
readiest of weapons to handle, and before Sundra
Bai could fire he had slipped to the back of the
<foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign>. Azeena and the girl had disappeared. He
started to run when a new danger overtook him.
The soldiers, hearing screams, had sped from the
<foreign xml:lang="hi">serai</foreign> by a short cut, and their yells proclaimed
that they had caught sight of him.</p>

<p><q>You devils,</q> he muttered, <q>I'll have to stay and
fight. The longer start Kulloo Bux has the better.</q></p>

<p>Horsford had not the slightest fear of the sol-
diers, excellent swordsmen though they might be.
The <soCalled>she-cat</soCalled> in the <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign> with her matchlock
was a more formidable foe, but he cared as little
for the woman with her matchlock as he did for
the men with their swords and spears. Matchlocks
were as erratic in their behaviour as the Brown
Bess of the British Army.</p>

<p>The yells of the soldiers and the flaring of a
torch put the old woman on the <foreign xml:lang="fr">qui vive</foreign>. She
jumped from the <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlee</foreign> and with the matchlock
<pb n="114"/>
gun trailing after her came running, or rather
waddling—for she was very fat—towards him,
shrieking as she ran. Horsford backed a couple of
paces so as to keep the trunk of the mango between
him and Sundra Bai's weapon and waited until
the soldiers were within a dozen yards or so of
where he was standing. Then—ping!—went his
heavy, double-barrelled pistol, pointed at their
legs. Two of the men fell to the ground, the
third, either amazed at what must have appeared
to him like magic, or, more likely imagining that
he was attacked by enemies in ambush, turned
tail and vanished, in spite of the bitter reproaches
hurled at him by the infuriated old woman.</p>

<p>Horsford now had no fear of pursuit. The
torch thrown to the ground was extinguished, and
the <soCalled>Begum</soCalled> could see no one to aim at. For
all that she fired the matchlock and a fearful clatter
it made, but none of its contents hit the retreating
Horsford. In a couple of minutes he had reached
the spot where Kulloo Bux had been waiting with
his cart. It was gone.</p>

<p><q>Good,</q> muttered Horsford. <q>Now for a sprint.
I once did a mile in five minutes at Addiscombe.
I shan't do that now, but I'll have a try.</q></p>

<p>It was not easy running along the soft, sandy
road, and there was a risk of attracting attention
by going at racing speed, but he chanced this.
Dressed as he was in native clothes he might well
be taken for a messenger. Luckily he met but
very few persons, and after proceeding about three
quarters of a mile he overtook the cart. He found
Kulloo Bux trembling with fright and urging on
his pony as much for his own sake as for Nara's.</p>

</div>



<div n="9" type="chapter">
<pb n="115"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="9">IX</num></head>
<head type="main"><q>I Want You</q></head>

<p>Horsford did not climb into the cart but kept up
a jog trot by its side, and contented himself by
assuring Kulloo Bux that he had nothing to worry
about. But not until the bridge of boats was
reached was the old man satisfied.</p>

<p>Here the next part of the programme was carried
out. Horsford had arranged everything. During
the journey Azeena and Nara had changed their
dresses for others the ayah had brought with her.
Kulloo Bux was to return the cart he had hired,
and Horsford, the woman, and the girl, were to cross
the bridge and enter the city on foot.</p>

<p>All went well. It was dark, and nobody paid
the slightest attention to them. Azeena and Nara
were disguised as poor workers in the fields, and
Horsford might well have passed for a beggar
with his torn garments covered with dust and
dirt. Horsford did not say a word to the child.
He was quite contented to see how she clung to
Azeena and her evident joy at being once more
with her faithful companion.</p>

<p>It wanted an hour of daybreak when they
reached <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mowatt's bungalow. Horsford deter-
mined to leave to Azeena the task of explaining
things to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt. Well as he could act the
<pb n="116"/>
part of a native, he might make some slip which
would betray him. Azeena, however, was quite
mistress of the situation and knew how to talk
to the servants. At the entrance to the com-
pound Horsford stopped, and the child, shifting
the scarf—she, like the ayah, was veiled—so that
she could see him better, looked up into his face.
From his height of six feet she seemed quite a dot.</p>

<p><q>Are you not coming with me, Sahib?</q> said she
timidly, in the soft, liquid tongue of her mother's race.</p>

<p><q>No—I must change my clothes. As I look now
the <foreign xml:lang="hi">chokadars</foreign> won't believe I'm Sahib. When next
you see me I shall be like your father in the picture.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, yes—yes, with the gold on your shoulders?</q>
she cried delightedly.</p>

<p><q>Not quite that. You shall see me in my finery
some other time. Remember that you're quite
safe with Azeena and that you must like the mem-
sahib. She will love you if you are good.</q></p>

<p><q>I promise you. Nara will keep her word,</q>
said the girl proudly.</p>

<p><q>I'm sure of that. Good-bye for the present,
little one. Don't forget that you're going to be
happy now that you're with your father's people.</q></p>

<p>Nara's eyes, at first sad and doubtful, brightened
at Horsford's words. She slid her little hand into his.</p>

<p><q>You will come soon, Sahib, won't you? I
shall be wretched till I see you.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes—yes. I shan't be long away,</q> rejoined
Horsford hastily. He dared not tell her that she
was to be sent away across the <soCalled>black water</soCalled> to
England. It would be time enough for her to know
this when kindly old <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt had gained her
confidence, and this he was sure would not take long.</p>

<pb n="117"/>
<p>He watched the two until they entered the
verandah, where a white-robed <foreign xml:lang="hi">chokadar</foreign>, hearing
their approach, roused himself, and a few words
passed between him and Azeena. The woman's
explanation was apparently satisfactory, for the
man ushered her and Nara into the bungalow.
Then Horsford hastened back to the shop of
Kulloo Bux in the lane near the Chandi Chauk.
Here he had left his European dress. Dawn was
breaking when he reached the house, and the
muezzin was sounding from the Jama Masjid.
Kulloo Bux had preceded him by a few minutes,
and at that moment was on his knees jabbering
a long prayer. Horsford did not disturb him,
but waited patiently until the recital was ended.</p>

<p>While the excitement of the flight was on, and
while he was jogging by the side of the cart, mile
after mile along the dusty road, Horsford had
never given a thought to Hoosein Khan. But
with the strain taken off his mind his memory went
back to that ghastly, dusky face, the parted, swollen
lips, the sightless eyes. He wondered what would
be thought when the body was found. Thuggism
as a system of wholesale murder and robbery had
been suppressed nearly twenty years, but the
methods of the thug had not been forgotten, and
there must be still living many who had used the
<foreign xml:lang="hi">roomal</foreign>, the fatal handkerchief with which the
thug strangled his victim. The marks of Azeena's
sinewy knuckles on Hoosein Khan's throat could
hardly fail to tell their tale should an English
doctor be called in. The procedure of the thug was
simplicity itself. The hands holding the <foreign xml:lang="hi">roomal</foreign>,
with five or six inches' space between the two thumb
<pb n="118"/>
joints, swiftly dropped over the head from behind,
the handkerchief was pressed tightly against the
throat, the thumb joints jerked violently into each
side of the windpipe, and the deed was done.</p>

<p><q>Confoundedly awkward,</q> thought Horsford.
<q>If it's once believed that Thuggism is about
again, our officials won't rest till they've probed
the business to the bottom. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt doesn't
know the facts, but she knows enough to put
the Delhi magistrate on the scent if she opens her
mouth. But will she? I don't think so. The
chances are that nothing will come of the affair.
<foreign xml:lang="hi">Goojurs</foreign> by scores and <foreign xml:lang="hi">budmash</foreign> by hundreds always
crowd to the Melás. Everybody knows that. I
doubt if the thing will reach the magistrate's ears
—the natives are pretty certain to think it was an
affair of the ordinary professional thief. There's
the <soCalled>Begum</soCalled> though—what will be her opinion?
Did she see Azeena? No, she was asleep and snoring
too, or she would have had that devilish long shooter
of hers out in a jiffy. Whatever may be said of
the ugly job it was done in perfect silence.</q></p>

<p>By this time Kulloo Bux had lifted his head
from the ground, and Horsford asked him whether
everything had gone well. Kulloo Bux gave a sigh
of satisfaction. He had returned the cart and pony,
he had paid for the hire, and he had nothing to
report. No one had interfered with him, and he
had entered the city free from the gaze of suspicion.
He hoped he had earned the Sahib's praise.</p>

<p><q>You've done first-rate. Did Azeena tell you
how the child was secured?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, surely, Sahib,</q> said the old man, with an
air of surprise.</p>

<pb n="119"/>
<p><q>And—about Hoosein Khan?</q></p>

<p><q>She said nought of him, Sahib.</q></p>

<p><q>Humph! that's as well,</q> muttered Horsford.
<q>Look here, Kulloo Bux,</q> he went on aloud,
<q>the best thing you can do is to forget last night's
work as soon as possible. It won't trouble you
any more. Take that as my farewell gift.</q></p>

<p>The eyes of Kulloo Bux glistened. The Sahib
had already treated him very liberally, and this
farewell gift was wholly unexpected. The old man's
brown hands clutched the money, and he invoked
Allah to shower blessings on his lordship's head.</p>

<p>By this time Horsford had done a quick change,
and nodding to the grain dealer, he set out to
return to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt's bungalow. He had
several arrangements to make before it could be
said he had fulfilled the trust imposed upon him.
The girl must have an outfit, and he determined
her dress should be English. She must be taught
to forget her old life as soon as possible. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Mowatt would have to be consulted about this.</p>

<p><q>To be quite satisfied in my mind, I ought to
accompany the old lady to Bombay, and see the
girl on board. I shall want leave of absence to
do this, and I'll have to make out a good case at
headquarters to get it. Under the awkward cir-
cumstances I can hardly tell them the story. If
it hadn't been for Azeena's <foreign xml:lang="hi">roomal</foreign> I'd have
found a soft corner in the official heart for poor
Jack Folliott. But Hoosein Khan's dead body
has sealed my lips—for the moment certainly. I
can't explain that without rounding on the woman.
I must spin a yarn about <q>urgent private affairs.</q></q></p>

<p>Fate, however, determined otherwise. Scarcely
<pb n="120"/>
had he passed through the Cashmeer Gate than he
met his adjutant. The latter reined in his horse
and hailed him.</p>

<p><q>Where the deuce did you spring from, Hors-
ford? I thought you were dining and <choice><corr>wining</corr><orig>wineing</orig></choice>,
waltzing and flirting at Simla.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, that was something of my programme
a week ago, but I had to run away on business.
In fact,</q> he added, telling a convenient fib, <q>I'm
on my way now to headquarters to get leave to
go to Bombay.</q></p>

<p><q>Bombay,</q> said the adjutant, with a grunt.
<q>That isn't the road to Burma.</q></p>

<p>Burma? What on earth was Adjutant Sin-
clair talking about? The adjutant must have
seen the look of surprise in Horsford's face. He
went on to say:</p>

<p><q>I thought by finding you here that, in some
wonderful fashion, you'd got to know that your
application for service in Burma had been accepted.
We've got the instructions—the usual pile of red
tape papers—and there's an official letter for you.
It would have been dispatched to Simla by special
messenger to-day, but now that you're here we'll
be saved the trouble.</q></p>

<p>Burma! Already his pulses quickened at the
prospect of active service. But Nara? Well,
he had made her safe. All he need do was to
arrange details with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt, provide for
the necessary expenses, and leave the future of the
child in the hands of her English aunts.</p>

<p><q>It's lucky that business brought you to Delhi,</q>
went on the adjutant. <q>Your orders are to start
without delay, and by being here you've saved
<pb n="121"/>
time. I shall see you later on in the day perhaps.
I'm off to Metcalfe House.</q></p>

<p>The adjutant waved his hand, his horse broke
into a trot, and Horsford went on to the canton-
ments to report himself. Two hours were spent
here in routine matters and in gossiping with his
brother officers, most of whom were anxious to
know the latest news from Simla, where the wives
and daughters of several were staying. But at
last he got away, and borrowing a comrade's
buggy, he drove to Mowatt's bungalow.</p>

<p><q>She is a sweet child,</q> said the old lady enthu-
siastically, <q>but so quiet and so sad. Of course
she doesn't talk much English, but she's very
quick and already she knows a few more words.
I'm sure before she gets to England she'll speak
just like an English child. But you must tell
me all about your adventures last night. I can
get nothing out of Azeena. What's the matter
with her? She's not the same woman she was.
She sits with her eyes fixed on the ground, and
she'll hardly speak even to Nara. The poor child's
greatly distressed.</q></p>

<p>Thus <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt, running on without waiting
for an answer. However she came back to what
was the most important question—how had the
girl been rescued?—a question which Horsford
found some difficulty in answering. He had to
do it by suppressing all reference to Hoosein Khan
and the fight with the soldiers, and somehow he
satisfied <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt's natural curiosity without
enlightening her. Then followed prosaic details.
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt was starting in three days' time, and
Horsford decided that he would delay his departure
<pb n="122"/>
for Burma until the lady and her charge were
safely out of Delhi.</p>

<p>Those three days were days of great anxiety.
Hoosein Khan had been murdered. Even an
ignorant person could tell this. Was a crime
to be perpetrated and no notice taken of it? What
of the wounded soldiers? Did they intend to
remain silent? Two days went over and no news
came. The <title>Delhi Gazette</title> appeared, and Horsford
searched its columns but found nothing. What
had the <soCalled>Begum</soCalled> been doing? Had she sent
tidings of the loss of Nara to Zeenut Mehal? Had
she dreaded the wrath of the Queen and kept
silence? The girls were her property, her income.
She was not the one to see her money slipping
through her fingers and look on quietly.</p>

<p>On the third day Horsford rode to the mango
grove. The Melá was nearly over; the road was
thronged with returning patrons, the <foreign xml:lang="hi">bahlees</foreign> were
gone from the grove. He called at the <foreign xml:lang="hi">serai</foreign>. He
knew that the sojourn of the <soCalled>Begum</soCalled> and her
dancing-girls would be talked about, and that he
could make inquiries concerning them without
exciting suspicion. Indeed the subject was one
in which a sahib-logue would be certain to be
interested. He learned that the girls had come
back from the Melá and that they had gone on
with the <soCalled>Begum</soCalled> to Delhi. But not a word
did he hear about Hoosein Khan.</p>

<p>Horsford returned to the city relieved in his mind.
He came to the conclusion that the old woman
had her reasons for hushing up the business, and
that the body of Hoosein Khan had been buried
in the sand and nothing said. He regarded the
<pb n="123"/>
incident as closed, and the next morning he went
on to Mowatt's bungalow to bid the child and her
good-natured protector farewell. He found the
<foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">dâk</foreign> in readiness and the runners squatting in the
shade until they received the order to start. As
he traversed the pretty garden Azeena suddenly
stole from behind a thicket and confronted him.</p>

<p><q>Sahib—Sahib,</q> she whispered agitatedly, <q>you
are in danger. Zeenut Mehal suspects. I have
heard news from the Palace. The <soCalled>Begum</soCalled>
arrived there with her girls, and the Queen was
furious when she heard about Nara. She has had
letters from his Highness the Rajah, and she knows
about you and what happened at the banquet. She
will never rest until she is revenged, and you may
be sure the <soCalled>Begum</soCalled> will help her.</q></p>

<p><q>Zeenut Mehal can do what she likes. Every-
thing has gone well. In a short time you and
Nara will be at Bombay, and by to-morrow I shall
be miles on my way to Calcutta.</q></p>

<p><q>Allah be praised!</q> cried the woman. Then
a shiver seemed to pass over her, and Horsford
heard her murmur, <q>If I had not the blood of
Hoosein Khan to answer for! Yet Allah knows
I was but an instrument in His hands!</q></p>

<p><q>Of course you were,</q> said he. <q>The old scoun-
drel was not fit to live. In England, where you are
going, I might take a different view of matters, but
here what you did was but justice. You've nothing
to fear. Nobody knows what happened. I rode
out yesterday to the <foreign xml:lang="hi">serai</foreign> and could learn nothing.
You are quite safe. Forget everything but your
love for Nara and for Nara's mother. Watch over
her. When you are in England <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt will
<pb n="124"/>
take leave of you and you will be with Nara's
relations, and then your troubles will end.</q></p>

<p>Guy Horsford's conscience pricked him as he
said this. The whole thing was pure assumption.
He had not the least idea how Nara's aunts would
receive her. But he had faith in <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt,
and if the girl's relatives refused to have anything
to do with her she would not be without a friend.
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt would not be at any expense, for he
had provided her with ample funds, though he had
impoverished himself considerably in doing it.</p>

<p>Azeena glided away, and Horsford went on to
the bungalow. Five minutes later he was escorting
the old lady and Nara, now in the orthodox flounces,
the ribbons and the straw hat of the little English
maiden. She looked pretty—nothing could spoil
her charm—but she was not so picturesque. She
had not got used to the shoes with straps, and she
walked very cautiously and quite without the old
freedom. The girl's eyes were filled with tears.
The costume had taken years from her. She
looked now the child that she was.</p>

<p><q>You will not forget me,</q> she whispered, when
Horsford bent down to say good-bye.</p>

<p><q>Forget you? Not likely, little one,</q> he
returned.</p>

<p><q>But will you come and see me?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, of course.</q></p>

<p>It was more probable they would never meet
again, but how could he tell her this?</p>

<p><q>When—when? I shall be wretched until you
come.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, it will be a long time, but you mustn't be
wretched. Kind friends are waiting you in England.</q></p>

<pb n="125"/>
<p><q>I don't want them. I only want you, Sahib,</q>
she burst out tremulously.</p>

<p><q>You must be patient. I shall see you again.
Now you must go. Promise me not to grieve.</q></p>

<p><q>I—I will try.</q></p>

<p>The voice was choking, the head bowed so that
the Sahib should not see her swimming eyes. He
took her hand; it lay limply in his for a couple
of seconds and then suddenly clasped his fingers.</p>

<p><q>Good-bye, my dear,</q> he whispered.</p>

<p>Her reply was a sob and a convulsive pressure
of his hand. He lifted her into the palanquin,
then he assisted <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt to follow.</p>

<p><q>I would like to have accompanied you to
Bombay, but it's impossible. I start for Calcutta
to-night to join General Godwin's force.</q></p>

<p><q>I understand. I wish you every good fortune.
You will come back a Colonel.</q></p>

<p><q>Or stay behind as I am,</q> rejoined Horsford,
with a shrug of the shoulders. He was silent for
a minute or so, and went on:</p>

<p><q>If there's any difficulty about Nara's aunts
don't hesitate to tell me. Write to me at Calcutta.
I may be hung up there for some time, as there's
nothing definitely settled about Burma. Good-
bye, and thank you sincerely for all the trouble
you're taking.</q></p>

<p>The last good-byes were said; the <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">dâk</foreign>-men
lifted the palanquin and moved away. Horsford
stood watching it for some time, saw a little hand
waving a bright coloured ribbon from between the
curtains as the bearers turned a corner, and the
palanquin disappeared.</p>

<p>He walked slowly back to headquarters. All
<pb n="126"/>
his preparations were made, and he had nothing
to think about save his adventures of the last few
days. But even these were beginning to fade.
They seemed strangely remote. Nara's big,
childish eyes, full of wonderment, innocence, and
affection, were the most vivid things in his memory.
He would never forget them, even though he never
saw the girl again. He entered the officers'
bungalow and sauntered into the mess-room.
Some of the officers had just come from morning
parade and were breakfasting.</p>

<p><q>A letter for you, Horsford,</q> said one man.
<q>You'll find it on the notice board.</q></p>

<p>Horsford went to the green baize-covered board
and took the letter from the crossed tapes under
which it had been stuck. The writing was un-
mistakably a lady's—in the fifties women had
not begun to write like men. The postmark was
Simla. In a flash Nara's dark eyes vanished from
his mental vision. He hesitated to open the letter.
It had brought back embarrassing recollections
of Clare Stanhope.</p>

<p><q>Impossible! She would never write. She's
far too proud,</q> he muttered. <q>Whether it was
her fault or mine that we broke away, doesn't
matter. It's just as well, perhaps. We were
bound to quarrel sooner or later.</q></p>

<p>He persuaded himself the letter was not from
Clare Stanhope. For all that he was in no hurry to
open it. He stared at the spidery loops, the acute
angles, the up and down strokes, the one as thin as
the other, and fancied he saw in the hand-writing a
resemblance to that of another Simla young lady.</p>

<p><q>It's from Millie Daintree,</q> he thought.</p>

<pb n="127"/>
<p>Millie had certainly flung herself at the head of
Guy Horsford. She was of the <soCalled>gushing</soCalled> type,
insipid and artificial, and Horsford had received
her blandishments very coolly. She was quite
capable of pursuing him with letters. At last he
tore open the envelope. His lips twitched as his
eyes fell on the contents.</p>

<p><q>Why did you go away? I want you. Come.</q></p>

<p><q><persName rend="sc">Clare.</persName></q></p>

<p>This was all. Had the letter been a long one,
full of reproaches, it would not have appealed to
him, as he considered he was not the offender.
But Horsford saw in those few words the passionate
side of Clare Stanhope's nature. They meant that
whatever might be his view of the matter, <emph>she</emph> had
not broken with him.</p>

<p>Nara's farewell wish, uttered in her soft, plain-
tive voice, still haunted him. <q>I only want you,
Sahib.</q> The words were almost identical with
Clare's passionate appeal. Was the coincidence a
forerunning of rivalry? He dismissed the question
with a shrug. Nara was but a child who for a
brief space had come into his life and had vanished
almost as quickly as she had appeared. In all
likelihood he would never see her again. No,
there was not any rivalry. Besides, had not Clare
also gone out of his life? And then—he might
be destined to find his last resting place in Burma.</p>

<p>Still he could not straighten out the thing to his
satisfaction. The feeling that he was bound to
Clare haunted him. If she had not written, or
had written in a different strain, he should have
set out that night for Calcutta with a clear con-
<pb n="128"/>
science. But his conscience was not clear. He
had acted hastily in taking Clare at her word.</p>

<p><q>It didn't seem so at the time,</q> he thought,
<q>but of course my request was an unreasonable
one and she was right in refusing. All the same,
I shall have to answer her letter.</q></p>

<p>Clare's direct appeal had come straight from
her heart. He could not doubt it. Until that
fateful night when his horse stopped of its own
accord at <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope's bungalow, Clare had
been to him little more than an amusing com-
panion, with the piquancy of sex which makes all
the difference between a man and a woman chum.
And had he not had the provocation of the dancing
incident at the Rajah's, and of the Rajah's wine,
the sound of Andrew Meldrum's voice would not
have stirred the devil within him. Well, what
had happened had happened, and he must take
the consequences, but how to reply to Clare was
the most embarrassing task he had ever under-
taken. There was, it is true, <emph>one</emph> way of getting
over the difficulty: he was about to depart on a
campaign from which he might not return; it
would be excusable if he put off writing until he
reached Calcutta.</p>

<p><q>That strikes me as cowardly,</q> he decided. <q>I'd
better write and get it over, but what the deuce am
I to say? Shall I take the olive branch Clare is
holding out? If I do will things be as they were
before we agreed to differ? And—what then?</q></p>

<p>A clock from within the bungalow struck. In
half an hour the men would arrive with the palan-
quin. He sat down at a table and commenced to
write desperately.</p>

<p><q>I can't wait—I <emph>won't</emph> wait—until it pleases Guy
to write, and he may never write unless I—— Oh,
it's horrid to think of—humbling oneself!—yet
what else is there to do?</q></p>

<p>Clare Stanhope walked to the mirror on the
wall. Flushed cheeks, anxious, strained eyes, lips
dry and pallid, met her gaze.</p>

<p><q>It's horrible how worry ages one! I look ten
years older than I did a week ago. I believe I
can see crowsfeet already. I wonder if I shall
be ugly when I'm old?</q></p>

<p>She laughed—a hard, mirthless laugh. Old?
What was the use of dwelling on such a prospect
at her age, twenty-one on her last birthday?
She had but just begun to live her life. She turned
impatiently from the mirror, and her gaze went
round the room. Everything in it reminded her
of Guy Horsford. She was conscious of an uncon-
querable yearning to see him, and of an equally
unconquerable loathing for Andrew Meldrum.</p>

<p><q>I promised <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum to let him have my
answer in a fortnight. A letter should reach Guy
in three or four days. If I address it to head-
quarters he's bound to get it as soon as it arrives.
<pb n="130"/>
He'll reply by return—of course he will,</q> she
added emphatically, <q>and I shall have his letter
well within the fortnight.</q></p>

<p>She ran to the writing-table and dashed into a
letter. She covered pages only to tear them up,
but it was a relief to let herself go, and she wrote
what she would like to say to Guy had she dared.
Reading over what she had written, she hardly
knew whether to laugh or weep. Then came the
final effort, when passionate outpourings, the tor-
rent of emotion, had dwindled down to the one cry
of her heart, <q>I want you. Come.</q></p>

<p>The letter was despatched. She told herself
over and over again it would bring him back.
Her feeling of certainty gave her courage and
steadied her nerves, and she was able to meet
Andrew Meldrum, when next she saw him, without
embarrassment. Meanwhile the shrewd and tactful
doctor was working quietly. He knew his niece's
capricious nature, and he was careful to warn
Meldrum that his best course was not to hasten
matters but to abide by Clare's promise.</p>

<p><q>That's all very well, but I don't understand
why Miss Stanhope hesitates,</q> said Meldrum, in
his hard way. <q>If she's made up her mind to
accept me, why doesn't she say so?</q></p>

<p><q>My dear Meldrum,</q> said the doctor, shrugging
his shoulders, <q>I'm afraid you've a lot to learn
about women, and especially about my niece.
No matter how deep the veneer of civilisation
may be, the primitive woman has a way of assert-
ing herself. She likes to be pursued, and she puts
off the moment of yielding as long as possible.
Don't you understand?</q></p>

<pb n="131"/>
<p>Andrew Meldrum stared blankly at Stanhope.
He had never bothered himself with such a problem
as the nature of woman.</p>

<p><q>Of course there's no rule,</q> pursued the doctor.
<q>With many women action depends upon the
whim of the moment, and this whim is as often
right as wrong. But every woman likes to be on
the winning side, and so far as you're concerned,
Meldrum, you've delivered yourself bound hand
and foot to the conqueror. Clare's sure of you,
so why should she hurry to end your uncertainty?
Besides, a woman must tease and tantalise. Now
if you wanted to bring things to a crisis you ought
to make love to some other girl.</q></p>

<p><q>Make love?</q> returned Meldrum slowly.</p>

<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope burst into a guffaw.</p>

<p><q>What amuses you?</q> growled the merchant,
a little nettled.</p>

<p><q>Your look of consternation at the idea. Why
shouldn't you make love? You ought to know
something about it since you're so desirous of
marrying Clare.</q></p>

<p><q>That's true, but—but I don't know I've ever
made love to Miss Stanhope—not in the ordinary
sense of the phrase. I'm afraid I should have a
difficulty in telling her what my feelings are to-
wards her,</q> returned Meldrum, with a constrained
air.</p>

<p><q>But you've told her you loved her?</q> said
the doctor.</p>

<p><q>No. I merely asked her to marry me. I
assumed she would take it for granted I should
not put such a question unless I loved her.</q></p>

<p><q>H'm! that's all very well from a business point
<pb n="132"/>
of view, but it's not the best way of entering upon
matrimony. A woman may know that a man
loves her, but she likes him to tell her so. But
we're drifting into abstract matters, and you, I take
it, are not much given to going beyond your own
personal concerns. I don't want to intrude my
advice, but from what I know of Clare I fancy that
a little of the conventional flummery called love-
making would not be displeasing to her. You see,
she's been used to a good deal of admiration, and
to have men fussing round her.</q></p>

<p>A look of uneasiness stole into Meldrum's hard
face.</p>

<p><q>I know—I know—and no man admires her
more than I do,</q> he returned, a little agitatedly.
<q>Clare's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
She's always amiable, and she has a thousand
pretty ways, all of which I've treasured up.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope wrinkled his grey eyebrows. He
was beginning to think this cold, impassive man
had depths in his nature one would hardly suspect
from his cold exterior.</p>

<p><q>'Pon my word, I'm beginning to be doubtful
whether I'm doing the right thing in pushing this
matter on,</q> mused the doctor. <q>One point's
certain. Whoever Clare loves if she <emph>does</emph> love
any one—it isn't Andrew Meldrum. For all that
the marriage may turn out right. Clare's level-
headed in spite of her apparent flightiness. Her
self-interest ought to keep her on the right path,
and dress, jewels, fallals, cutting a dash, and that
sort of thing will make her think twice before she
runs counter to her husband's wishes. All de-
pends upon how far Meldrum's willing to let her
<pb n="133"/>
have her own way. I can't do more than make
her understand the kind of man she will marry—
that is, if she accepts him, and I guess she will.</q></p>

<p>It looked as if Meldrum had heeded the doctor's
words about letting things take their own course,
for during the fortnight for which Clare had begged
he ceased to call. They met accidentally, however,
at an evening party, and she greeted him in her
usual gay, airy fashion. Meldrum, on the other
hand, was silent and embarrassed. He expected
she would show him some special recognition,
though in what way he could hardly determine.
So far as he could tell she seemed to pay more
attention to other men than she did to him.</p>

<p><q>Why does she laugh and talk and whisper
with that ape Lawton?</q> he muttered. <q>Surely
she can't take any interest in his silly gabble.</q></p>

<p>Then he thought of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope's opinion of
women, and wondered if Lawton's inane grins and
smirks and whisperings were anything like the
love-making the doctor talked about. He saw
Lawton press her hand as he led her to the piano.
He could have knocked the fellow down. He
ground his teeth when he saw the dandified lieu-
tenant bend across her shoulder to turn over the
leaves of her music. The action really meant
nothing, but to Meldrum it meant everything.</p>

<p>Clare was certainly more than usually provoking
towards Meldrum. She did not ignore him, but
she avoided going near the corner of the room
where he sat, glowering and pretending to listen
to the small talk of a <soCalled>grass widow.</soCalled> The
truth was Clare had an attack of nerves, and was
trying to hide her agitation under the mask of
<pb n="134"/>
gaiety. At last Meldrum could not endure the
sight of her frivolity any longer. He rose to go,
and his tall, gaunt frame, with its square shoulders
and slightly bowed legs, moved across the room
towards his hostess.</p>

<p><q>So soon, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum?</q> said the lady re-
proachfully. <q>Oh, you <emph>must</emph> stay for the acting
charade. Clare has arranged it. She's splendid
at such things. It's going to be capital fun. <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Lawton is in it. He's quite a droll. You'll enjoy
the charade, I'm sure.</q></p>

<p><q>I dare say,</q> said Meldrum grimly. <q>Sorry I
must go, but I've my Bombay manager coming to
see me, and we've a lot of business to talk over.</q></p>

<p>The excuse seemed rather a lame one, but <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Parker-Thompson accepted it. Perhaps she was
not sorry to do so. Somehow, Andrew Meldrum's
presence that evening was oppressive. Meldrum
was never much of a conversationalist at the best
of times, but he was rarely so silent and uncom-
panionable as he was to-night.</p>

<p>Clare was not unmindful of Meldrum's move-
ments. How could she be when he had hardly
been out of her thoughts all the evening? She
saw him take leave of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Parker-Thompson and
turn to go. She felt a pang of self-reproach. She
was tempted to follow him. She hesitated and
then tried to cross the crowded room. It was not
so easy; she was intercepted and detained more
than once, and when she reached the verandah
Meldrum was gone. She looked into the darkness
but saw no one. A vague feeling of disquietude
seized her. She hardly knew whether to be glad
or sorry that she had missed seeing him.</p>

<pb n="135"/>
<p><q>We were wondering what had become of you,
Miss Stanhope. General consternation—er——</q></p>

<p>She started. Lawton was speaking. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Parker-Thompson, anxious for the charade, had
sent him to search for her.</p>

<p><q>The room was so frightfully hot, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lawton.
I came out here for a little fresh air before begin-
ning. Are the others ready?</q></p>

<p><q>Ready and waiting. Aren't you well?</q></p>

<p><q>Of course I am. What do you mean?</q> she
asked, quite snappishly.</p>

<p><q>Beg pardon. I fancied you looked a little
pale.</q></p>

<p><q>What nonsense! Let us go back at once.</q></p>

<p>Lawton offered her his arm silently. Clare's
manner was so abrupt, so imperious, he thought he
had offended her. But the charade once started,
all trace of ill-humour disappeared. Her vivid
colour came back, her eyes sparkled once more,
and everybody declared she had excelled herself.
The charade was a brilliant success. Never had
Clare Stanhope been gayer, more fascinating. She
was overwhelmed with compliments.</p>

<p><q>Quite an accomplished actress is lost to the
stage, Miss Stanhope,</q> said Major Ormerod gal-
lantly.</p>

<p><q>H'm! what the stage has lost we've gained,
anyhow,</q> chuckled Colonel Chowden. <q>Hang it,
why you even inspired Lawton. He was really
amusing—for once. Thanks to you.</q></p>

<p>Clare laughed, accepted graciously all the fine
things that were said of her; danced every dance
that followed the charade, flirted outrageously—
at least this was the opinion of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod—and
<pb n="136"/>
apparently enjoyed herself to the utmost. It was
nearly daylight when she and her uncle departed.</p>

<p>The gradients of the road from <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Parker-
Thompson's bungalow were steep and irregular,
and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope had to drive carefully. For
some five minutes the pony occupied his attention.</p>

<p><q>I thought Meldrum was to be at the party,</q>
said he, when the buggy was on level ground.
<q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Parker-Thompson told me yesterday she
had invited him.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, he was there,</q> returned Clare, from behind
the folds of the wrap in which she had enveloped
her head, for the morning air was raw, <q>but he
left early.</q></p>

<p>The doctor made no answer. He decided that
his niece was not in the mood for confidences.
Presently, however, he spoke again.</p>

<p><q>A letter came for you just as I was leaving
home,</q> said he. <q>It had the Delhi postmark. I
didn't know you had any friends in the city.</q></p>

<p>This time it was Clare who was silent. Guy
Horsford had replied! The sudden crowning of
her hopes set every nerve quivering and she dared
not trust herself to speak. Her uncle took no
notice of her silence. He put it down to over-
fatigue. In about a quarter of an hour they were
inside the bungalow, and Clare had the letter in
her hand. She knew Horsford's writing, and the
sight of it sent her into a tremor. But not for
worlds would she betray herself to the doctor.</p>

<p><q>I'm too tired to read it now,</q> said she lan-
guidly. <q>I'll take it with me and open it to-morrow
morning. Good-night, uncle, dear.</q></p>

<p>Once in her room her languor disappeared. She
<pb n="137"/>
dismissed her ayah as soon as possible, and her
trembling fingers tore the envelope with feverish
haste. Her face altered as she read. It gradually
became white and rigid. The letter dropped on
her lap. She leaned forward, resting her elbows
on the arms of the bamboo chair, her hands press-
ing her temples.</p>

<p><q>Gone! Gone!</q> she murmured brokenly.
She stared blankly at the letter on her lap. For
the time being her brain was numbed. All she
was conscious of was her loneliness—her wasted
love.</p>

<p>Horsford had written kindly, but not passion-
ately—not like a lover. He was careful to explain
that his application to be allowed to join the Bur-
mese expedition had been made some time since,
and that the answer had come unexpectedly.
No doubt, so Clare decided, the summons reached
him at Simla and was the business which had
caused his hurried departure. This assumption
somehow softened her feelings of bitter resentment
and wounded pride, but the hard fact remained
that she might never see Guy Horsford again.</p>

<p>The thought crushed her, and after sitting for
some time quite motionless she crept to her bed,
but not to sleep. If she could have cried it would
have been a relief, but Clare was not one to whose
eyes tears came readily, and so she tossed and
twisted until her ayah came with tea. The doctor
was not surprised at her keeping her room. It
was natural that the excitement of the previous
evening should be followed by depression, and he
went tranquilly on his rounds. When he returned
to dinner he found Clare much the same as usual,
<pb n="138"/>
a little washed out, perhaps, but not more than
he expected. He looked at her narrowly and
wondered if she had given Andrew Meldrum his
answer, and if so what that answer was. The
fortnight expired that very day.</p>

<p><q>I guess they met last night and she gave him
his quietus,</q> he thought. <q>That accounts for
his going away so early.</q></p>

<p>The truth was Clare was pondering over the
letter of refusal she intended to send to Meldrum.
With the thought that Horsford had left her for
the sake of duty had come a tenderness towards him
which overpowered everything. It certainly in-
creased her dislike to Meldrum, and the advantages
which would follow a marriage with him no longer
weighed with her. To-morrow she would write
and do her best to let him down gently.</p>

<p>Before the dinner was over Ormerod called.
The Major was more important than usual in his
manner, and after a few commonplaces and com-
pliments to Clare on her success of the previous
evening, he burst out with his news.</p>

<p><q>Called on the Rajah this morning—found the
old boy awfully upset. A very awkward thing's
happened—it's a mystery or romance or whatever
you like to call it. You remember the night of the
little Eurasian dancing-girl, don't you, doctor?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I know what you mean. Well?</q></p>

<p><q>There was a dispute between Horsford and
the scoundrelly old Mahommedan who managed
the troupe—it turns out he wasn't the proprietor
as we all thought at the time—and to settle the
matter the Rajah took charge of the girl. Now
it appears that his Highness sent her to Delhi the
<pb n="139"/>
morning after the dinner-party—secretly so far
as I can make out—together with the rest of the
troupe, and the Rajah fearing an attack from some
source—he didn't tell me <emph>what</emph> source—gave the
party an escort of his soldiers. Sure enough an
attack <emph>was</emph> made, the girl was carried off, the old
Mussulman disappeared, and three of the men
were wounded. Now the point concerning us is
that the Rajah suspects that an Englishman was
connected with the abduction, and it looks to
me as if there was going to be some trouble—I
beg your pardon.</q></p>

<p>Ormerod stopped and glanced at Clare as though
he did not care to go on with the story. She under-
stood the glance. She had followed the narrative
breathlessly and was eager to hear more.</p>

<p><q>Yes, Major, and what happened?</q> she cried,
her eyes glistening.</p>

<p><q>That's where the mystery comes in. I'm not
sure whether I'm doing right in gossiping about
it,</q> said Ormerod, in his pompous manner.</p>

<p><q>That means you think I can't keep a secret?
Women have the reputation of not being able to
hold their tongues. I don't believe they're half
so bad as men.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, when the secret concerns themselves,
women can be as close as wax, but——</q></p>

<p><q>I promise you I won't breathe a word. Uncle
knows I can be trusted, don't you?</q></p>

<p>The doctor nodded, and at the same time gave
a non-committal shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p><q>Very well, what I was going to say is this—
the Rajah suspects that in some way Captain
Horsford was mixed up in the abduction. The
<pb n="140"/>
Rajah sets out to-morrow night for Delhi to make
inquiries into the matter, because it appears that
Zeenut Mehal holds him responsible for the
safety of the girl.</q></p>

<p><q>Sounds like a cock-and-bull story,</q> said the
doctor. <q>Horsford's not the man to compromise
himself in a scandal of that kind.</q></p>

<p><q>I should agree with you, doctor, if the question
was one of a passing fancy for a dancing-girl, but
it's more than that. It's quite certain Horsford
took a strong interest in her. Maybe he had good
reasons, and I daresay if the Rajah's suspicions are
justified, there may be an adequate explanation,
but there's an ugly rumour about the disappear-
ance of the old man, Hoosein Khan. It's feared
he's been done away with.</q></p>

<p><q>And does the Rajah accuse Horsford of
murder—I suppose that's what it comes to, eh?</q></p>

<p><q>He makes no accusation—he's far too cautious,
but when the thing's sifted you don't know what
may come out. But for Heaven's sake don't
breathe a word. I'm not sure it wouldn't be as
well to give Horsford a word of warning. It looks
odd his going off in such a devil of a hurry. I met
him, you know, just as he was starting. I thought
at the time he was precious close about the busi-
ness that was taking him to Delhi post-haste.
I'd better write and tell him of the Rajah's move-
ments; don't you think so?</q></p>

<p><q>There'd be no harm, of course. At the same
time I think you'll find that the Rajah's dis-
covered a mare's-nest. I'll make a point of
calling on him to-morrow before he starts and
sounding him on the subject.</q></p>

<pb n="141"/>
<p><q>Don't do that,</q> broke in Ormerod hastily.
<q>You see, he told me the story under a bond of
secrecy. Of course there was no harm in re-
peating what I heard to you because I'll wager
you know more secrets than any man in Simla.
That was why I hesitated about telling <emph>you</emph>, Miss
Stanhope. You'll forgive me, won't you?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh yes, I'll forgive you, and lest you may be
entrusting me with more secrets, I'll leave you
and uncle together.</q></p>

<p>Ormerod's perception was not keen, or he
would have noticed the hard note in Clare's voice.
She rose as she spoke. She knew the doctor's
eyes were fixed upon her, and fearing she might
betray herself she went to a cabinet, fetched a
box of cheroots, placed it on the table, and turned
away.</p>

<p>Ormerod's words had brought about a revulsion
of feeling. She knew, or thought she knew, the
key to his story. She hastily decided that Guy
Horsford had been telling her falsehoods. It was
not true, as he had written, that he had applied
some weeks before for leave to join the expedition
to Burma. He must have made his application
within the last fortnight in order to escape the
consequences of his recklessness and folly. She
did not think there had been any murder, but that
he had bribed Hoosein Khan to convey the girl to
some secret hiding-place. For anything she could
tell, Horsford's story of going to Burma might be
an invention. Of course its truth or falsity could
easily be determined, but for the moment she was
so carried away by her jealousy she was ready to
believe anything bad against him.</p>

<pb n="142"/>
<p>At that moment a servant brought in a card
and gave it to her.</p>

<p><q>Uncle, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum has called,</q> said she
hurriedly.</p>

<p>Clare and the doctor exchanged glances. Both
knew Meldrum's errand.</p>

<p><q>Shall I see him in the drawing-room?</q> she
went on.</p>

<p><q>It would be better,</q> was <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope's
laconic answer.</p>

<p>The two spoke in low tones and their words were
inaudible to Ormerod, who, meanwhile, was light-
ing a cigar. By the time he had taken half a dozen
whiffs Clare had quitted the room. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope
did not trouble to give the gossiping Major any
explanation. He preferred to wait events. If
Clare accepted Meldrum, Ormerod might as well
hear the news—it would not be the Major's fault
if half Simla did not hear of the engagement
within the next twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The doctor harked back to the subject of the
dancing-girl, both he and Ormerod agreeing that
if Horsford were really mixed up with the business
and Zeenut Mehal got to know of it, there was no
woman in India more subtle and deadly in her
schemes of vengeance than the Queen of Delhi.</p>

<p>Half an hour went by, and they heard a step
outside. Andrew Meldrum came in. He was alone.
His face was a little flushed, his manner was slightly
agitated, and his first words sufficed to tell the
doctor what had been the result of the interview.</p>

<p><q>Clare told me I should find you here, doctor,
so I've come straight away. How are you?</q>
said he, with unusual heartiness.</p>

<pb n="143"/>
<p><q>She has said yes,</q> thought <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope.
<q>I never expected it.</q></p>

<p><q>Congratulate me, doctor,</q> went on Meldrum,
in a voice of suppressed excitement. <q>Every-
thing is settled. It only remains now to fix the
wedding day.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stanhope grasped Meldrum's outstretched
hand.</p>

<p><q>I'm very—very glad,</q> said he. Then to
himself he grunted, <q>I hope it'll turn out for
the best. But——</q></p>

<p>The doctor completed the sentence with a shrug
of his shoulders.</p>

<p>During the next three weeks Simla worked
itself into a state of excitement over one of the
most sumptuous weddings which had ever taken
place among the English residents. The universal
opinion was that Clare Stanhope had secured the
biggest matrimonial prize in India.</p>

<p>Andrew Meldrum, so everybody declared, cer-
tainly <q>did the handsome thing</q> in every way.
He settled a princely sum on his wife; the honey-
moon was to be an extended tour among the
principal European cities; the presents to Clare
and her bridesmaids were most costly; no expense
was spared over the wedding festivities, and last,
but not least, the Bishop of Bombay was good
enough to take a special journey to Simla to read
the marriage service, and, assisted by a regimental
chaplain, bestow the blessing of the Church on
the happy couple.</p>

<p>Everything was orthodox, and not a hitch oc-
curred anywhere. The doctor gave his niece
away. She was more self-possessed than the
<pb n="144"/>
bridegroom, for she uttered the responses with the
utmost calmness, while there was a distinct tremble
in his voice. At the wedding breakfast Colonel
Chowden proposed the health of the bride and
bridegroom in what the <title>Delhi Gazette</title> called a
<q>facetious</q> speech, and Andrew Meldrum was
brief and business-like in his reply. When he
uttered the words <q>my wife</q> he looked down at
the bride with all the pride of possession pictured
in his hard face. Clare could not see the look,
but she must have been conscious of it. Her lips
tightened, and the corners twitched for an instant
as though something had jarred upon her nerves.</p>

<p>When the congratulations were over the newly
married pair drove away to a bungalow on Elisium
Hill, where they would stay until their departure
for Bombay. The merriment continued for some
little time, but now that the principal actors were
gone it was forced and soon subsided. The
guests dropped off, and the doctor was left with
half a dozen of his men friends to lounge in com-
fortable chairs in the verandah, drink, smoke,
and tell well-worn stories, more or less of the
mess-room type.</p>

<p><q>After all, there's something in Eastern cus-
toms,</q> grunted Colonel Chowden, when the smoke-
room conversation began to pall. <q>In England
we have to do all the work ourselves if we want
amusement. The natives here pay somebody
else to amuse them—in this confoundedly lazy
climate a far more sensible plan. If the doctor
was a rajah or a zemindar, he'd have engaged a
batch of big-eyed dancing-girls. We're all of us
just in the mood for an hour or so of that sleepy
<pb n="145"/>
fun, eh? By gad, wouldn't <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grundy have
had something to say, doctor, if you'd given us an
entertainment of that sort?</q></p>

<p><q>My dear Colonel, there's already <emph>been</emph> one
scandal—or the whisper of a scandal—concerning
a dancing-girl, and we don't want another,</q> said
the doctor.</p>

<p><q>You mean that affair at the Rajah's, when
Guy Horsford made himself such an ass over the
girl just because she was an Eurasian? By Jove,
our fellows would have enough to do if they fol-
lowed Horsford's example. What do you think
I heard——</q></p>

<p><q>The less said about the business the better,
Colonel,</q> interposed the doctor quietly. <q>We're
all Horsford's friends, and we're at liberty to
think what we like, but for Heaven's sake don't
let us put our thoughts into words. We all know
what Zeenut Mehal's party in the Palace is capable
of. Their ways are secret, their methods deadly.
We don't know the true story of the queer affair,
but <emph>they</emph> may. Horsford's on his way to Rangoon
with Godwin's force, and may never return. Better
forget the business altogether for the sake of all
concerned.</q></p>

<p>A silence followed the doctor's words. He had
given Guy Horsford's comrades something to
ponder over.</p>

<p><q>We shall have to do something for her, Sophia,</q>
said the wife of the General.</p>

<p><q>I suppose so,</q> sighed the wife of the Com-
missioner. <q>The question is, what? She'll have
to live somewhere, of course, but really, Lavinia,
I've no room I can spare at present.</q></p>

<p><q>Nor I,</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> General Brampton sharply.
<q>I'm much worse off than you in that respect.
As you know, we've only taken our house for the
season while the Exhibition's on, and it's hardly
large enough for our wants as it is. When our
term is over, we're going to Harrogate. The
General intends to take a course of the waters for
his gout. To have a child tacked on to us is out
of the question. I'm sure the General wouldn't
countenance such a preposterous thing for a
moment.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Commissioner Spicer pursed up her lips
and gave a little sniff. There was too much of
her sister's husband, the General, in the conversa-
tion to please her, but she dared not express her
opinion openly. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Commissioner Spicer was
quite aware that her brother-in-law, <q>the General,</q>
was somebody. People understood perfectly well
<pb n="147"/>
the rank of a general, but they were not so clear
about the rank of a commissioner, and those who
knew what a commissioner was in India were very
doubtful whether he was anything at all in Eng-
land. Certainly in India the wife of Commissioner
Spicer occupied a lower social position than that
of the wife of General Brampton, and the habit
of deferring to her sister Lavinia could not be
shaken off by Sophia, though they were no longer
bound by the fetters of Anglo-Indian etiquette.</p>

<p>The two ladies differed as much in their per-
sonal appearance as in their social status. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
General Brampton was a massive person with a
pendulous double chin which wagged when she
was particularly emphatic. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Commissioner
Spicer, on the other hand, was thin, angular, and
faded. Notwithstanding these unprepossessing
characteristics and her querulous voice she had
a better nature than her sister, who was as selfish
as she was pompous. Aunt Sophia lived in Bays-
water, a quarter of suburban London much
favoured at that time by Anglo-Indians. Aunt
Lavinia had called on purpose to assist in Nara's
reception, and she was sitting in state.</p>

<p><q>Still, something must be done,</q> went on <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Spicer, in a tone of resignation. <q>In half an
hour the child will be here, and we can't turn her
out.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course not. Who is suggesting such a
thing? You must find a corner for her some-
where, Sophia, until we can settle upon some plan.
The thing has come so suddenly upon me, I've
had no time to consult the General.</q></p>

<p><q>She'll have to be sent to boarding-school, I
<pb n="148"/>
imagine,</q> hazarded <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Spicer, with a furtive
glance to see how her sister would take this daring
proposition.</p>

<p><q>That's an easy way out of the difficulty, but
who's to find the money?</q> retorted <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bramp-
ton. <q>Poor Jack left nothing behind him but
his debts. He was always extravagant and reck-
less even at Addiscombe. This marriage of his,
sprung as a surprise upon us, is a frightful humilia-
tion.</q></p>

<p><q>I wonder if Jack really married the girl?</q> said
the Commissioner's wife after a pause.</p>

<p><q>I dare say he did. He was fool enough for
anything when a woman was concerned,</q> re-
torted the General's lady sharply. <q>A marriage
with a native adds to the disgrace.</q></p>

<p><q>It also adds to our responsibility,</q> sighed
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Spicer.</p>

<p><q>That's the worst of it. No one thinks much
of the irregular connections young men form in
India, but a marriage is a very different matter.
If Jack really went through any kind of ceremony,
I doubt if it's binding. We should be perfectly
within our rights, I think, in declining to have
anything to do with the girl. I suppose we must
give her house-room, but really, that's all we
are bound to do.</q></p>

<p><q>Captain Horsford speaks very highly of her
mother. He says she was a descendant of royalty.
Her ancestors were the Kings of Delhi.</q></p>

<p><q>That may be, Sophia, but if you've heard, as I
have, the shocking stories of what used to go on
in the Palace of Delhi you'd say such a descent
was no particular honour. What weighs with me
<pb n="149"/>
is that if we don't recognise the girl something
may be said that may damage us with the Com-
pany. Edgar will shortly be leaving Addiscombe
and I don't want anything to mar his prospects.
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt is certain to write to her son an
account of the affair, and we must try to make
the best of a bad business.</q></p>

<p>Ever since the days of Peter Folliott, who laid
the foundation of the fortunes of the Folliott
family, the East India Company could always
boast of a Folliott high up in office either as a
company official or in the army. The Folliott
boys were educated to believe fat appointments
would drop into their mouths through <soCalled>influ-
ence.</soCalled> The Folliott girls expected rich husbands
by the same means, and as soon as they were old
enough were carted off to India to secure matri-
monial prizes.</p>

<p><q>I quite agree with you on that point. I have
Honoria as well to think of, and my own view
of this disagreeable matter is that we should keep
it as quiet as possible. Nobody need know that
Jack married a native woman and had a daughter.
If it can be managed I should suggest that the
girl be sent to boarding-school and put in the way
of earning her own living, and when she's old
enough we can wash our hands of her. I've no
doubt I can persuade Harry to contribute some-
thing yearly towards the expenses.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton frowned, as she always did
when any question of parting with money was
mentioned. But she quite agreed with her sister's
notion of hushing up the matter.</p>

<p><q>It was a very silly thing of Captain Horsford
<pb n="150"/>
to meddle with the matter. The girl must have
relations on her mother's side. Why couldn't he
have left her in their charge?</q></p>

<p><q>He said something in his letter about them
ill-using her.</q></p>

<p><q>Silly sentiment, depend upon it. His story
is very vague. It's all because of his promise to
look after Jack's child. According to his own
story he lost sight of her for six years and he
doesn't explain how he found her. Who's to say
he hasn't been imposed upon? The native girls
are very much alike. I was always making
mistakes when I was in India.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Spicer could only murmur that she was
sure that Captain Horsford had satisfied himself
on the question of identity before taking the
grave step of sending the girl to England. In
writing to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, Guy Horsford had been
very reticent on many important points. For
very good reasons he had not said a word about
Nara having been a dancing-girl; indeed, he had
given <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt strict instructions not only to
be silent on the subject but to warn the girl to
keep her past in the dark.</p>

<p>The sound of cab wheels was heard. Aunt
Sophia went to the window with a not unnatural
curiosity; Aunt Lavinia, who regarded curiosity
and every other weakness of human nature as
<q>unladylike,</q> remained in her easy-chair by the
fire, which in the wet and inclement June of 1851
was not unacceptable.</p>

<p>Aunt Sophia's heart fell when she saw through
the murky air the pile of luggage on the top of
the cab. Responsibility thrust upon her, whether
<pb n="151"/>
she would or not, seemed to be written in those
trunks of various sizes.</p>

<p><q>It's too bad of Lavinia to put everything on
me,</q> murmured the angular lady. <q>She has
much more money than I have, and as for her
house being small, that's a mere excuse. But
Lavinia was always clever in sliding out of any-
thing that was disagreeable.</q></p>

<p>The cabman had opened the door, a girl dressed
in black sprang out lightly, followed by portly
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt leaning heavily on the cabman's
arm. Aunt Sophia turned from the window and
approached her sister, who was sitting bolt up-
right with a severe, semi-military carriage of the
shoulders.</p>

<p><q>Well,</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, <q>and what's the
child like?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, she's much fairer than I expected and
taller than most Indian girls of her age. But
poor Jack was very tall, you know.</q></p>

<p>The servant ushered in <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt and Nara,
whose hand was in that of the kindly lady to
whom the girl had become much attached, especi-
ally after the death of Azeena, who had been
seized with cholera during the voyage. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Mowatt had written from Southampton to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Brampton, and as the letter contained all that
was necessary to explain her errand she had but
to introduce Nara to her aunts and the trust
would be at an end.</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton received her visitors with the
cold condescension a general's wife would naturally
bestow upon the relative of a bank official. Her
sister was a little more cordial. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt's
<pb n="152"/>
shrewd eyes read the characters of the two ladies
in an instant, and her heart went out in pity to
the girl. She felt that a hard time was in store
for the lonely child.</p>

<p>Many a time Nara had tried to fancy what her
aunts would be like. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt was the only
English woman she had known intimately and
she believed all other English women would be
as nice and as kind. But Aunt Lavinia's double
chin and Aunt Sophia's pale eyes and yellow
complexion chilled and repressed her. Her
slender fingers instinctively tightened their grasp
on <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt's hand as Aunt Lavinia surveyed
her critically through large, gold-rimmed eye-
glasses. Aunt Sophia was the first to speak.</p>

<p><q>How do you do, my dear?</q> was her greeting
in rather a high-pitched voice.</p>

<p><q>Quite well, thank you—aunt.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt, during the long voyage, had care-
fully tutored the girl in English generally and
especially in the phrases which she thought would
be useful. One of these phrases was the reply to
Aunt Sophia's greeting, and Nara pronounced the
words very correctly, though the <q>aunt</q> came
out with an effort, partly because she was nervous
and partly because an inclination to burst into
tears had unexpectedly seized her. But experience
had taught her to restrain her emotions, and neither
of her aunts suspected the tumult that set her
heart fluttering. The twitching at the corners of
her mouth ceased, and with her big eyes fixed on
Aunt Lavinia she advanced towards that lady
and stood patiently while undergoing the ordeal
of a cold kiss.</p>

<pb n="153"/>
<p><q>I am your Aunt Lavinia,</q> said the General's
wife condescendingly.</p>

<p><q>Yes, aunt.</q></p>

<p><q>And that's your Aunt Sophia.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, aunt.</q></p>

<p>Nara's tone and manner seemed to indicate
that she was neither impressed by nor grateful
for the information. Aunt Sophia's kiss, however,
was a little warmer than that of her sister, and
perhaps had the girl been alone with the Com-
missioner's wife the barriers of restraint might
have been broken down. As it was, Aunt Sophia
thought she was sullen, Aunt Lavinia that she was
obstinate, and maybe sly and treacherous, and
the lady decided that her superfluous niece was
likely to be an endless source of trouble.</p>

<p><q>And haven't you anything to tell us about
your voyage, or—about your father?</q> asked <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Brampton, after an embarrassing silence.</p>

<p>Nara could have given her aunt plenty of in-
formation about her voyage, and though she was
only five years old when she last saw her father
she remembered him perfectly well, and might
have described him had not <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton's pat-
ronising manner paralysed her; but she could
think of nothing to say. All she could do was to
murmur a faint <q>No.</q></p>

<p><q>Where's the locket with the portrait of your
father in it?</q> said the lady sharply and with a
view to springing a mine upon the girl.</p>

<p>Nara shrank back, her hands pressed on her
throat.</p>

<p><q>No, no!</q> she cried wildly. <q>I will not give it
to you. It is mine. You shall not take it from me.</q></p>

<pb n="154"/>
<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton frowned. All her suspicions
were aroused. She regarded the portrait as crucial
evidence of Nara's identity. Of course Horsford,
in his letter, had laid much stress upon its im-
portance.</p>

<p><q>I don't want to take it, but unless you let me
see the picture I shall look upon you as an impostor
and deal with you accordingly. I suppose your
refusal means you haven't any locket in your
possession?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton,</q> broke in <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt
warmly, <q>you're unjust. Nara has shown the
locket to me.</q></p>

<p><q>Permit me to deal with my own affairs in my
own way, madam,</q> retorted <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton
loftily. <q>You may have seen the locket, but I
presume you have never seen the late Captain
Folliott.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt made no reply but turned to Nara.
It was doubtful if the latter understood all that
Aunt Lavinia said to her. She was too agitated,
too anxious to guard her treasure. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt
did her best to explain and at last the girl with
some difficulty drew the locket from beneath the
bosom of her dress. But she would not give it
up; she would only allow <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton to
look at it while it was lying in her hand.</p>

<p>One glance was enough for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton. For
the first time she showed something like natural
emotion. The miniature was the work of a clever
French artist who had settled in Calcutta. It
had been painted soon after Jack Folliott's arrival
in India. It was life-like, and represented Jack
exactly as his sister had last seen him. In rather
<pb n="155"/>
a shaky voice she called to her sister, who was
holding a conference with Davis, the parlour-
maid, at the door, and the sisters talked together
in whispers, Nara's eyes fixed on them both. An
evident look of relief stole over her face when she
was permitted to replace the locket in its hiding-
place.</p>

<p>The production of the miniature had done one
thing: it had convinced her aunts that she must
be permitted to stay.</p>

<p><q>You'd better go with Davis,</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Spicer.
<q>I dare say you'd like to wash your face and brush
your hair. Say good-bye to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt, and
thank her for all her kindness.</q></p>

<p>The girl was glad to get away from the glare of
the gold-rimmed glasses, which had gone back to
their customary resting-place on the bridge of
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton's nose, and she turned hastily to
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt. At first it looked as if the leave-
taking between her and the child would be a formal
affair. Nara was timidly putting out her hand,
when forgetting the presence of her aunts she
suddenly resorted to the ways of her race, and
dropping upon one knee she lifted the hem of
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt's skirt and kissed it. Aunt Lavinia
exchanged a horrified glance with Aunt Sophia, of
which <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt was quite oblivious. She only
saw the sad, pleading face upturned to hers, and
bending down she raised the supple form and
kissed her in tender, motherly fashion. The em-
brace was too much for the child. Her self-control
broke down and she burst into a fit of passionate
weeping.</p>

<p><q>Take Nara with you. I will be your servant
<pb n="156"/>
—your slave. I love not your England. It is
cold and dark—and—and I do not like these ladies.
You said they would be like my dear father. They
are not. Let me go back to my own country—
to my own dress. I want to see Sahib Horsford
again. He was kind—he—he——</q></p>

<p>Her words ended in a convulsive sob. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Mowatt soothed her as best she could and was
thankful that they were not sufficiently near Nara's
formidable aunts for the latter to distinguish what
the distracted girl was saying. At last Nara's
tempest of grief died away; she relapsed into her
patient self-control and Davis, who had been stand-
ing at the door all the time, marched her off. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Mowatt would have taken her departure, but she
was not allowed to escape without Aunt Lavinia's
putting her through a species of cross-examination.</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> General Brampton was exceedingly per-
tinacious on the subject of Nara's mother. Who
was she? What was she? Where was she married
to Jack Folliott? How came Captain Horsford to
have Nara in his charge? Who had the custody
of the girl before Horsford appeared upon the
scene?—and a dozen other questions equally
searching and equally awkward to answer.</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt adroitly sheltered herself behind
Horsford. She knew nothing of Nara's relations.
She did not even know her story. Captain Hors-
ford had asked her to see the girl to England and
deliver her to her aunts, and she had kept her
promise. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton's ingenuity in the way
of pumping was of no avail, and at last the
badgered visitor was permitted to go her way.</p>

<p><q>What do you think, Sophia?</q> said the
<pb n="157"/>
General's wife, relaxing her military-like attitude
when she and her sister were alone.</p>

<p><q>What is <emph>your</emph> opinion, Lavinia?</q> returned the
Commissioner's wife cautiously.</p>

<p><q>Why, that the woman knows more than she
chooses to say. She <emph>must</emph>,</q> added the lady with
conviction. <q>I feel strongly tempted to write to
the Resident at Delhi and ask him to make in-
quiries.</q></p>

<p><q>That's an excellent idea, but it will be more
than six months before we can possibly expect an
answer, and what's to do done in the meantime
with the girl?</q></p>

<p><q>She must be sent to boarding-school, unless
you can see your way to take charge of her.</q></p>

<p><q>Indeed, I can't! There's so much uncertainty
about her origin that I don't think it's right for
Honoria to associate with the girl until we know
more about her than we do at present. She
must go to boarding-school and the Commissioner
and the General must find the money between
them.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton sighed, but she could not see
any other way out of the difficulty, and she raised
no objection.</p>

<p><q>What is your opinion of the girl,</q> asked Aunt
Sophia presently.</p>

<p><q>I don't like her eyes, I mistrust a girl with long,
sweeping lashes and pallid complexion. Of course
the Indian blood accounts for both in Nara's case,
but that doesn't alter my opinion. Girls like
Nara look sleepy, but don't be deceived; they're
wide enough awake where men are concerned.
However, there it is, we must make the best of
<pb n="158"/>
things, and we must look out a suitable school
for her as soon as possible.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton rose, arranged the enormous
brooch on her shawl in front of the mirror, de-
clared that she must go, as she had several calls to
make, and took her departure with an air of having
settled the unpleasant business to the satisfaction
of everybody concerned.</p>

<p>A week went slowly by. Aunt Lavinia busied
herself in finding a <q>suitable</q> school for Nara, a
matter more difficult than it appeared at first
sight. Directly it was made known that the girl
was an East Indian, and had only recently come
to England, the terms were at once raised. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Spicer could, had she chosen, have sent her to
the <q>select seminary for young ladies</q> where her
own daughter was being educated but for fear of
<q>caste contamination.</q> <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton at once
vetoed such a suggestion.</p>

<p>As for Nara the first week in England was one
of purgatory. It was not that any one in the
house was unkind to her, but all was so strange,
so utterly outside her experience and even her
comprehension, and what was worse than all, she
knew perfectly well she was not wanted. She
understood much more English than she could
speak, and words were let fall the meaning of
which was quite plain to her though not intended
to be so.</p>

<p>A succession of grey, rainy days added to her
depression. She missed the Indian sun, the cloud-
less skies of the East, the glowing colours of the
bazaars and streets, the excitement of the dance.
Never once did she show her real, warm-hearted,
<pb n="159"/>
impulsive nature to her aunts. They regarded her
as a shy, sullen, disagreeable, discontented girl.</p>

<p>In Aunt Sophia's house everything was done
by clockwork. The breakfast, the luncheon, the
dinner might have been arranged on the slot
principle, so punctually and mechanically did they
make their appearance. It was the same in other
ways. Aunt Sophia believed in long, objectless
walks, taken as some people take medicine, as a
kind of self-imposed duty. They were very dreary
to Nara, these walks, especially when Aunt Sophia
accompanied her. With Davis they were not so
bad. Davis was fond of Kensington Gardens,
where there was comparative freedom, and the
strolls here were the only breaks in the monotony
of the girl's first experience of life in England.</p>

<p>Meanwhile none of the schools suggested by
Aunt Sophia were approved of by Aunt Lavinia.
They were to her mind too expensive, and one
day she descended upon her sister full of bustling
importance. Nara, peeping furtively over the
stair-rail of the first landing, saw her sail into the
dining-room, her stiff silk dress rustling ominously.</p>

<p>The ladies had a long talk. Aunt Lavinia had
found at Brighton just the establishment, the pro-
prietress of which was quite willing to enter into
negotiations for the future. The idea was that
as soon as Nara was qualified she was to become
a sort of pupil-teacher or under-governess, with a
view to reduce expenses, and to train her in the
path she was to follow.</p>

<p><q>That's an excellent notion,</q> exclaimed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Spicer. <q>The child's wonderfully sharp—almost
too sharp. It's amazing how she's picked up
<pb n="160"/>
English. The worst of it is she doesn't know
good from bad, and she's getting to talk just like
Davis, whose ideas of grammar are anything but
correct. No doubt what she needs is that her
energies should be turned into the right channel.</q></p>

<p><q>Quite so. We must put that before her in
plain language. There ought to be no mistake.
We'd better have her down at once, and lose no
time in letting her know her position.</q></p>

<p>Aunt Sophia agreed, and was very much relieved
when her sister undertook to explain everything
to Nara. Accordingly the girl was summoned,
and after submitting to a peck, in the shape of a
kiss, stood to endure the next ordeal, feeling very
much like a criminal awaiting the sentence of the
judge.</p>

<p><q>We want to give you a start in life, Nara,</q>
said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, with a crushing use of the
big, gold-framed eye-glasses, <q>and after that you
must depend upon yourself. You mustn't sup-
pose that you can come to me whenever you want
money simply because I happen to be your aunt.
I have my own responsibilities and my own
expenses, which are very heavy, so that I trust
you won't delude yourself with the impression
that you can claim anything from me simply
because your father was my brother. The first
thing you'll have to do is to imagine that you're
an English girl. You must forget all about India,
and you must try to adapt yourself to our ways.
Fortunately, your East Indian origin isn't very
prominent in your face, and you might belong to
any Southern nationality. I don't see why you
should not pass for a native of the South of France.
<pb n="161"/>
If you learned the language thoroughly it might
help you in after-life. But we'll talk of that
later on. You're intelligent enough to know
what I mean. You may go now and think over
what I've said.</q></p>

<p>The preliminaries settled, Nara's departure was
hastened. She had led so nomadic a life that the
spirit of restlessness was in her blood, and any-
thing in the way of a change was welcome. There
was nobody in the prim Bayswater house from
whom she would part with regret excepting Davis,
the parlour-maid. Nara had not the slightest
idea that, regarded from Aunt Sophia's point of
view, Davis was vulgar and <q>common.</q> She
only knew that the servant was honest, good-
humoured, and good-natured, and she clung to
the Cockney-bred girl as she had clung to Azeena.</p>

<p>In spite of Nara making a friend of Davis the
latter knew little more about her than did anybody
else. Nara had borne in mind <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt's
repeated cautions to keep her experience as a
dancing-girl to herself, and she only once betrayed
what had been her calling. This happened one
evening when she was about to go to bed—she
slept in Davis's room—and a German band was
playing some sentimental air of the Fatherland.
There may have been in the melody a phrase
which suggested recollections of Azeena's <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">saringhee</foreign>
and the song she used to croon, but whatever it
was the impulse to dance was irresistible, and she
suddenly glided into the most difficult, the most
complicated, and the most fascinating of her
dances.</p>

<p>Davis stared spell-bound as the slim, graceful
<pb n="162"/>
figure circled noiselessly round the room, waving
her arms and twisting her lithe body. A delicate
rose-tint suffused the olive skin, the lips parted,
and in the half-light the effect was ethereal, fairy-
like.</p>

<p><q>My goodness, Miss Nara,</q> said the admiring
Davis, <q>wherever did you learn to dance ? If it
don't beat anything I've ever seen at a panter-
mime. Lor, if I could turn about and do steps
like that I wouldn't stand no more of Missus's
everlasting nagging. I'd go on the stage, <emph>I</emph>
would.</q></p>

<p>The music stopped and Nara stopped too; the
spell was broken. For a few minutes she had in
imagination gone back to India. She crept to
Davis panting. She was out of practice, and the
arduous exercise had tried her severely.</p>

<p><q>You mustn't tell any one,</q> she whispered im-
ploringly.</p>

<p><q>Tell what, Miss?</q></p>

<p><q>That I danced. The Sahib might hear of it,
and he would be angry.</q></p>

<p><q>Sahib—what Sahib?</q> asked the puzzled
Davis.</p>

<p>Nara shook her head and put her forefinger on
her lips. Davis understood that she was to keep
the matter a secret, but this did not prevent her
putting a few questions concerning the Sahib.
But nothing was to be extracted from Nara.</p>

<p>Aunt Lavinia completed her work by taking
Nara down to Brighton and handing her over to
the care of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Granger, who kept an extremely
genteel seminary for young ladies, <q>the daughters
of gentlemen only accepted,</q> to quote the pros-
<pb n="163"/>
pectus. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton had driven a hard bar-
gain as to the terms on which Nara was to be
admitted. But the proprietress was only too glad
to have the patronage of a General's wife, and she
agreed to take the girl at reduced fees on the
understanding that she was to be made use of in
every way possible.</p>

<p>And so for five years it was destined that Nara's
experience of England, of English life and manners,
should be confined to the narrow, the artificial
world of a boarding-school for young ladies. What
a <q>genteel</q> boarding-school in the fifties was
like perhaps some of the grandmothers of the
present generation may remember.</p>

<p><q>I really don't know what's to be done with
you, Nara. It's terrible, after so much money's
been spent upon your education, to find that
you're incapable of doing anything to earn your
own living. In the face of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Granger's letter
I can't see I'm called upon to help you any further.
Of course I can't turn you out of doors, but—
well, I'm in despair. I daren't ask the General
to assist me. He was always strongly opposed to
my recognising you as my niece. He says you
ought to have been sent back to India.</q></p>

<p>Aunt Lavinia, whose ample form time had
increased, and whose chin was weightier and more
pendulous than ever, sank back in a hard and
uninviting armchair, upholstered in red and grey
striped satin, highly suggestive of sugar-sticks,
and folding her fat hands twisted her diamond
rings and stared helplessly first at the French
clock under a glass case on the mantelpiece, then
at the crystal lustres at each corner, and finally
allowed her eyes to rest on two sepulchral vases
modelled out of cannel coal, their only claim to
distinction being that they were bought at the
'51 Exhibition and considered great curiosities.</p>

<pb n="165"/>
<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton had seen very little of Nara
during the last five years. The girl spent the
summer vacation at the school, as the General
and his wife generally went on the Continent—to
Boulogne preferably on account of its cheapness—
leaving the servants on board wages, the best
rooms denuded of carpets and curtains, the crystal
chandeliers and the furniture swathed in brown
holland, and every blind save those in the attics
drawn down.</p>

<p>Nara was allowed to pass part of the Christmas
holidays in Portman Square, but she was always
glad to get back to the school, comfortless though
it was. The haughty condescension of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Brampton, the ostracism of the General—only
by accident did she ever see him, and he invariably
ignored her—the sense that she was an interloper,
wounded her proud spirit beyond measure, but
with the patience and resignation which belong to
one phase of the Eastern nature she showed no
resentment. At her aunt's solemn parties she was
introduced to no one, and she moved about like
a ghost. People wondering who she was made
guesses at her nationality, and thinking she could
speak no English did not attempt to talk to her.
Her passiveness, her indifference to naggings and
snubs, were put down to sullenness. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton
did not understand her, and never tried to do so.
Aunt Sophia was dead, or things might have been
different.</p>

<p>The girl was now standing in the centre of the
room, waiting for Aunt Lavinia to resume. The
lady was in no hurry. She was pondering over
the shock she had received that day in the sudden
<pb n="166"/>
appearance of Nara, who had descended upon her
from Brighton without any warning. Nara's ex-
planation was that she felt she could stay no longer
in the school, and so she had left. She thought
the simple reason she gave would be quite suffi-
cient, and looked quite astonished when Aunt
Lavinia began to scold and upbraid her with such
violence that most girls would have burst into tears.
But not Nara. She stood mutely until <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Brampton relapsed into a lamentation over the
responsibility cast upon her.</p>

<p>Yet Aunt Lavinia ought not to have been sur-
prised. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Granger had written a week before
to ask her to take the girl away, as she did not find
her of the least use. The lady's chief complaint
was that in spite of Nara having been at the
school five years she could not take even a very
juvenile class, and had not the slightest aptitude
for teaching. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Granger also hinted that she
was a cause of embarrassment in regard to her
attractiveness, so much so that orders had to be
issued that she was not to accompany the pupils
when they took exercise on account of the way
gentlemen looked at her. More than once the
young ladies had been followed, and the governesses
in consequence had had the greatest possible
trouble in maintaining discipline.</p>

<p><q>It's only what I expected,</q> moaned <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Brampton, when she read about this enormity.
<q>I told poor Sophia I mistrusted the girl's sleepy
eyes.</q></p>

<p>The reason of Nara's sudden rebellion was that
she had had a visit from <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt, and what the
old lady said to her had unsettled her mind. Nara
<pb n="167"/>
regarded <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt as Horsford's close friend,
and of course she eagerly inquired about him.
Horsford had indeed written to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt
for news of his <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">protégée</foreign>, and before the lady replied
she determined to call at the school. All, however,
that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt could tell Nara about Horsford
was that he was still in India—to good <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt
Burma <emph>was</emph> India—and that she was to send him
word whether she found Nara well and happy.
She added that Horsford mentioned that he con-
templated coming to Calcutta, where he would
probably remain some time.</p>

<p>This was enough for the imaginative, emotional
girl. She pondered over what <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mowatt had
told her. She never slept that night. The one
craving of her soul must be satisfied, but how it
was to be done—how she was to reach the land
of her birth, where was the man she hungered for—
she did not know nor did she trouble. She felt sure
she would find a way. The next morning she was
missing, and she presented herself to her aunt,
indifferent to remonstrances and upbraidings.</p>

<p><q>So far as I can see all you can do is to dress
hair—<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Granger says something about that in
her letter—also that you're skilful in embroider-
ing and other fancy-work. These seem really to be
the qualifications for a lady's maid. Is it your
intention to seek a post of that kind?</q> inquired
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton sarcastically, having apparently
derived inspiration from the sepulchral vases.</p>

<p><q>I don't know. I've not thought about it.</q></p>

<p><q>Exactly. You haven't thought. I doubt if
you ever <emph>do</emph> think. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Granger also adds that
she surprised you one night performing an out-
<pb n="168"/>
rageous dance for the edification of the young ladies
sleeping in the same room. Do you contemplate
going on the stage?</q></p>

<p>Nara remembered that night well. It was in-
tensely hot; the windows were made to open only
a little way at the top, and no one could sleep. A
sudden desire to revive memories of her young
days, curiosity to satisfy herself that she had not
forgotten her dancing, seized her. While she was
circling, waving her arms, gliding and pausing and
keeping time to the wild melody she was humming,
the girls looking on, their eyes strained with wonder
and almost with fear, the door slowly opened, and
in marched <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Granger, accompanied by the
head governess, horror written in their eyes. For
a week the culprit was not permitted to associate
with the rest of the girls.</p>

<p><q>Well, you don't give me any answer?</q> went
on Aunt Lavinia acidly. <q>Is the theatre your
aim?</q></p>

<p><q>No—no—no. I want nothing except to go
back to my own country,</q> cried Nara, for the first
time a little agitated.</p>

<p><q>Oh, well, it would be the best thing, no doubt,
but——</q> <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton stopped. There came
a tap at the door, and a servant entered, bearing a
salver with a card.</p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod,</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, looking
at the card. <q>Oh, yes, I <emph>am</emph> at home. I'll see
her here, Parsons. You'd better go, Nara. I'll
talk with you later on.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod, a little woman, thin and energetic,
excessively flounced and bustled and ringleted, was
shown in and greeted the General's wife effusively.</p>

<pb n="169"/>
<p><q>Dear <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, how well you're looking!
I'm so glad, because I want you and the General
to dine with us to-morrow night. I do hope neither
you nor General Brampton is engaged. The notice
is shockingly short, but I couldn't help myself.
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum's returning to India this week, and
to-morrow's the only evening she has to spare. I
do so want you to meet her. She's tremendously
rich—married Andrew Meldrum, who made a big
fortune in indigo or cotton or something. They
were married before I left Simla. I was at the
wedding—everything most <foreign xml:lang="fr">recherché</foreign>. She was
one of the prettiest girls in Simla, and excepting
that her figure's more set and she's a little stouter
I don't see much difference. Now you must come.
I positively won't take any refusal.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't remember that I've any engagement,</q>
rejoined <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, in her slow, impressive
way, when she had a chance to speak. <q>No, I
don't think I have. Of course I can't answer for
the General.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, you must persuade him. I'm sure he'll
put off anything, if it's not very important,
to oblige <emph>you</emph>. It was so fortunate my meeting
with Clare Meldrum. I was in the Row this
afternoon and saw a lady in a landau looking very
hard at me, and I recognised her at once. She's
in England for a visit, and would have extended
her stay, but her husband's lying ill at Delhi, and
she's anxious to get back to nurse him. I was
very glad to hear her say this, because I don't
think the marriage was a particularly happy one.
Indeed, there were rumours of a separation. To
tell the truth, they weren't well matched; she
<pb n="170"/>
must be at least five-and-twenty years younger
than her husband.</q></p>

<p><q>I hope there was no—ahem—scandal,</q> said
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, wrinkling her brows.</p>

<p><q>Oh, dear no, not the slightest. I should
<emph>never</emph> think of inviting <emph>you</emph> to meet her, dear
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, had there been anything of <emph>that</emph>
kind.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm very glad. I was constantly hearing of
such dreadful things when I was in India. The
deception one met with was shocking—women
passing themselves off as respectable when all
the while they were anything but what they ought
to be. I had to be most particular, and I'm glad
to say <emph>I</emph> was never deceived.</q></p>

<p>This opening was enough for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod, who
revelled in searching for skeletons in the family
cupboard and in rattling their bones. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Brampton's horror of meeting with people tainted
with scandal did not extend to hearing about
them, and she was greatly entertained by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Ormerod's vivacious narratives.</p>

<p>Suddenly came a deadly thrust. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton
had always been affable towards <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod,
but in a superior, condescending way befitting the
proper attitude of a general's wife towards the
wife of a mere major, notwithstanding that the
latter had inherited a small fortune and had sold
out of the army in consequence. The conversation,
gave the Major's lady the opportunity of paying
off old scores, and she was too sharp and too spiteful
to let the chance slip.</p>

<p><q>Talking of scandals, what has become of your
niece—poor Captain Folliott's daughter? Guy
<pb n="171"/>
Horsford shipped her to England for you to take
care of, didn't he?</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton reddened with anger. How dare
a major's wife talk so coarsely? It was true Nara
<emph>was</emph> her niece. Though the girl's mother was a
native woman the relationship could not be
denied. But to speak of her as being <soCalled>shipped</soCalled>
as though she were a bale of bandanas or a case
of curry-powder! It was annoying enough to
be aunt to an Eurasian, but to have the fact
known in Simla and be gossiped about—Captain
Horsford must have been terribly indiscreet—was
inexpressibly galling.</p>

<p><q>I beg your pardon, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod,</q> said she
freezingly, <q>but there is no scandal connected with
my brother or my brother's child.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm very glad indeed to hear it. The reputation
of Nautch girls is so questionable that it's quite
refreshing to come across an exception to the
general rule. Of course <emph>you</emph> would know the true
story of Captain Folliott and the girl he fell in
love with, so it's very clear that rumour as usual
has been fathering falsehoods.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton's fat seemed suddenly to turn
to jelly. She shook from head to foot. What
was the rumour <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod alluded to with
unmistakable satisfaction? <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton really
knew nothing about Nara beyond what Captain
Horsford had written. The Resident, it is true,
replied to her letter, but it was little more than a
formal acknowledgment. He could learn nothing
about Captain Folliott's private affairs, but he
promised to make further inquiries. However,
he never wrote again, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton tried
<pb n="172"/>
to make the best of the matter. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod's
allusion to Nautch girls was an ugly coincidence,
taken in connection with Nara's escapade in the
bedroom. It sent her hot and cold.</p>

<p><q>Falsehoods,</q> she repeated, but not in the
confident tone in which she had uttered the
word <q>scandal.</q> <q>Yes, no doubt. I should
like to hear the nature of the rumour you refer
to, so that I may give it an emphatic denial.</q></p>

<p><q>There's nothing really <emph>very</emph> bad—that is, to
those who know what things in India are like. And
I don't think it can be said that the rumour's
been widely circulated. The truth is the matter
was hushed up—for some reason concerning Cap-
tain Horsford, I believe. It's a pity the story
wasn't told openly. People are always ready
to imagine things, aren't they? <emph>I</emph> happen to be
acquainted with the details because the Major
told me—under a bond of secrecy, of course. But
really here in England I don't see why the same
secrecy should be observed. I think if you don't
know the version of the affair that's been whispered
about in Simla, that it would be a kindness to tell
you. But mind, I don't vouch for its truth.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton resigned herself with the air of
a martyr to listen to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod's narrative,
which was nothing more than a <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">résumé</foreign> of the
story of the episode at the Rajah of Dakhur's
Palace, the disappearance of the dancing-girl, the
suspicion that Horsford was the abductor, and
that the girl herself was Jack Folliott's daughter.</p>

<p><q>All this is news to me. I think Captain Hors-
ford behaved shamefully in not telling me <emph>every-
thing,</emph></q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, much agitated. <q>He
<pb n="173"/>
wrote that the girl's mother was connected with
the Royal family of Delhi. Is that true or false?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, it's very likely to be the case. I've no
doubt there are any number of so-called princes
and princesses in Delhi. I doubt if the old Kings
knew what morality was. It's dreadful to think of,
and all we in England can do is to shut our eyes.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton was quite willing to be blind,
but she could not shut out the unpleasant fact
that she had been brought into personal contact
with the manners and customs and the lax morality
of India. She would have contradicted <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Ormerod if she could, but in her heart she quite
agreed with the Major's wife. In view of what
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton had just heard Nara's dancing
freak at the school became of very serious import.
It was certainly confirmatory of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod's
story. The horrible thought darted into <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Brampton's mind that if some of Nara's early in-
stincts and training could be revived after lying
dormant for some five years there was no reason
why others should not burst out. Those dreamy
eyes—oh, they were not given to the girl for
nothing.</p>

<p>One point <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod had left unsettled.
Indeed she had not alluded to it. Yet it was of
the utmost importance from <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton's
point of view. She hardly liked to discuss such a
shocking thing as marital relations unsanctified
by the Church, but it had to be done.</p>

<p><q>Married? Of course not,</q> exclaimed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Ormerod, with a contemptuous sniff. <q>Captain
Folliott would not have been such a fool. Why
should he be? As for the girl, who no doubt was
<pb n="174"/>
infatuated, what did she care about our marriage
service?</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton's heart fell. She had not a
word to say in opposition to this obvious truth.</p>

<p><q>But,</q> she faltered, <q>I expressly mentioned
the matter in my second letter to the Resident in
reply to his formal acknowledgment of my first.</q></p>

<p><q>And what did he say?</q></p>

<p><q>I've never had any answer. He promised to
make further inquiries, but I've not had a line
from him since.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p><q>No doubt he knew your views on such matters,
and did not want to distress you. There's only
one place where a Church of England marriage
could take place in Delhi, and that is old Colonel
Skinner's church—<abbr>St.</abbr> James', you know. Of
course a register of some kind is kept, and the
Resident could have consulted it. I dare say he
did and found no record. Not likely he would.
I doubt if any clergyman would have solemnised
such a ridiculous union. The girl, you know, was
a common dancer.</q></p>

<p><q>A common dancer!</q> repeated <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bramp-
ton, aghast.</p>

<p><q>So George told me. I can't think there was
any marriage according to our religion. And as
for hers—well, that was impossible unless Captain
Folliott became a Mahommedan.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod——</q> gasped <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bramp-
ton faintly. <q>Don't!</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod was satisfied. She had taken
down the General's wife sufficiently, and was now
prepared to extend her sympathy.</p>

<pb n="175"/>
<p><q>Captain Horsford's to blame for all this
trouble. He had no right whatever to meddle in
a matter which didn't concern him. At all events,
having found the girl he ought not to have
shifted his responsibility on to your shoulders,
and especially without a word of explanation as
to the true state of the case. I call it disgraceful.
He might have given you the chance of saying
what you would do.</q></p>

<p><q>Exactly,</q> moaned <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton. <q>Do you
suppose for one moment that I should have re-
ceived the girl into my house if I'd known what
you now tell me? Under the shocking circum-
stances I can't see that she's any relative of
mine.</q></p>

<p><q>You're quite right. At all events, she hasn't
the slightest claim on you.</q></p>

<p><q>I feel strongly inclined to write to Captain
Horsford and tell him my mind. Where is he
now?</q></p>

<p><q>In Pegu. He went with General Godwin to
Rangoon, and after the capitulation of the Burmese
he obtained some post in connection with the
administration of Pegu. No doubt a letter would
reach him, but would it do much good? How old
is the girl?</q></p>

<p><q>She must be seventeen, I should think.</q></p>

<p><q>Still at school?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, no,</q> returned <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, with an
apologetic cough. <q>At this moment she's in the
house. She only arrived this afternoon, quite
unexpectedly. So far as I can make out, there
was an upset between her and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Granger, and
she took herself off. Practically she ran away.</q></p>

<pb n="176"/>
<p><q>Dear, dear! I'm afraid there's trouble in store
for you, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton. What sort of girl is
she?</q></p>

<p><q>You can see her if you like. I should be only
too grateful if you could suggest any way out of
the difficulty. She herself wants to go back to
India, but I can hardly send her at random, so
to speak.</q></p>

<p><q>I dare say she'd tumble on her feet. Head-
strong girls generally manage to pull through their
difficulties.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know that she's headstrong. She's
quiet and apparently submissive, but that, I think,
must be slyness. However, you shall see her.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton rang the bell, gave her instructions
to Parsons, and in a minute or so Nara entered.</p>

<p>Nara, as Aunt Lavinia said, was seventeen. All
the angularities, the disproportions of twelve had
disappeared. The change was marvellous, both
in figure and face. The soft harmony of budding
womanhood marked the first, a mystic beauty
lurked in the curves of the second. That beauty
was elusive. It flashed upon one in the rare mo-
ments of animation, it vanished as quickly, leaving
behind the suggestion of coldness, but a coldness
which one felt instinctively was but a mask.</p>

<p>The complexion was of the pallor of her early
days, but the olive tinge was not so pronounced.
It was clear, with an even creaminess of tint,
broken only by the scarlet of the lips. The mouth
was less mobile, it was not so ready to pout, not
so eager to smile. The restraint imposed upon
her by artificial and uncongenial surroundings for
the last five years, the continual repression of her
<pb n="177"/>
natural impulses, the stifling of her cravings for
liberty and independence, had given firmness to
the upper lip. Maybe the same causes had
accentuated the bold contour of the chin.</p>

<p>The slight irregularity of the characteristic eye-
brows was the same, the eyes themselves had not
altered, save to become more expressive, more
luminous when she chose to make them so. The
long, dark, sweeping lashes had the old habit of
drooping unexpectedly, provoking to the male
gazer, but irresistibly fascinating.</p>

<p>Most of the girls at Lanfear House said this
drooping of the eyelashes meant craft, but then
the girls were not particularly drawn towards Nara.
Though she was among them she was not of
them. As an under-teacher she was a hopeless
failure. Her orders were treated with contempt.
But after her weird, fantastic dance the girls altered
in their demeanour. They shunned her, not
because of dislike, but because of a strange fear
with which she had inspired them. She had
never lost her soft, Indian pronunciation of
certain words; she still retained little tricks of
manner, fascinating and indescribable. Even if
she had not suggested the East in her face, one
would never have taken her to be English.</p>

<p>After she entered the room she stood in perfect
ease and grace of attitude, awaiting what her aunt
had to say. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton did not introduce
her to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod, but went on to examine her
as to her capabilities, carefully avoiding, however,
all reference to her dancing accomplishments, and
when the good lady had come to the end of her
questions Nara was dismissed.</p>

<pb n="178"/>
<p><q>Well, what do you think of her?</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Brampton.</p>

<p><q>She's very handsome—strikingly so. You'll
have to be very careful where men are concerned,</q>
was <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod's opinion.</p>

<p><q>That's just what troubles me. Edgar will be
home next week. His term at Addiscombe's
over, and he'll stay with us until he's commis-
sioned. I wouldn't have the girl in the house
while he's here on any account.</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly not. She's just the girl a lad would
go mad over. Besides, the position of cousins is
a dangerous sort of relationship. It permits a
certain amount of familiarity which——</q></p>

<p><q>Edgar doesn't know she's his cousin,</q> hastily
interposed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, reddening slightly. <q>I
never meant that they should meet. I had
planned out her career, and when she was in a
position to earn her own living I intended to re-
nounce any claim she might have upon me Now
that I know more about her I'm the more con-
vinced of my prudence in not acknowledging her
before the world.</q></p>

<p><q>Does she know that you're her aunt?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes—thanks to Captain Horsford's unpar-
donable presumption. This makes it all the more
imperative that she and my boy shouldn't meet.
Now, can you suggest anything? Of course she
must take a situation. What do you think she's
fit for?</q></p>

<p><q>Upon my word, I don't know. She doesn't
seem to have learned very much. You tell me
she can only play the piano a little, and I expect
her singing's shrill and harsh, like that of most of
<pb n="179"/>
the girls of India. She owned she was very back-
ward in her French, and she couldn't answer the
simple questions in arithmetic and English history
you put to her. She's not qualified in the least
to be a private governess, and what other occupa-
tion is there for girls? Even if she were better
educated, I'm sure she'd have a difficulty in
obtaining a post. It would be positively dangerous
to engage her where there are grown-up sons. A
mother is bound to be very careful about the
young women she has to live in the house.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course—of course. You heard what she
said about her needlework, and her skill in dress-
ing hair? Well now, I've been thinking that she
might go as lady's-maid. Her manners are quiet
and respectful, and as for her good looks, well,
they're no detriment, in a menial capacity.</q></p>

<p><q>You've no objection, then, to her going out
to service?</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton winced, but soon recovered
herself.</p>

<p><q>Not under the circumstances. I can't bring
myself to think the girl's any relative of mine.
She knows my sentiments perfectly well, and if
there's no way of getting her back to India, why
she must take whatever situation may be open
to her in England. Have her in the house I will
<emph>not</emph>.</q></p>

<p><q>I wonder if <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum could be persuaded
into engaging her?</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod, after a
pause.</p>

<p><q>Oh, I should be so thankful if she could,</q>
exclaimed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p><q>Clare's return to India was unexpected. She
<pb n="180"/>
mayn't have engaged any maid. This girl—what
did you call her?</q></p>

<p><q>Nara—Captain Horsford wrote some rubbish
about her being descended from Jahanara, one of the
princesses of Delhi two hundred years or so ago.
Whether this is true or no doesn't matter now.
What <emph>does</emph> matter, dear <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod, is that
Nara must only be known as my <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">protégée</foreign>. On
no account should <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum be told Captain
Horsford's story.</q></p>

<p><q>You may trust me—implicitly. I quite under-
stand your delicate and painful position. But
won't it be necessary to caution Nara herself?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I'll do that,</q> rejoined <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton
quickly. <q>Between ourselves, I don't think the
girl's anxious to own her English relations. The
influence of her mother's race is far too strong.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well. I shall be meeting <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum
to-night, and I'll sound her on the subject.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank you—thank you. You can't think how
grateful I shall be if you can settle the affair
satisfactorily. When I see a favourable oppor-
tunity of talking to the General about the little
matter you mentioned some time ago you may be
sure I shall not miss it.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod went away quite satisfied with
her afternoon's work. She had been severely
snubbed by the General's wife some weeks before,
when she had asked her to persuade the General
to say a good word for her brother, a subaltern
who had been waiting in vain for promotion, but
now that she had the lady under her thumb she

<head type="main">Andrew Meldrum's Letter</head>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod, anxious to oblige the General's
wife, at once posted off to Claridge's Hotel, where
Clare was staying, and in her gushing, positive
way described Nara as the very girl to suit her
if she were wanting a lady's-maid. Clare listened
graciously, for a maid who was clever was exactly
what she wanted, but when she heard Nara was
an Eurasian she shrugged her shoulders contemp-
tuously.</p>

<p><q>I'd much rather have a native of pure blood.
You're prepared then for the kind of nature
you'll have to deal with, but the children of
mixed parentage are always uncertain. You
know as well as I do, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod, that they're
despised, both by their own people as well as
by ours.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, of course that's true, but why not engage
her for the journey only?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, it would be the safer plan.</q> Clare paused
and went on with languid indifference: <q>Who
are her people? Do you know who was her
father? A private, I suppose.</q></p>

<p><q>I expect so. Anyhow, I know he was in the
<pb n="182"/>
army, but no doubt <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton will tell you
everything.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, it's not of the least consequence. If the
girl doesn't suit me I can get rid of her.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course,</q> echoed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod. <q>Well,
you and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton can talk over the matter
when you meet at my house to-morrow night.
<foreign xml:lang="fr">Au revoir</foreign>, dear,</q> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod whisked her
flounces and her bustle out of the room.</p>

<p>Clare rose from her chair and walking slowly to
the window looked out into the dreary respec-
tability of Brook Street. The light was waning
and the gas-lamps were unlit. Her vacant eyes
rested on the traffic, but it was doubtful if she saw
anything. Then she wheeled round abruptly
and paced the room for a few minutes. Finally
she rang the bell for the gas to be lighted and
drew a letter from her pocket.</p>

<p>The letter had arrived that morning, yet she had
not broken the seal. She told herself impatiently
that the contents would be certain to irritate
her and completely spoil the day's shopping on
which her mind was bent. But irritating or
not, the letter must be read, for it was from
her husband.</p>

<p>It was hard to say whether Clare's marriage
had improved her or the reverse. When she was
animated she was quite as pretty as in the days
of her maidenhood, and five years had not made
her look a day older. Her figure perhaps was
more developed, and she no longer suggested a
Dresden china shepherdess, but put her in the
appropriate dress and she might have stepped out
of a Watteau group. She had the full, ample
<pb n="183"/>
bust, the symmetrically curved shoulders, and
the round and slender waist which Boucher and
painters of his school delighted in. The daintiness
and grace of every movement somehow did not
belong to the conventional idea of the married
woman such as she was pictured in the 'fifties.
Caps had not then ceased to be the distinguishing
mark of the married state, but Clare would never
consent to disfigure herself and hide her beautiful
hair by following the vile fashion. When she
went shopping she was invariably addressed as
<q>Miss.</q></p>

<p>Against these improvements had to be set a
certain hardness of voice and manner. She was
not quite so ready to please and be pleased. She
had <soCalled>moods</soCalled> without any assignable cause.
When her face was in repose it somehow seemed
to lose its charm. Indeed, there were times when
it looked as if she had gone through a tempest of
passion. But such moments of self-betrayal were
very rare, and if the company pleased her and she
was in good form, she could be almost as fresh
and as gay and as fascinating as in the old days
at Simla.</p>

<p>Her expression now as she dragged the letter
from the envelope was anything but fresh and
fascinating. It was that of a long-continued strain
on her nerves which was becoming almost beyond
endurance. Her contracted brows, her compressed
lips and dilated nostrils indicated the efforts she
was making to restrain an outburst of emotion.
However, she forced herself to read the letter
from beginning to end without comment.</p>

<p>The letter was one which would have angered
<pb n="184"/>
a much less sensitive and high-spirited woman.
It began coldly.</p>

<p><q>Clare,</q></p>

<p><q>My patience is becoming exhausted. Why
do you ignore my repeated requests to you to
return home? Why do you treat me as though
I were an entire stranger? What is the reason
you stay in Europe when your place is by the
side of your husband? You know I have re-
peatedly asked you to tell me what complaints
you have against me, and I've never had a
satisfactory answer. You are driving me mad
with your coldness and caprice; yet I believe
I could endure both if you were with me. I
cannot endure your absence. You are never out
of my mind, and I am constantly imagining all
kinds of ugly things, quite without any founda-
tion, I am sure. People tell me I'm looking ill,
but my looks are of no importance, and I can
brush aside questions on <emph>that</emph> subject, but not those
relating to <emph>you</emph>. Our friends are beginning to
talk about your being away so long, and I don't
know what to say. You went to Europe eighteen
months ago on account of your health—so you
said—but in the letters you have sent at very rare
intervals you say nothing concerning yourself.
I was anxious about you and asked your uncle to
tell me if he thought there was anything radically
wrong in your constitution, and he laughed at
the idea.</q></p>

<p><q>I've racked my brains, Clare to discover a
cause for your extraordinary conduct. I have
never grumbled at your extravagance; I held my
<pb n="185"/>
tongue when I discovered you had been betting,
and I paid your losses. I don't suppose you know
this, and I sometimes think that your reason for
leaving Delhi was because you could not discharge
your <soCalled>debts of honour.</soCalled> If that were so, there's
nothing to prevent you returning at once. I have
never inquired what you did with the money you
were constantly drawing from your settlement,
and I don't inquire now, but I imagine from what
I have heard that you have not very much left.
It seems to me that your only grievance is that I
objected to your going out so much, but I had a
right to object. I had so little of your society
and companionship. You resented my remon-
strances and flatly refused to obey me. I made a
terrible mistake when I married you, yet I swear
to you that the way you have acted has not
weakened my love for you, and I am puzzled at my
own feelings and at what I suppose you would call
my weakness. You have been a bitter disappoint-
ment. I looked for a companion and have found
a well-dressed, beautiful doll.</q></p>

<p><q>When I commenced this letter I did not intend
to write so strongly, and I had thoughts of tearing
it up and sending another. But it is the truth, and
it is time you should know what I think. Yet
though every word has been wrung from me I am
willing to forget and forgive if you will return.
I don't think you realise my character. If you
make me your enemy you will repent it. For God's
sake don't turn my love into hate. I can say no
more now. I await your answer.</q></p>

<p><q>Andrew Meldrum,</q></p>

<p><q>Your husband.</q></p>

<pb n="186"/>
<p>When Clare reached the end of the letter she
quivered with rage. The last two words, <q>your
husband,</q> she interpreted as a reminder of an
unpleasant fact which he chose to assume she had
forgotten. As if she could ever forget it! Did
not her position rankle every day of her life?</p>

<p><q>My answer!</q> she burst out. <q>Shall I answer
his letter at all? Well, I'm not sorry he's thrown
down the gauntlet. An open rupture's better
than continual nagging and chafing under restraint.
What complaint have I against him? Why, if
he were not so stony and unimaginative he would
see at once. My complaint is that he is Andrew
Meldrum and—I'm a well-dressed doll! What did
he expect? It might have been worse. He might
have married a doll who was <emph>not</emph> well-dressed.</q></p>

<p>Her anger gradually cooled. She was not blind
to the fact that her husband was justified in writing
as he did. She had behaved badly; yet not so
badly as her conduct on the surface appeared.
When she married Meldrum it was with the in-
tention of adapting herself to her new life. She
gradually found the task impossible. Perhaps if
they had not toured in Europe for their honey-
moon things might have gone smoother, and even-
tually they might have settled down into something
like a compromise. But the nature of the honey-
moon gave them too much of each other's society.
Certainly Clare had too much of her husband's.
She could not get away from him, and she had to
have his irritable moods as well as his amiable
ones.</p>

<p>Continental travelling in the fifties undoubtedly
tried one's temper. Meldrum, used all his life
<pb n="187"/>
to instant obedience, found himself continually at
loggerheads with railway officials and major-domos
of hotels, whose language he understood very im-
perfectly. He was never irritable with Clare, but
she had the backwash of his irritability with
others. Her experience of life had been so easy-
going, she had had such little acquaintance with
the despotic ways of India, and had never seen
her philosophic uncle out of temper with any-
thing, that her husband's outbursts over what
she looked upon as the veriest trifles came upon
her as an unpleasant awakening. She was heartily
glad in one sense to get back to India, and in
another she was filled with dismal forebodings;
her life promised to be so thoroughly prosaic.
Meldrum, of course, had to leave her at times, but
not so often as she hoped. He had made his
<soCalled>pile</soCalled> and had taken a partner to do the active
work of the business. His intention before he
was married was to retire and live in Europe, but
the fatal honeymoon trip had made him alter his
mind. He was too used to India and Indian
ways to be able to adapt himself to those of any
other country.</p>

<p>This alteration of plans would have made no
difference to Clare provided her husband had not
looked after her so closely and jealously. She re-
sented being questioned, although Meldrum was
always careful to say he wished her to do as she
pleased; and out of bravado, and to satisfy her
craving for excitement, she plunged into betting
and lost heavily, and, unfortunately, to the
dandified and vicious Lawton, whom she detested.
The inevitable happened when she could not pay.
<pb n="188"/>
On Lawton's advances being rejected, he threa-
tened her not with blackmail, but with revenge—
exposure of her recklessness to her husband.</p>

<p>She would not have cared for his threat had it
not meant giving Meldrum an advantage over her,
which her pride could not brook. She had not
the courage to go through the ordeal, and she
invented an indisposition for which the only
remedy was a change of climate. Andrew Meldrum
would have insisted upon going with her but for
the changes which were impending in the govern-
ment of Oudh, brought about by Lord Dalhousie.
Meldrum's trade with Lucknow was very large,
and he did not know what would happen after the
deposition of the King. So Clare went by herself
to Europe.</p>

<p>In a fever of restlessness Clare had travelled
from city to city in the endeavour to occupy her
mind and keep it from dwelling on the fetters she
had voluntarily put on. Though she had married
Andrew Meldrum she never ceased to think of
Guy Horsford. She had heard of him through
friends of officers engaged in the expedition to
Burma, and times out of number had bitterly
reproached herself for her haste in accepting
Meldrum.</p>

<p>The autumn of 1856 arrived. She had been
away from Delhi over a year, and might not have
had it in her mind to go back but for a paragraph
she had happened to notice in an Indian paper
she took up by chance in the dining-room of the
hotel. It simply told, among other military
changes, that Captain, now Colonel Horsford, had
resigned his appointment in Pegu and was about
<pb n="189"/>
to return to India. These few words concentrated
her scattered ideas. If she went back to Delhi
her intense longing to see Horsford once more
might be gratified. There could be no harm
either in seeing him or speaking to him. She was
quite sure she could trust herself.</p>

<p>Andrew Meldrum's angry, reproachful letter
came at an inopportune moment. To be told to
do a thing was enough to make her <emph>not</emph> want to
do it. For a little time she hovered between
submission and her passionate yearning for the
man she loved. Being a woman she discovered a
compromise.</p>

<p><q>I'll go back, but I won't answer Andrew's
letter. He can think what he likes.</q></p>

<p>She was about to tear the letter into fragments
when she paused and locked it in her desk instead.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day she was absent and
absorbed. She had promised to go to the Hay-
market Theatre with some friends and she fulfilled
her engagement, but Buckstone's quaint humour
failed to interest her, and the laughter of the
audience sounded strangely in her ears. By the
following evening, when the Ormerods' guests sat
down to dinner, she had forgotten the matter of
the Eurasian lady's-maid, and the conversation at
the dinner table drove it further from her mind.</p>

<p>General Brampton, a lean, lantern-jawed, yellow-
faced man, whose liver made him pessimistic, had
spent three-parts of his life in India, and though
he had retired from the Company's service ten
years before he never took kindly to England, and
he rarely talked of anything but Indian affairs and
the old days of <q>John Company,</q> in whose rule
<pb n="190"/>
he firmly believed. He regarded the efforts made
in 1853 to transfer its power to the Government
in England with great misgiving, and he held
that though nominally, with certain modifications,
the rule was permitted to remain in the Company's
hands, it was the beginning of the end.</p>

<p><q>Mark my words,</q> said he. <q>The severance
of the old friendly relations between the great
chiefs of India and the Company's officials will
lead to great distrust. Many will come to believe
that the new policy of the British Government
will mean new annexations. The Company has
always acted in the spirit of <q>benevolent des-
potism,</q> and this is the kind of government the
natives thoroughly understand. If you tell me
it means keeping things pleasant with the assist-
ance of doles, pensions, and grants I'm not going
to contradict you. Some of you new men call
this kind of thing <q>bribery.</q> Well, all I've got
to say it's the custom of the country and you
can't easily get away from it. I don't agree with
Lord Dalhousie's forward policy, but, by gad! sir,
he was right in urging the Court of Directors and
the ministry to permit the King of Oudh to retain
his sovereignty.</q></p>

<p><q>But, sir, <choice><corr>Shah</corr><orig>Shad</orig></choice> Wajid Ali was a dissolute,
tyrannical scoundrel,</q> objected Major Ormerod.</p>

<p><q>What then? The people of India were used
to rulers of that kind. It was only when our men
of <soCalled>advanced opinions,</soCalled> as they're called, came
along with their schemes of reform and their ideas
of governing India on European principles that
Oudh began to be discontented. Why couldn't
Oudh be treated as Delhi was some fifty years ago?
<pb n="191"/>
Bahadah Shah is still a King—without much
power, it is true, but what does that matter?
Sentiment is preserved, and that's everything in
India. Anyhow, the policy's worked well hitherto,
but how long it's going to continue is another
matter. I suppose you know what's going on in
Delhi, Major Ormerod?</q></p>

<p><q>You mean Lord Canning's determination to
dispossess the King of his Palace and to take it
over on military considerations?</q></p>

<p><q>That's just what I do mean. Lord Dalhousie
wanted the same thing, but the directors were so
strongly opposed that he let it alone. The Court
consulted me on the subject, and I told them that
if they wanted to stir up a hornets' nest they
couldn't do better than take Lord Dalhousie's
advice. However, Lord Dalhousie gave way, and
lo and behold, the first thing Lord Canning does
after taking office last February is to carry into
effect what his predecessor was reluctant to do.
Lookers-on see most of the game, and some of
the letters I've received from private sources are
almost alarming.</q></p>

<p><q>I quite agree with you, sir,</q> said Ormerod.
<q>If we escape a row in Delhi we shall be lucky,
and as usual it will be the woman in the case—I
beg your pardon, ladies,</q> broke off the Major,
with an apologetic bow to Clare.</p>

<p><q>Oh, please go on,</q> she exclaimed laughingly.
<q>Our unfortunate sex always has had the credit
of being at the bottom of every mischief. Eve
set the fashion, Adam sheltered himself behind
her, and I suppose human nature was made that
way. But, Major, we won't quarrel over what
<pb n="192"/>
can't be helped. I'm dying to know more about
Delhi and the interesting woman. Who is she?</q></p>

<p>Major Ormerod had seen too much of Clare's
moods before she was married not to recognise
the note of sarcasm in her voice. It was doubt-
ful, however, whether any of the rest did. They
only detected light, harmless raillery.</p>

<p><q>The woman, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum, is Zeenut Mehal,
Bahadur Shah's youngest and favourite wife.
Perhaps you had an opportunity of seeing her
when you were living in your Delhi house. A
mere man, of course, would never have such a
privilege.</q></p>

<p><q>I saw her once. She did not seem to me to
be particularly young. She has what, I believe,
is called a strong face. I should think if she set
her mind upon anything she'd get it.</q></p>

<p><q>By George, madam, you're right,</q> broke in
the old General. <q>The Begum's not one to take
things meekly. She governs the old King and
everybody about her. Lord Canning's laying
up trouble for himself. He not only means to
take possession of the Palace but he refuses to
recognise Zeenut Mehal's wishes to make Jewan
Bukht, her grandson, Bahadur Shah's successor,
in place of the eldest son. There'll be a fine
rumpus directly the old King dies. Zeenut Mehal's
preparing for it. The man who writes to me is
behind the scenes, and he tells me she's intriguing
everywhere, and especially in the Deccan and
Persia, to foster a hostile feeling against England.
And that's not the worst of it. It's pretty certain
she's joined hands with Seereek Dhundoo Punth,
old Bajee Rao's adopted son—I believe in Cawn-
<pb n="193"/>
pore he's known as Nana Sahib—who wants the
pension of £80,000 a year the Company granted
Bajee Rao when they deposed him. He was
Peishwa of Poonah, you know.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm glad the Company stood firm over that
piece of impudence. Dhundoo Punth doesn't
deserve 80,000 pence,</q> said Ormerod. <q>I don't
mean because he was the son of a poor corn-dealer
of Poonah, but because I believe him to be sly
and revengeful. I've heard he's frightfully savage
at the Company's refusal, and if Zeenut Mehal
joins her craft with his discontent they may
succeed in stirring up—I don't say rebellion, our
hold over the sepoys is too strong for <emph>that</emph>—but
trouble. I tell you what, sir, the man who's
most wanted in Delhi just now is Guy Horsford.
He speaks half a dozen dialects and knows Delhi
like a native. I'm glad to hear he's coming to
Calcutta. He'll be within reach if he's wanted,
anyhow.</q></p>

<p>The ladies pricked up their ears at the sound of
Horsford's name, but none of them said a word.
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton had her reasons for being silent;
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod, remembering her compact with the
General's wife, felt that her lips were sealed, and
Clare, though eager to hear more, was afraid to
show undue curiosity before the Ormerods.</p>

<p>General Brampton could have said something in
very forcible language about Horsford. Resenting
Horsford's interference, he was strongly against
his wife taking charge of Nara, and was all for
sending her back. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, however, con-
vinced him that the lesser of two evils was to keep
the girl and say as little as possible about her,
<pb n="194"/>
and grumpily he acquiesced. He declared, how-
ever, that he would never willingly see her, and he
gave orders that her name was never to be uttered
in his presence. So when Ormerod mentioned
Horsford approvingly his yellow skin took a
brickdust hue, and he spluttered out:</p>

<p><q>He'd better stop in Burma. I don't believe
in these fellows who are said to be indispensable.
I've seen something of 'em; more conceit than
work—that's <emph>my</emph> experience. What's he going to
do in Calcutta?</q></p>

<p><q>It's some post connected with re-organisation.
There are less troops in India now than ever
there were, thanks to the Crimea business, and
some people are a good deal worried about it.
Anyhow, the man who writes me says that Hors-
ford will be in Calcutta quite six months, and
then will go on to Delhi. That's the place Lord
Canning will do well to keep his eye upon. Delhi's
the hub of India.</q></p>

<p>The General gave a grunt of acquiescence, and
a convenient pause occurring, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod ex-
changed glances with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, and reading
approval in her eyes, rose, an example which was
followed by the other ladies. The gentlemen
were not sorry to be left alone to their port.</p>

<p><q>I'm very glad you gave me the signal,</q> whis-
pered the General's wife to her hostess. <q>I was
on thorns all the while your husband was talking
about Colonel Horsford, lest he should say any-
thing which would let out the unfortunate story
before <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, the Major's most discreet,</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Ormerod complacently. <q>I had to tell him, of
<pb n="195"/>
course, but he understood the position, and he
promised not to say a word. It was a pity he
introduced Horsford's name, but luckily no harm
was done. I saw the General was getting very
angry, and was quite afraid of an outburst.
Luckily the storm passed.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, indeed,</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton, with a
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>In the seclusion of the drawing-room <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Brampton opened to Clare the matter about which
she was so anxious. A load was taken off her
mind when Clare asked no questions, simply
saying that if the General's wife could vouch for
Nara's efficiency and honesty she would accept
the girl's services.</p>

<p><q>That's most kind of you,</q> returned <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Brampton gratefully. <q>But you haven't seen the
girl. Would you care to call on me and——</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I don't think that matters,</q> interrupted
Clare. <q>She can come to me to-morrow and
commence her duties. I may have to start earlier
than I expected.</q></p>

<div n="14" type="chapter">
<pb n="196"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="14">XIV</num></head>
<head type="main">Farewell to the West</head>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton was delighted that the trouble-
some business had been accomplished so easily.
The next morning she told Nara that she had
obtained a situation for her to wait upon a <q>very
nice lady</q> who was returning to India. The girl
did not fail to note the satisfaction with which the
announcement was made. Of course Aunt Lavinia
would be glad to get rid of her, but for this she
cared nothing. To think she was going back to
India was everything, and her eyes sparkled. In
spite of her desire to shift a disagreeable burden
from her shoulders, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton was not pleased
at Nara's evident delight, but she considered it
politic to say nothing. In talking over the matter
afterwards with the General she characterised
Nara's demeanour as <q>base ingratitude.</q></p>

<p>All the morning was spent in buying what was
necessary for the girl's outfit, and in the afternoon
came the farewell, accompanied by many solemn
admonitions.</p>

<p><q>Recollect, Nara,</q> said the lady impressively,
<q>all now depends upon yourself. I've tried to do
my duty by you, and should have continued to do
so, as far as it laid in my power, supposing you'd
<pb n="197"/>
elected to remain in England, but as you've
chosen your path I'm no longer responsible for
anything you may do. You'll have a good, kind
mistress, and you must try to please her. If
you're well behaved you'll probably be with her
many years, and your future will be quite safe.</q></p>

<p>Her future? Nara had thought of this many
times and with hopelessness. England to her was
so black and drear, so prim and artificial. She
pined for her own land, for its warmth, its gorgeous
colours, its picturesqueness and poetry, and—she
pined for the handsome Englishman who had
risked his life to rescue her from shame and cruelty.
She had often tried to picture his face, she had
treasured the remembrance of his kindly smile
and cheery voice. She had gazed furtively at the
men she had seen in England, but there was never
one, she thought, who looked so brave and kind
as Sahib Horsford. To serve him as his slave was
the wish of her heart. That would be happiness.</p>

<p>At last the final word was said, and Nara was
seated in a stuffy, noisy, jolting <soCalled>growler,</soCalled> its
floor strewn with ill-smelling, soddened straw.
To her the cab was typical of London as she always
seemed to have seen it—sordid, mean, comfort-
less, ugly, depressing. The air outside was murky;
a cold drizzle was falling. The bumping of the
cab on the uneven granite cubes of the roadway
and the deafening rattle, were intolerable, but filled
with exultation at the thought that it was for the
last time she did not heed her surroundings. The
only time she was disturbed was in Oxford Street,
when the traffic was blocked by a flock of be-
wildered sheep and a herd of irritated cattle. The
<pb n="198"/>
yells of the drovers armed with spiked goads,
the bleating, the bellowing, the barking of dogs,
and the growls of angry coachmen, carmen, and
cabdrivers did not trouble her; it was the delay
she could not endure.</p>

<p>But all came to an end; the cab reached Brook
Street and drew up in front of the sedate hotel,
and in another five minutes Nara was face to face
with the lady whom for some time to come she
was to look upon as her mistress. The first glance
on both sides was one of indifference. In the
second curiosity was aroused, to be followed by a
feeling of antagonism, so slight and so subtle that
neither could say she was conscious of it.</p>

<p>Clare's reasons for hostility—if her feelings
could be so crystallised—were fairly easy to define.
She expected the average Eurasian fairer, pos-
sibly, than the pure-blooded native, and with the
subdued, furtive look characteristic of the half-
breed girl, as though she acknowledged she had no
place on the earth and deprecated her existence.
There was none of this serf-like aspect about Nara.
Immediately her eyes fell on the dainty figure, full
of grace despite the uncompromising corset, the
inartistic flounces, the hideous bustle, she involun-
tarily drew herself up with a pride of demeanour
as pronounced as that of the fair Englishwoman.</p>

<p>Clare was seated at a writing-table when Nara
entered. Quite a minute went over before she
spoke, her somewhat hard, bluish-grey eyes mean-
while scrutinising the girl closely.</p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton did not tell me your name.
What is it?</q></p>

<p><q>Nara.</q></p>

<pb n="199"/>
<p>An Englishwoman who had never been in India
would probably have asked <q>Nara—what?</q> Not
so Clare; she had never troubled about the names
of natives, and to her it did not matter whether a
man or a woman was called by one or half a dozen.</p>

<p><q>You'd better go to my rooms,</q> said she.
<q>You'll find Fifine, my French maid, there. She
knows you're coming, and she'll instruct you in your
duties. I'm told you haven't had much experience.</q></p>

<p><q>No——</q> Then suddenly remembering her
aunt's admonitions, she added hastily the word
<q>Ma'am.</q></p>

<p><q>That doesn't matter so long as you're willing
to learn. You can go.</q></p>

<p>Nara glided from the room. She easily found her
way to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum's apartments, a suite of three,
one of which was fitted up as a boudoir. Fifine
was the usual lady's-maid, cringing or pert, as
circumstances demanded. As she had refused to
accompany her mistress to India there was no
question of being supplanted by Nara, and she
received the girl with affable condescension.
Mademoiselle was prepared to patronise the <q>black
girl</q>; and she was taken back when the <q>black</q>
proved to be a shade fairer than herself. Her
English was somewhat imperfect, and Nara's French
was not much better, but they got on fairly well.</p>

<p>Clare was going to the opera that night. A
state function of some kind was on; it would be
the last night of pleasuring she would have in
England, and she intended to leave an impression
behind that would dwell in the memories of her
many admirers. On the whole she had had in
London what nowadays would be called a <q>good
<pb n="200"/>
time</q>; her husband's wealth had procured her
an <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">entrée</foreign> into some of the best and most exclusive
Anglo-Indian families, and the men were only too
glad to beau about so charming and fascinating a
lady. The fact that she was married added to
the attraction. To-night was to be a <q>send-off,</q>
again to quote the language of to-day.</p>

<p>The toilette was a most elaborate process.
Clare was inclined to be more fastidious and more
difficult to please than usual. She and Fifine had
long, anxious conferences over the selection of a
dress, and almost got to high words. At last the
important matter was settled, arid then came
another matter of even greater gravity—the dress-
ing of the hair. Dressing hair was the one accom-
plishment in which Fifine did not shine. She was
deft in dressmaking and millinery, for her youth
had been passed with a Parisian <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">modiste</foreign>, and she
was skilful in the art of <q>making up</q> the face,
but her attempts with hair were not effective,
and especially so to-night. Clare wanted a string
of pearls interwoven into her tawny tresses, the
whole to be surmounted by a comb ornamented
with diamonds. The lady declared angrily that
Fifine had made her look like a May Queen that
danced round a Jack-in-the-Green.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nara had done nothing but look on
from a distant corner. She was supposed to be
deriving benefit from watching Fifine's proceed-
ings. After the French maid's third failure with
the hair Clare turned sharply to Nara.</p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton said something about your
being clever at hairdressing. See what you can do.
This doesn't seem to be one of Fifine's good days.</q></p>

<pb n="201"/>
<p>Mademoiselle tossed her head, and flinging the
brush and comb on the toilet table she bounced
out of the room.</p>

<p><q>Impudent creature!</q> exclaimed the indignant
mistress. <q>She presumes because she's leaving. I
do believe she's made me look a fright on purpose.
You heard me tell Fifine what I wanted, didn't you?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, ma'am.</q></p>

<p><q>Come here, then; take down my hair and
do your best with it.</q></p>

<p>Nara emerged from the shadow into the light
of the wax candles each side of the toilet glass.
The toilet table was strewn with sparkling gems.
If Clare had one passion it was for jewellery, and
especially for diamonds. After she accepted
Andrew Meldrum he was continually bringing her
presents. Some were modern trinkets from Paris;
others were of Indian work, many of them exceed-
ingly rare and valuable. Nara gasped for breath,
partly because she, too, loved the glitter of gems,
and partly because the sight of the delicate and
intricate settings sent her memory back to the time
when Sundra Bai used to adorn her in preparation
for the dance. Whatever timidity she might have
felt at her first essay in her new vocation disappeared
in this vivid revival of the past.</p>

<p>The hair of the Indian dancing-girl is always
elaborately arranged, sometimes one way, some-
times another. Nara, owing to her European
father, was looked down upon by the other girls,
and put to wait upon them. In this way she
became expert in the art of hairdressing, and her
fingers had never lost their dexterity. To handle
Clare's soft, luxuriant, golden tresses was a supreme
<pb n="202"/>
pleasure. They lent themselves to manipulation
beneath her deft touch much readier than the
harsh, black locks of the girls of India. As the
gradual building of the edifice went on Clare
watched the progress in the glass and her dis-
satisfied expression gradually softened into com-
placency. Nara had arranged her hair to set off
her beauty to the best advantage. The design
was quaint and unorthodox. It was bound to
attract, and that, with Clare, was everything. But
the triumph was the cunning intermingling of the
jewels. Though Clare had her eyes fixed on the
girl's nimble ringers she could not completely
follow their movements. The effect of the whole
was novel and effective. While handling the
pearls and diamonds Nara, in her delight at the
gems, forgot her feeling of antagonism towards
Clare. As for Clare, she was loud in her praise.</p>

<p><q>You will suit me splendidly, Nara,</q> she ex-
claimed. <q>You mustn't leave me when we get
to India; but perhaps you won't want to do so.
Please fasten this bracelet.</q></p>

<p>Nara took as much interest in adorning the
beautiful woman as though she were adorning
herself. She lingered lovingly over the Indian
jewels, and made suggestions as to the best way
of wearing them to show off their qualities. Clare
was charmed. When she surveyed herself in the
long glass she decided she had never looked better.</p>

<p>Her last evening in London was a brilliant
success. The other women of the party were put in
the shade, and she came back to the hotel feeling
that in Nara she had become possessed of a treasure.</p>

<p>The next day was occupied in shopping and
<pb n="203"/>
packing, and in the morning Clare called at the
offices of the P. &amp; O. Company and booked two
passages. That evening she and Nara went down
to Southampton and put up at an hotel for a day
and then went on board the steamer.</p>

<p>A week passed over, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton and
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod met to compare notes. The first
subject was that of Nara and Clare Meldrum.
The General's wife warmly thanked the wife of
the Major for her timely help, and expressed a
hope that she had seen the last of her poor brother's
superfluous daughter.</p>

<p><q>I don't suppose she'll ever return to England.
She was quite out of place here. Clare is certain
to keep her in her service, the girl speaking, as
you told me she did, both Hindustani and English.
I only wish I'd had an ayah of that sort when I
was in Simla. I was robbed wholesale through not
knowing the language thoroughly. By the way,
I had a letter from Mary Chowden yesterday,
written just before the steamer started from
Southampton. She's going back to India. You
remember Colonel Chowden, of course?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, he fought under my husband at Mooltan.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, Mary's his daughter. We're very old
friends. She told me in her letter that she'd met
Clare Meldrum on board and introduced herself.
Clare told her she was going on to Calcutta.
What's she doing that for? I don't understand it.</q></p>

<p><q>Perhaps Miss Chowden made a mistake,</q> sug-
gested <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton.</p>

<p><q>Not she. I never knew a sharper girl. Of
course it's no affair of mine. All I can say is that
the thing's very puzzling. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum being so
<pb n="204"/>
ill as Clare made out, one would think she would
go to Delhi the nearest way. I know that in
Simla Clare was an outrageous flirt, and it was
whispered that Guy Horsford, who never took
much notice of girls, was quite smitten. But that's
five years ago and—since then Clare's married.</q></p>

<p>The two ladies exchanged significant glances.
Nowadays one would have said a process of tele-
pathy was going on.</p>

<p><q>Didn't your husband say that Colonel Hors-
ford had obtained a post at Calcutta?</q> asked
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton after a pause.</p>

<p><q>Certainly, and it's that which strikes me as
so curious.</q></p>

<p>Again an exchange of glances.</p>

<p><q>Surely there can't be any connection between
the two things—I mean that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum and
Colonel Horsford should both be going to Calcutta.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I don't think that for a moment,</q> re-
turned <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod, with such promptitude that
those who knew her best, had they heard her,
would have said at once that this was what she
<emph>had</emph> been thinking, and not only for a moment but
ever since she had read Mary Chowden's letter.</p>

<p><q>Still—one never knows,</q> she continued. <q>It
was always a mystery why Clare and her husband
did not get on well together. The reason never
oozed out, and the secrecy both observed was in
itself suspicious. I shall write to Mary and ask
her whether she's heard anything. As I said be-
fore, it's no affair of mine, but one likes to know.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton quite coincided in these views,
and then the ladies fell to discussing other matters
of more immediate interest.</p>

<head type="main">Mistress and Maid</head>

<p>The steamer <name type="vessel" rend="i">Indus</name> was slowly making its way up
the Hooghly. It was sunset and the passengers
crowded to the side of the vessel to admire the
gorgeous colouring of the western sky. To the
north-east Fort William, opposite which the vessel
would shortly be moored, loomed sombre and
grey, save where the walls caught the glory of the
sinking sun. Those whose eyes for the first time
lighted upon a Calcutta sunset—one of the few
picturesque pictures the city presents—were loudly
expressing their admiration. But two of the
gazers were silent—Clare and Nara.</p>

<p>Nara, leaning her elbows on the taffrail and
cradling her chin in her hands, her eyes dilated,
her lips slightly parted, drank in with delight the
varied tints, from a golden brown to the palest
of green, changing continually but so gradually
that one was hardly conscious of any movement.
The instincts of her mother's blood were moving
within her, but she did not know it. She was
quite content to watch the picture without
troubling about the source of the deep sense of
pleasure, of content, of rest, of longing at last
satisfied.</p>

<pb n="206"/>
<p>With Clare it was otherwise. There was no
rest for her active brain, for her fevered heart.
She had been the life and soul of the saloon during
the voyage, and her gaiety was the theme of
admiration, especially among the subalterns who
were going out to join their regiments, not a few
of them, poor fellows, to their speedy death.
But at night a hundred gloomy thoughts oppressed
her, and more than once she reproached herself
bitterly for her folly in yielding to what she some-
times called a caprice, but which she knew was
nothing of the kind. It had been a settled con-
viction with her for some time past that she would
never be happy until she had come face to face
with Guy Horsford once more. If fate were only
kind enough to gratify her, she might even return
to her husband, and, outwardly at least, allow
herself to be reconciled.</p>

<p><q>A word—a look will do that,</q> she told herself
scornfully.</p>

<p>Caprice or not, here she was at Calcutta, and if
Horsford were there she determined not to leave
the city until she had seen him.</p>

<p>The passengers disembarked. Some of the
ladies were stopping for a few weeks in Calcutta,
where they had friends and connections; and to
avoid remark in the future as to her reason for
remaining in Calcutta Clare adopted the suggestion
of a lady who, after her stay in Calcutta, was
going on to Cawnpore that they should put up at
the same boarding-house for the sake of com-
panionship. This settled, then came the question
of Nara. Clare had never overcome her feeling
of antipathy towards the girl, but she had not a
<pb n="207"/>
word to say against her. However, she had taken
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ormerod's hint about engaging her for the
voyage only, and one day, after she had been in
Calcutta a week, she brought up the subject.</p>

<p><q>You know as much about English ways as I
do, Nara, so I suppose you're aware that I can, if
I like, discharge you without notice.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes.</q></p>

<p><q>You remember then what was said when I
engaged you?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, yes.</q></p>

<p>A look of annoyance crept into Clare's face. It
seemed to her that since she had landed the girl
was not so respectful as she had been on board
the steamer.</p>

<p><q>What do you wish yourself? Do you care to
stay on?</q></p>

<p><q>I want to get to Delhi.</q></p>

<p><q>So you told me. I may be going there
shortly, but I don't know when. I suppose you're
in no hurry?</q></p>

<p><q>I will stay with you for a little. I should
like to be engaged by the week.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, very well,</q> said the lady haughtily, <q>let
it be so. It's fair for one as for the other. That
will do.</q></p>

<p>Nara waited in case her mistress had need of her,
but Clare threw herself back on the couch, and
took up a book as a sign that she had said all that
was necessary, and Nara glided away. The look
of annoyance on Clare's face deepened.</p>

<p><q>The girl's like all the rest. East or West
they're just the same,</q> she burst out angrily.
<q>Directly they think you can't do without them
<pb n="208"/>
they begin to give themselves airs. I was in two
minds to pack her off there and then. <emph>She</emph> would
like to be engaged by the week! Indeed! What
next, I wonder? I suppose I'm experiencing
something of the disrespect that those people from
Allahabad were talking about at dinner last night.
They were saying that the native servants were
becoming almost offensive in their behaviour to-
wards their masters and mistresses. I certainly
shan't endure any insulting conduct from Nara.
Just to punish her I won't take her to Delhi with
me—that is,</q> she added hastily, <q>if I <emph>do</emph> go. It
was all very well on board the steamer to have a
maid who looks half English—and even then the
thing wasn't without embarrassment—but in India
—well, I don't want to be mixed up in any scandal.
It's a great mistake when girls in a low class of
life have pretty faces. It would be much better
for themselves and for other people if they were
born plain and grew up ugly.</q></p>

<p>It was certainly true that the captain of the
<name type="vessel" rend="i">Indus</name> had asked <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum to keep an eye on
her handsome maid. He had not a word, he told
Clare, to say against the girl, who was as quiet and
as well-behaved as a lady, but she could not pre-
vent men looking at her and falling in love with
her. Already there had been a serious fight be-
tween two of the petty officers on her account, and
he was not going to have the discipline of the ship
upset by a pair of enticing eyes. Clare had not
forgotten the episode, nor was she blind to the
fact that the male portion of the saloon passengers
had no eyes for herself when Nara was with her.</p>

<p>The nearer the steamer approached the land of
<pb n="209"/>
the sun the more pronounced became the evidence
of the girl's Asiatic descent. This evidence was
difficult to define. It might have been something
in the free and graceful carriage of the figure, it
might have been the steadfast, wistful look in the
shining, dark eyes—such a look as one sees in the
eyes of a faithful dog—nobody could say exactly
what it was, but all were conscious of it, especially
the men, who in the unfettered smoking-room
often discussed Clare and her attractive ayah.</p>

<p>The gradual change irritated Clare. In some
subtle, irrational way she chose to regard the
admiration Nara excited as a personal slight to
herself, and she was often intensely snappish in
consequence, to the surprise of the girl, who could
not understand what offence she had committed.
The truth was, though neither was aware of it,
the antagonism of race was asserting itself.
<q>Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he
be unto his brethren,</q> cried Noah in the bitterness
of his wrath, and the memory has never died out,
nor will it ever do so as long as black is black and
white is white. The spirit of the ancient prophecy
was lurking in Clare's mind, unsuspected, when
she rose from the couch and rang her bell sharply.
Nara presented herself.</p>

<p><q>I've been thinking, Nara, that as you're now
in your native land it would be better if you went
back to your native dress. What you are wearing
now is neither one thing nor the other. I've toler-
ated it hitherto because under the circumstances
allowances had to be made for you, but if you left
me you would hardly be able to obtain another
situation unless you looked like an ordinary ayah.
<pb n="210"/>
The sooner you make the change and get back
to your proper station in life the more advantageous
it will be for you. No doubt <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brampton was
very indulgent, but you mustn't expect in India
to be as you were in England.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't expect it—but—but—I should like to
look like an English girl a little longer.</q></p>

<p><q>Why?</q></p>

<p>Nara drooped her eyes and nervously twisted
her fingers.</p>

<p><q>I cannot tell you why.</q></p>

<p><q>It's all nonsense,</q> returned Clare brusquely;
<q>you must have some reason. What is it?</q></p>

<p>The girl made no answer, but went on twisting
her fingers.</p>

<p><q>We needn't argue the point. You will please
do as I say, and as soon as possible. Don't let
us have any misunderstanding. You had better
go and see about it at once.</q></p>

<p>Nara went slowly from the room, and Clare,
throwing herself back on the couch with her arms
thrown above her shoulders and her head resting
in the hollows of her clasped hands, relapsed into
her favourite pastime of building castles in the
air. Gradually her irritation passed away. She
had been invited to a reception at Government
House the following week, and she was not only
anxious to go but equally anxious to look her
best, and no one could dress and adorn her like
Nara. While she remained in Calcutta Nara's
services were indispensable. One especial reason
of her desire to be present was that at Government
House, the centre of English rule, she would hear
the latest news, military and civil. The talk was
<pb n="211"/>
certain to be mainly of a personal nature, and she
might learn something of Guy Horsford's move-
ments. Up to the present she had not been able
to find out whether he had returned from Burma.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nara was walking slowly down the
main street towards the native quarter. It was of
no use defying her mistress unless she wished to
break with her entirely, and she was not prepared
to do this yet. Ever since she had been in Calcutta
she had taken every opportunity of going out and
wandering in the direction of Government House
in the hopes of seeing <q>Sahib Horsford,</q> and
had even had the courage to ask one of the sentries
if he could tell her anything. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Atkins would
have replied to her surlily had she been old or
ugly, but being what she was he suggested she
should meet him when he was off duty, a proposal
which she answered by walking away at once.
Like Clare, she could get no information, and like
her also she meant to stay in Calcutta until she
was successful.</p>

<p>Nara's object just now was not so much to
pursue her search as to purchase a native dress,
and this could not be done so well in the fashionable
shops patronised by European ladies as in the
bazaars of the native quarter. Her motive for
retaining her English attire was both definite and
romantic. She understood perfectly well—<abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Mowatt had indeed taken considerable trouble to
impress it on her mind—that Sahib Horsford was
anxious that she should become English, both in
her ways and appearance, and that his hope was
she would always remain in England. She knew
she had disobeyed his wishes in returning to India,
<pb n="212"/>
and she thought it would conciliate him if, should
they chance to meet, he saw her in her English
frock.</p>

<p>She reached a squalid, narrow turning, full of
natives, jabbering, laughing, quarrelling. The
roadway was filthy, the smell none too pleasant.
The bazaars of Calcutta are less interesting than
those of any other city in India. They are not
picturesque, and the admixture of very question-
able people from other parts of the world does
not add to their attractiveness.</p>

<p>An English girl would have been frightened to
mingle with the jostling crowd, but Nara entered
the bazaar without hesitation. The noise was
disturbing, the sight of some of the men was re-
pulsive, but she was not deterred. The customs,
the prejudices, the likes and dislikes of the East were
rapidly coming back to her, and she knew that
the majority of the crowd looked upon her as
immodest for appearing in the street with her face
unveiled. But nobody was surprised. They could
see she was an Eurasian, and a daughter of the
East and West might well be degenerate. Be-
sides they were used to Indo-Europeans; there
were any number in Calcutta.</p>

<p>Nara lingered at a shop which was little better
than a stall. Some stuff had taken her fancy, and
she prepared for hard bargaining. The shop-
keeper, after the manner of his kind, asked six
times as much as he would take in the end. The
customer knew this quite well, and the merchant
knew that she did, but the pleasure of chaffering
was too keen to be easily relinquished.</p>

<p>While the girl was beating down the shopkeeper
to her price voices could be heard on the other
side of the gaily coloured woollen hangings which
divided the shop from the rest of the premises.
For some little time Nara did not heed the sounds,
but suddenly a few words struck a chord in her
memory and carried her back to the days of her
nomadic wanderings as a dancing-girl. And not
only were the words familiar, but also the voice
of one of the speakers. Over five years had gone
by since she had heard those shrill, harsh tones,
but they were not to be mistaken. The voice, she
was sure, was that of Sundra Bai, the proprietress
of the dancing troupe, generally known as the
<soCalled>Begum,</soCalled> though she had not the slightest claim
to the title.</p>

<p>For a moment Nara was paralysed with fear.
She was tempted to pay the shopkeeper his price
and escape with her purchase but for one word
uttered by the shrill voice. It was softened after
the Indian fashion, but unmistakable.</p>

<p><q>Sahib Horsford.</q></p>

<p>This was enough for the girl. She resumed her
bargaining, talking very much at random, her ears
fixed on what was going on behind the hangings.</p>

<p><q>You must do what I tell you,</q> snarled the
shrill voice. <q>It is Zeenut Mehal's orders. I
dare not disobey them. She will pay you well.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes—yes, but I—I fear. There are others I
must think of. If they approve—well——</q></p>

<p><q>Others? What others? Who is it who
raises his will against Zeenut Mehal's?</q></p>

<p><q>I must not say. You who are in one of
Zeenut Mehal's secrets ought to know this one.
If I do what you ask me it will put the Sahib-
<pb n="214"/>
logues on their guard. We are not ready yet.
We must wait the signal, and that will not happen
until the fatal day of Plassy draws near.</q></p>

<p><q>You are talking in riddles, Muza Khan. I
know nothing of your fatal days. I only know
the will of Zeenut Mehal and my own righteous
vengeance. Bhowanee will not allow the death
of Hoosein Khan to go unpunished.</q></p>

<p><q>Bhowanee,</q> repeated the other in a hushed
voice, <q>the goddess of murderers—of the thug.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. Hoosein Khan was Mahommedan, but
he had been a thug when he was young, and
Bhowanee protects the thug whatever his faith
may be. You know how I was taking Nara, the
cleverest, the most enticing, the fairest of all my
<foreign xml:lang="hi">tuwaifs</foreign>, to Zeenut Mehal. The Begum had set
her heart upon getting her. Her boy Jewan
Bukht, the apple of her eye, had once seen Nara
dance and asked his mother for her. It was
enough. The girl must be had at any price. She
would have loaded me with gold had I brought
Nara to her safely, but I was robbed of the child
—yes, robbed, Muza—and Hoosein Khan was
murdered. I swore by Siva I would never rest,
while life was in my body, until I had my revenge
on the accursed Feringhee, the thief of Nara—the
assassin of Hoosein Khan.</q></p>

<p><q>Is this true?</q> faltered Muza.</p>

<p><q>I swear it. Zeenut Mehal set her spies to
work, and I warrant you it was not long before
they found out that Azeena's father, Kulloo Bux,
the grain dealer of Delhi, had a hand in the plot.
Kulloo Bux was seized, taken to the Palace and
tortured. In the agonies of death he confessed.
<pb n="215"/>
Azeena and Sahib Horsford strangled Hoosein
Khan. Sahib Horsford stole the girl and sent her
across the Black Water, the Sahib himself fled to
Burma to escape Zeenut Mehal's wrath. He has
returned; he is now in Calcutta. Doubtless he
thinks Zeenut Mehal no longer cares—that I have
forgotten. A daughter of Siva never forgets.
You must kill him, Muza. What now of the
others you talk about? Why should they come
between me and my vengeance?</q></p>

<p><q>I will tell you, but you must be dumb—
breathe not a word. It might mean your death
and mine too. Great things, noble things are
promised before the next monsoon. Our people
have been patient and their patience will be soon
rewarded. A hundred years ago next June the
fate of our country was sealed by the battle of
Plassy. It was a shameful fight. Thousands of
our fighting men covered themselves and our land
with dishonour—they yielded to a mere handful
of the Feringhees. We have seen chains heaped
upon us year after year since the Feringhees
hungered for our country; and that is not enough
—they now hunger for our religion. Why has the
Sahib Dalhousie gone? The Sahib was a great
warrior and he took our lands, but he respected
our faiths, and that was why he was not permitted
to remain. The Sahib Canning has been sent to
destroy our religion—the religion of our fore-
fathers. We are to be made Christians—you will
be forced to eat the flesh of oxen, of pigs. Yes,
unless we fight now for our faith we are doomed.
Do you understand?</q></p>

<p>The man's voice suggested suppressed passion
<pb n="216"/>
in its quivering tones. A long silence followed.
Nara, in the shop, pretended to be interested in
other goods nearer the curtain, and moved thither
to hear better. She was not concerned with the
man's talk about what was to happen during the
year. She knew nothing about Plassy, about Lord
Dalhousie, about Lord Canning. Very little his-
tory was taught at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Granger's seminary for
young ladies. To be able to repeat in parrot
fashion the dates of the reigns of the English kings
and queens was considered quite enough for any
young-lady to know. But, in spite of her ignorance,
Nara felt that what she overheard meant trouble.
But this was overshadowed by her anxiety con-
cerning Horsford. Sundra Bai's appearance in
Calcutta was fully accounted for, and Nara shud-
dered. She knew the cruel, the venomous nature
of the <soCalled>Begum</soCalled>—no one better. There was
danger to herself if she were recognised, but she
cared nothing for this so that she could find Hors-
ford and warn him.</p>

<p>The talk began again, but it was carried on in
low tones, and all that Nara could make out was
that the execution of Sundra Bai's vengeance was
to be deferred until the plans of the <soCalled>others</soCalled>
were ready to be carried out. Directly Nara was
satisfied that the compact was settled she closed
the bargain with the shopkeeper and fled. She
was only just in time, for the next minute the
hangings parted and the old <soCalled>Begum,</soCalled> fat as a
porpoise, and more evil-looking than ever, waddled
into the shop.</p>

<head type="main">In the Balcony</head>

<p>The dinner hour at the boarding-house was seven
o'clock. At half-past eight Clare went to her
room to dress for a concert at which she had
promised to sing. She summoned Nara, but with
no result. Then one of the servants of the house
told her that nothing had been seen of the ayah
for some time. She had gone out about five
o'clock, but had not returned. Clare was inclined
to fly into a passion, but there was no one at hand
upon whom she could vent her temper, and she
thought better of it. She dressed herself with
the assistance of an ayah of another lady boarder.</p>

<p>The concert was got up by a colonel's wife, an
excellent pianist, in aid of some charity, and it
was supported almost entirely by the officers and
their wives and relatives. A barrier slight but
distinct enough existed between the military and
civil sections, although they were continually asso-
ciated. Eurasians, in spite of there being many
in Calcutta who were very wealthy, were con-
sidered quite impossible. This ostracism even
extended to any Englishwoman who elected to
marry an Indo-Briton. The doors of all the
higher circles were closed against her, however
<pb n="218"/>
rich, or whatever might be the attainments of the
man of her choice.</p>

<p>The preponderance of the military element at
the concert gave Clare hopes of hearing news of
Horsford. At all events, she intended to make
inquiries. These inquiries sent her home from
the concert in a flutter of joyful expectation.
She had heard that Horsford was in Calcutta, and
that he was certain to be at the Governor-General's
reception the following week. The thought that
she was about to see him engrossed her completely,
and drove every other idea out of her head. She
had quite forgotten Nara and her strange absence,
and she rang the bell mechanically. The girl came
into the room so pale and so agitated that Clare,
in spite of her absorption, did not fail to notice
her altered appearance.</p>

<p><q>What have you been doing? You were not
here when I came up to dress after dinner. You
knew I was going out, and yet you must choose
to suit your own convenience, and leave me to
shift for myself. I can't put up with that kind
of thing. Where did you go?</q></p>

<p><q>To buy the <foreign xml:lang="hi">sari</foreign> and other things you said I
was to wear,</q> Nara answered. She seemed to be
very weak, and grasped the back of a chair to
steady herself.</p>

<p><q>That was at five o'clock. It's now nearly
midnight. What time did you come in?</q></p>

<p><q>About an hour ago.</q></p>

<p>Clare frowned. She expected Nara to name a
much earlier hour, and hoped for the satisfaction
of finding her out in a falsehood. The girl's frank
admission rather took the wind out of Clare's
<pb n="219"/>
sails, but she had another tack to go upon—the
reason of Nara's stopping out so late. She put
the question.</p>

<p><q>I heard bad news in the bazaar—about—
about a friend. He is in great danger, and I
wanted to warn him. I have been walking about
trying to find him, but could not; then rude men,
seeing me alone, spoke to me. I was frightened,
and I ran home.</q></p>

<p><q>It serves you right for being so silly as to stop
out so late. Calcutta swarms with bad char-
acters. You ought to know that better than I
do. Take my hair down and brush it.</q></p>

<p>Nara pulled herself together, but the brushing
of Clare's luxuriant hair was done languidly and
in a perfunctory fashion. She was relieved that
Clare did not further question her. Her story
was perfectly true. She had walked up and down
in front of Government House until, as might be
expected, she was spoken to. She reached the
boarding-house exhausted and trembling.</p>

<p>The days went on. The nerves both of Clare
and Nara were so highly strung that it was wonder-
ful they did not quarrel. Never was their antago-
nism so pronounced. Clare at times was at such
a pitch of tension that she was strongly tempted
to pay the girl a month's wages and tell her to go.
Nara's very presence irritated her. But her skill
in dressing hair—that had to be thought of. She
must be retained until the reception at Govern-
ment House. After that was over the sooner she
went the better.</p>

<p>As for Nara, the listlessness and languor, indi-
cative of the Eastern strain in her nature, so
<pb n="220"/>
manifest after her arrival in Calcutta, had dis-
appeared. The realisation of many a dream was
at hand. She had now something to live for.</p>

<p><q>The Sahib is in danger. I must warn him,</q>
she repeated to herself over and over again, as
though to keep her mission in mind. As if she
could ever forget it! But it was very difficult to
fulfil. Not only did Clare refuse her permission
to go out save for a very short time, taunting her
with wanting to meet the admirer who had kept
her out so late on the night of the concert, but
when she stole out while Clare was visiting she
had to be constantly on the watch lest she should
meet the <soCalled>Begum.</soCalled></p>

<p>On the day of the reception at Government House
Clare was a little more amiable, possibly because
she wanted Nara to be in a good humour on account
of the all-important business of the toilette.</p>

<p><q>Do you remember, Nara, the first time you
did my hair?</q> she asked, in dulcet tones.</p>

<p><q>Yes, I do.</q></p>

<p><q>I want it arranged in the same way for to-
night—with the rope of pearls, you know, and
the diamonds at the sides.</q></p>

<p><q>I understand.</q></p>

<p>Clare took her seat in front of the toilette glass,
and Nara began. She did not take particular
pains, and perhaps for that very reason was all
the more successful. There was an air of <emph>abandon</emph>,
an absence of effort which added to the effect.
Clare was highly pleased, and certainly she never
looked more handsome and attractive.</p>

<p><q>I'll see how she goes on. Perhaps I won't get
rid of her just yet,</q> was her thought.</p>

<pb n="221"/>
<p>After the reception, which was confined to the
officers in or passing through Calcutta, there was
to be a <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">soirée</foreign> with music, and perhaps dancing.
It all depended upon Lady Canning. She had the
reputation of being exceedingly amiable, and
every one was sure there would be no rigid formality.</p>

<p>The proceedings were well advanced when Clare
entered the crowded room. A military band was
playing some lively Offenbach airs; some of the
guests were promenading, groups were talking,
the inevitable <soCalled>wall-flowers</soCalled> were not absent.
Clare had come with a lady who was a personal
friend of Lady Canning's, and the introduction to
her hostess over, she was at liberty to look about
her.</p>

<p>When Clare entered the room she saw with
much satisfaction people turning their heads to
look at her. The whisperings which followed did
not go unnoticed. Clare knew she was being
criticised, and she was quite indifferent whether
the criticisms were favourable or the reverse. The
women were probably severely condemnatory,
but this condemnation was a compliment. It
was the opinion of the men that mattered. One
rapid glance round told her that she had their
admiration.</p>

<p>A knot of officers were in deep conversation in
one corner. The centre of the group was a man
to whom the others paid great deference. The
officer on his right had his back turned towards
Clare, and something said to him caused him to
turn towards the speaker and reply. Clare saw
his profile, and her heart beat violently. It was
like Guy Horsford's and yet unlike. The face was
<pb n="222"/>
certainly thinner, the features more clearly cut
than Guy's were five years before. Suddenly he
threw his head back slightly with a quick move-
ment Clare remembered well when he wished to
be emphatic. The little trick of manner revealed
his personality at once.</p>

<p>The tell-tale blood rushed to her cheeks. The
lady who had accompanied her was speaking, but
Clare did not hear a word. The consciousness
that the man who for over five years had never
been for long absent from her thoughts was in
sight of her eyes was overwhelming. She had
mentally rehearsed the scene of their first meeting
many times. She intended to be very calm and
cool; she was certain she would be quite mistress
of her emotions. Now that the moment had
arrived she felt as helpless as a child.</p>

<p>One of her grievances against Horsford, and the
one that angered her most, was the blow his
desertion—as she called it—had inflicted on her
vanity. This grievance was sometimes palliated
by the thought that possibly it was a sense of her
fascinations which had kept him away. She had
tried to comfort herself by fancying that he was
afraid of being tempted. For she <emph>had</emph> tempted
him once, impelled by some power she could not
resist—a power that had found her at her weakest.
The punishment she meant to inflict was that he
should be again fascinated, only to be disappointed.
She had longed to see him make love to her—she
had longed to laugh in his face. This was only
one of her many moods. She had others which
were tender and forgiving.</p>

<p>But now everything was forgotten in the one
<pb n="223"/>
supreme fact that he was within sight, almost
within hearing. All thought of the mask of in-
difference she intended to put on, of the piece of
clever acting she meant to essay was gone. An
inexplicable fear seized her. Something seemed
to say that it were safer and better not to meet
him. It was so easy to invent an excuse—a
sudden headache would be enough. Yet the very
idea of showing the white feather concerning the
man over whom she had once triumphed and
whom she had dreamed of bringing to his knees
was sufficient to awake her rebellious spirit. She
roused herself, and her elastic nervous system
answered to the call.</p>

<p><q>Who is the officer in the centre of the group
over yonder?</q> said she.</p>

<p>It was marvellous how she had conquered her
emotions. She spoke to her friend in the tone of
one who had no interest in putting the question
beyond idle curiosity.</p>

<p><q>That is the commander-in-chief, General
Anson,</q> said the lady. <q>He and my husband
are old comrades.</q></p>

<p><q>You know him very well then?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh yes. He is a very charming man. I hope
his responsibilities just now won't prove too
heavy for him. Great changes are taking place
everywhere in India, and some people talk very
gloomily about the future. I don't know why,
for all seems very much the same to me.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course. You needn't go far at any time
for dismal prophets. They date from Jeremiah.
I like General Anson's face exceedingly.</q></p>

<p><q>When I see an opportunity I'll try to introduce
<pb n="224"/>
you. Just now he appears to be much absorbed.
No doubt he is interested in what has been going
on in Burma. The man to the right, Colonel
Horsford, went through the whole of the campaign
and has just come from Pegu.</q></p>

<p><q>Colonel Horsford? I knew a little of a Cap-
tain Horsford in Simla years ago. Would that be
the same?</q></p>

<p><q>Most likely. You may have a chance of
satisfying yourself. It's always pleasant to re-
new old acquaintances.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes—of course. Thank you very much, dear
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Chandos.</q></p>

<p>Clare could hardly trust herself to speak.
Outwardly quite composed, for the rosy colour had
fled under the tenseness of her nerves, inwardly
she was a prey to conflicting emotions. Once
more the monitor of her conscience spoke to her,
but she steeled herself against its warnings.</p>

<p><q>Ah, now is our chance,</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Chandos.
<q>Lady Canning has broken up the conference.
We'll saunter by and then we can stop as if acci-
dentally. I shall be glad to exchange a few words
with the General. I haven't had the opportunity
of talking to him yet.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Chandos was as good as her word. She
carried out her little plan successfully; General
Anson received Clare with the amiable deference
a man, no matter what his rank may be, always
shows towards a pretty woman, and they chatted
about Simla, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Chandos having mentioned that
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum, or rather her husband, had a
bungalow there.</p>

<p><q>I'm going to start for the hills shortly,</q> said
<pb n="225"/>
the General pleasantly. <q>Perhaps I shall have
the pleasure of meeting you.</q></p>

<p>Clare smiled, and said she hoped so. Then
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Chandos intervened, and Clare turned her
eyes carelessly and let them fall on Horsford's
bronzed face. She purposely showed no sign of
recognition. She wanted him to speak first. Her
dissimulation was perfect. While she was staring
blankly at him, she was quite conscious he knew
her and was struggling to appear at ease. It gave
her a sense of triumph to know that she apparently
was unmoved and that he was in some confusion.</p>

<p>But she was mistaken as to the cause. He did
not know she was married, and to hear her intro-
duced as <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum to General Anson came upon
him with the effect of a cold douche. Though in
the old days at Simla he had a sense of rivalry
in regard to Andrew Meldrum, he never imagined
Clare had thought seriously about the merchant.</p>

<p><q>Clare!</q> she heard him say.</p>

<p>The sound of his deep, sonorous voice was almost
too much for her self-possession. It brought back
so much that was tender and human. All her
intended artifices vanished. She put out her
hand without a word, her eyes humid, a faint rose-
tint suffusing her face even to her neck. It was
rare that Clare showed such emotion.</p>

<p><q>I'm glad to see you looking so well,</q> he went
on after a pause.</p>

<p><q>Thank you—Colonel Horsford. You see, I've
heard of your advancement. I'm sure it's well
deserved. May I congratulate you? Meanwhile,</q>
she added, with a touch of her old raillery, <q>it
isn't necessary to hold my hand for ever.</q></p>

<pb n="226"/>
<p>She could not resist the thrust. It was accom-
panied by a swift glance, at once reproachful and
indulgent.</p>

<p><q>I beg your pardon—<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum.</q></p>

<p>Horsford did not mean this as a counter-thrust.
Clare, however, so interpreted it. The <q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Meldrum</q> sent a disagreeable little shiver over
her body.</p>

<p>Suddenly he discovered they were by them-
selves. The group of talkers had broken up, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Chandos had gone off with General Anson, and
there was no one near to whom they were known.
But in a crowded room anything like an exchange
of confidences was impossible.</p>

<p><q>Shall we move from here?</q> said Horsford
presently. <q>I fancy we're rather in the way.
Let us go into the balcony. The noise of the band
is rather distracting, don't you think so?</q></p>

<p>She bowed and took his proffered arm without
a word. They threaded their way between the
groups towards the long, door-like windows open-
ing into the balcony, which looked cool and
refreshing enough, transformed as it had been into
a bower of foliage and flowers.</p>

<p>While traversing the room Clare had had time
to collect herself. It was too bad of Guy, she
thought, to irritate her before they had been
together five minutes. They sat down on a seat
just large enough for both, and half shielded from
the gaze of any one in the room who might pass
the open window.</p>

<p><q>You don't look a day older, Clare,</q> said he,
breaking a silence which promised to become
embarrassing.</p>

<pb n="227"/>
<p><q>Nor you. Perhaps a little thinner.</q></p>

<p><q>Very likely. I've been doing a deal of hard
work the last five years, but hard work suits me.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, you're not any the worse for being thinner.
The alert, wiry man is always the best.</q></p>

<p>If Clare had intended to express her liking for
Guy Horsford she could not have gone nearer the
mark, for he answered to the description. His
active life away from enervating Delhi had vastly
improved him. He had not an ounce of super-
fluous flesh. He suggested a finely trained horse,
ready for endurance as well as speed.</p>

<p>Another pause, again to be broken by Horsford.</p>

<p><q>You congratulated me just now—may I be
allowed to congratulate you?</q></p>

<p><q>On what?</q></p>

<p><q>On your marriage, of course. Or perhaps I
ought rather to congratulate <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum.</q></p>

<p><q>You needn't. He's not here to reply for
himself, and I'm not in a position to do it for him.</q></p>

<p>She spoke tartly, and Horsford gave a side glance
at her. There was no necessity for her to tell
him in so many words that her marriage was a
failure. He could see it in her face, he could
hear it in her voice. He would have dropped the
subject, but it was hardly possible. Neither
Clare's marriage nor her husband could be ignored.</p>

<p><q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum, then, is not in Calcutta?</q> he
went on.</p>

<p><q>No. Why do you ask?</q></p>

<p><q>I thought I saw him yesterday in the Maidan.</q></p>

<p><q>It's quite impossible!</q> exclaimed Clare hastily.
<q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum's in Delhi. He's not very well.</q></p>

<p>Horsford was puzzled. An uncomfortable sus-
<pb n="228"/>
picion crept into his mind—a suspicion which
pained him and which he could not easily dismiss.
Scandals were so common in Delhi. Meldrum ill
in Delhi, his wife in Calcutta—what did it mean?</p>

<p>Clare must have read Horsford's thoughts.
She went on to say:</p>

<p><q>I've just come from England. I had a nervous
breakdown over a year ago, and I had to leave
Delhi. The climate was killing me.</q></p>

<p><q>The change has done you good?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I don't know,</q> she answered hastily.
<q>Perhaps. Of course I've been free from worry—
still, at times I've felt very lonely.</q></p>

<p><q>You've been travelling by yourself, then?</q></p>

<p><q>Good Heavens, Guy, do you think I could
endure travelling a whole year and more with my
husband? It would drive me mad!</q></p>

<p>She could no longer command herself. The
presence of Guy Horsford had been too much for
her overwrought nerves. All idea of triumphing
over him, of fascinating him, even, had vanished.
What she wanted now was sympathy, tenderness.
What she had had from him was cold questioning
about her husband and her marriage!</p>

<p>A dozen impulses crowded upon her. She could
have flown into a passion or burst into tears with
equal facility. Perhaps the most galling of her
thoughts was the precipitancy with which she had
accepted Andrew Meldrum. If she had only
waited! Fate had with cruel kindness thrown
her into Horsford's path. She believed he still
loved her. She thought she read love in his eyes,
in the vibration of his voice when the old word of
familiarity, <q>Clare,</q> came from his lips. And to
<pb n="229"/>
think that by her own act she was fettered! How
small their differences seemed now. How childish
her jealousy of a miserable dancing-girl—a girl too
who belonged to the class most despised in India,
the Eurasians! She had never troubled about
the girl since. She did not know what had become
of her and did not care. Oh, it was intolerable!</p>

<p><q>Guy—why did you leave me without a word?
You were cruel—cruel!</q></p>

<p>The words burst from her without premeditation,
and left her panting—hysterical. Horsford was
dumbfounded, but whatever his feelings were
towards her the moment was not one for weakness.</p>

<p><q>Is it worth while to revive what's dead? You
must think of me what you will. We've each
chosen our own path. Let us continue in it.
It's better and wiser—you must know that as
well as I do.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, for you, no doubt. But what about
me? You're a man and free. I'm a woman and
a slave.</q></p>

<p><q>Clare—Clare, you're talking downright non-
sense.</q></p>

<p>Horsford tried to introduce a note of sternness,
but with not much success. His voice was not
without pity—even tenderness.</p>

<p><q>Oh, I dare say,</q> she retorted. <q>Women,
according to some men, talk nothing else. Per-
haps it's because they're such fools. Women
ought never to be judged by what they say, but
by what they do. I was horribly silly to be
offended with you. I was not myself. You
ought to have known that and made allowances.
You had no business to take me seriously.</q></p>

<pb n="230"/>
<p><q>And if I were to admit that,</q> he returned
very slowly, <q>what good would it do—<emph>now</emph>?</q></p>

<p><q>No good at all, I suppose. I wonder you don't
say that what I did—marrying a man for whom
I didn't care a bit—was my own fault—and that
what followed might have been expected.</q></p>

<p><q>What followed! Surely—surely, Clare, you
haven't left your husband?</q></p>

<p>Horsford spoke with concern, almost with agita-
tion.</p>

<p><q>I understand what you mean,</q> she exclaimed
bitterly, <q>but you're wrong. I've told you already
why I went away, but it wasn't quite the truth
that it was on account of my health. India suits
me admirably, but I couldn't endure my husband,
and I left him. I went to England by myself
and I returned by myself.</q></p>

<p><q>But—but does he allow you to do this with-
out remonstrance?</q> asked Horsford, a little
staggered.</p>

<p><q>Oh, there have been remonstrances enough, I
promise you. Of course he's always urging me to
return. I have a letter from him—it reached me
just before I left England, and I haven't answered
it—which I should like to show you some day.
I——</q></p>

<p><q>Pray do nothing of the kind,</q> interrupted
Horsford hastily. <q>You've given me too many
confidences already.</q></p>

<p><q>And why shouldn't I? Who has a better
right to my confidence than you?</q></p>

<p>Guy Horsford was silent. Her eyes flashed a
look upon him, eloquent with meaning, and then
dropped instantly.</p>

<pb n="231"/>
<p><q>If you'd come to me when I asked you—if
you'd only sent me a line!</q></p>

<p><q>You had my letter. I wrote it immediately
I had yours. I had but an hour before starting
for Calcutta to join Godwin's force.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, to escape from me. That was why you
went to Burma. It was rather cowardly, wasn't
it?</q></p>

<p>The injustice of this accusation stung Horsford
to the quick.</p>

<p><q>You're wrong, Clare. You've no right to say
such a thing. My application to join the Burma
expedition was made before I went to Simla, and
weeks before our meeting at your uncle's bungalow,</q>
he cried angrily. <q>When I went down for a
few weeks' holiday at Simla, how on earth could
I tell I was to meet my fate there in the shape of
yourself? You ought to know that a man in the
army can't be transferred from one regiment to
another in five minutes. It means the unwinding
of any amount of red tape.</q></p>

<p>Something either in Horsford's reproachful words
or in his voice moved her. Tears suddenly started
in her eyes.</p>

<p><q>Forgive me, Guy. Yes, I was unjust to you.
Forget my silliness.</q></p>

<p>She insinuated her arm beneath his coaxingly,
and inclined her head towards his shoulder.</p>

<p>At that moment the window was darkened.
A man was entering the balcony. One more
step, and his eyes were fixed upon them. With a
little gasp of terror Clare sprang to her feet, and
white and trembling faced the intruder—Andrew
Meldrum!</p>

<head type="main">Husband and Wife</head>

<p>Meldrum glared at them both for an instant.</p>

<p><q>So I was not misinformed.&#x2026; I flatly con-
tradicted the man who told me that you &#x2026; my
wife &#x2026; were in Calcutta. What's the explana-
tion? Do you refer me to &#x2026; this gentleman?</q></p>

<p>Andrew Meldrum's words came from his pallid
lips with a hissing of the breath. He stood rigid,
his arms hanging straight, his hands clenched.
Horsford had sprung from his seat almost as soon
as Clare, and met Meldrum's glaring eyes de-
fiantly. Notwithstanding his defiance, he appre-
ciated the embarrassing, the compromising nature
of the situation, but how compromising it was he
did not then realise. Clare had not told him all.</p>

<p><q>You are entitled to an explanation, and so
far as I'm able to give you one you shall have it,
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum,</q> he said quickly.</p>

<p><q>Oh—you know me. So much the better.
Just to clear the air—who are you?</q></p>

<p>The balcony was not lighted save for the feeble
illumination coming through the windows, and
Horsford was in shadow.</p>

<p><q>We're not unacquainted to each other, <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Meldrum. I am Colonel Horsford. In Simla you
knew me as Captain Horsford, and——</q></p>

<pb n="233"/>
<p><q><emph>You!</emph> Ha, I'm beginning to see daylight,</q>
interrupted Meldrum, nodding his head slowly and
mechanically.</p>

<p><q>Stop,</q> cried Clare wildly. <q>You see nothing
at all. You're blind &#x2026; as you've always been.
I alone am answerable for everything. Colonel
Horsford knew nothing of my being in Calcutta.
We met accidentally half an hour ago. I refer
you to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Chandos.</q></p>

<p>Clare's explanation sounded lame. It was true
so far as Horsford was concerned, but not true in
regard to Clare herself. It was the consciousness
of this that made her voice ring falsely. Meldrum
heard her unmoved.</p>

<p><q>You tell me I've seen nothing. Then you
were not caressing &#x2026; your old friend &#x2026; may-
be your old lover, for aught I can tell &#x2026; when I
entered. I'm afraid I spoiled sport. I apologise.
I hardly know what is the proper course for me—
the husband—to take. The practice among <emph>gentle-
men</emph> under similar awkward circumstances used
to be to do their best to kill each other. I don't
propose to do anything so silly. What do you
suggest, Colonel Horsford?</q></p>

<p><q>I suggest nothing, sir. I'm prepared to take
full responsibility for any offence you may attribute
to me. I'm concerned only for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum.
It's but bare justice to her to say that since I left
Simla, over five years ago, I've had no communica-
tion with her, and when I entered this house I
had not the slightest idea I should meet her. We
had a perfect right to talk as old friends, and any
suspicion that we are otherwise is both groundless
and childish.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, your stories agree wonderfully. I might
have expected as much. I suppose there's nothing
left for me but to accept your explanations and
be thankful it's no worse. Perhaps I'd better not
seek to know more. At any rate, I presume I
haven't at present abrogated my rights over <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Meldrum. I'm still her husband. For the mo-
ment we won't go beyond this. You say you are
concerned for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum. Permit me to take
<emph>that</emph> responsibility. You'll have the goodness to
come with me, Clare—at once.</q></p>

<p>His imperious air, his sneering tones, cut Clare
like the slash of a whip.</p>

<p><q>I refuse,</q> she cried, her eyes blazing. <q>I'm
not your slave, Andrew Meldrum, though you paid
a high price for me. Go by yourself. Do what
you like. I don't care.</q></p>

<p><q>You mean that you prefer to remain with your
paramour?</q></p>

<p>The accusation was intolerable. Hitherto Hors-
ford had kept a strong curb upon himself—indeed,
it seemed to him the position was so unhappy that
he could not interfere without making matters
worse, but Meldrum's offensive charge was not
to be borne.</p>

<p><q>That's a falsehood, sir!</q> he cried hotly, <q>and
—what is much worse—a gross insult to your wife.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you defend her?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, against insults, even insults from her
own husband.</q></p>

<p>Meldrum was silent. He seemed to be taken
aback by Horsford's bold front. He stood biting
his lips and evidently puzzled what to do. Before
he could answer Clare interposed.</p>

<pb n="235"/>
<p><q>Thank you, Colonel Horsford, but I can de-
fend myself. I refused just now to accompany
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum. I've altered my mind, I suppose
you'd like to go now. I'm quite ready.</q></p>

<p>Clare's words were addressed to her husband,
but they were meant for Horsford, and the latter
understood. She did not want the two men to
quarrel.</p>

<p>Meldrum showed no signs of triumph at his wife's
submission. He simply shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><q>I'm glad you've come to your senses,</q> said
he, almost contemptuously.</p>

<p>Clare heard him with studied indifference.</p>

<p><q>Would you be good enough to take me to the
ante-room?</q> said she icily to Meldrum. <q>My
wraps are there.</q></p>

<p>Meldrum would have offered his arm, but Clare
anticipated him by passing swiftly into the room.
For an instant Horsford and Meldrum were alone.
The former stepped forward hastily.</p>

<p><q>This matter can't end here. I shall write to
you.</q></p>

<p><q>As you please. A letter to Osmonde's hotel
will find me.</q></p>

<p>Husband and wife threaded their way between
the groups. Horsford stood in the window watch-
ing them and saw Clare leave her husband and
proceed alone to the ante-room.</p>

<p>The whole affair was the most extraordinary and
most unhappy complication possible; as humilia-
ting as it was unhappy, and not the less so because
he was innocent of having done anything purposely
to bring about the catastrophe. Guy Horsford
had come from Burma a free man, without an
<pb n="236"/>
embarrassment of any kind, eager to devote him-
self heart and soul to assist in smoothing out the
difficulties of which those who could see below
the surface of things in India were apprehensive,
and without a moment's notice he was plunged
into an entanglement out of which there appeared
to be no escape with honour.</p>

<p><q>What does it mean? Nemesis?</q> he asked
himself gloomily.</p>

<p>It was impossible to tell where Clare's com-
plexity of character would lead her. Rashness,
uncontrollable impulses, strong feminine egotism,
pertinacity—a formidable combination indeed, and
one full of the unexpected. How much of what
she had said was he to believe? She had told him
distinctly Meldrum was in Delhi. Did she know-
ingly tell him a lie? Was it true she had been
away from her husband over a year, travelling by
herself? If so, was there any cause other than
her <soCalled>nervous breakdown,</soCalled> and her inability to
endure Meldrum's society? If she spoke the
truth, why had she come to Calcutta? Was she
returning to her husband?</p>

<p>It was all puzzling, worrying, and made the
more so by the revelation that Clare had never
forgotten the love passages of that fateful evening
in Simla. Did not her eyes speak even more
than her tender reproaches?</p>

<p><q>If I'd the slightest idea she was going to be so
foolish I'd never have suggested talking in the
balcony. That was my fault, I know. What's the
next step? Write my letter of explanation to
Meldrum, of course, and chance his accepting it.
I can think of nothing else. What to do about
<pb n="237"/>
Clare is a much harder nut to crack. Best do
nothing, I suppose. It will all simmer down.
Matrimonial squabbles generally do. Anyhow, the
superfluous third person always makes matters
worse. Clare surely will have the sense to smooth
Meldrum over. Yes, I shall let things drift so
far as she's concerned.</q></p>

<p>An uncomfortable reflection flashed across Hors-
ford's mind that letting things drift had already
borne disastrous consequences. The letter he
had written to Clare on the eve of his departure
for Burma had not made it clear that he had
severed himself completely and entirely from her.
It had seemed at the time brutal to say as much
in so many words, but as the sequel had shown it
would be wiser to have been cruel to be kind.</p>

<p>Horsford rapidly traversed the crowded room.
He descended the broad staircase, pushed his way
through the crowd of native servants, and reached
the hall. A carriage was waiting at the foot of
the steps, and a lady and gentleman were about
to get inside. Horsford was half way down the
steps before he realised that the two were Andrew
Meldrum and Clare. Having no wish for a further
encounter with either, Horsford would have re-
treated, when he heard his name screamed in shrill,
feminine accents: <q>Sahib Horsford!</q></p>

<p>The space in front of Government House was
thronged by natives eager for sight-seeing, no
matter how trivial. It was difficult to say where
the cry came from; there was a commotion, the
carriage started, and at the same moment a slim,
white-robed figure ran from the crowd in front of
the horses. Then she was seen to fall; either her
<pb n="238"/>
foot had slipped or her scarf had caught the pole
of the carriage. Guttural shrieks and yells were
heard on all sides. The horses were fresh and
spirited, and one reared, preventing the coachman
from seeing what was going on. His whip slashed
the flanks of the restive steeds, and they sprang
forward.</p>

<p>What happened next was Horsford springing
at a bound from the steps to the horses' heads and
forcing them back till they were on their haunches.
Lying motionless on the ground beneath their
plunging hoofs was a girl, her veil torn from her
face. Half a dozen dusky forms crept forward
and drew her out of danger. Horsford let go his
hold of the horses and helped them. There was
blood on her white <foreign xml:lang="hi">sari</foreign>, and she was insensible.</p>

<p><q>A smart bit of work that, Horsford. Another
second, and those thundering hoofs would have
pounded her to a jelly. By Jove, what a hand-
some girl!</q></p>

<p>This was from an officer who had been standing
near the spot at the commencement of the incident.
He had quickly followed Horsford, whom he knew,
and the two Englishmen were bending over the girl.</p>

<p><q>Is she hurt much?</q> whispered Horsford's
friend.</p>

<p><q>I don't know. The head seems to have es-
caped. That blood's from a cut in the arm. Fell
on a stone, perhaps. We'd better get her to the
hospital, anyhow.</q></p>

<p>A sergeant was looking on, and Horsford spoke
to him. The sergeant thought he knew where to
find a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dhoolie</foreign>, and he ran off. One of the native
police came up to Horsford.</p>

<pb n="239"/>
<p><q>The Sahib in the carriage wishes me to tell
you,</q> said the man, <q>that he regrets the accident,
and that if it is his fault in any way will you send
word to him. The Sahib says that you know
where he is to be found.</q></p>

<p>Horsford, then, had been recognised by the
Meldrums. He did not know whether to be
pleased or sorry. He sent a brief message by the
policeman to the effect that he could not tell if
the girl was seriously hurt, but that he would see
she was properly attended to. She would be taken
to the hospital. The man went back to Meldrum,
and presently the carriage rolled by. Horsford
purposely kept his head bent, and did not see
Clare's drawn, pale face at the carriage window.
Presently the sergeant and a couple of men arrived
with the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dhoolie</foreign>, and the girl was carried away,
still unconscious.</p>

<p>The carriage meanwhile was speeding on its
way to Osmonde's Hotel. Not a word passed
between Clare and her husband. When the car-
riage stopped Meldrum alighted and held out his
hand.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> said she curtly. <q>I am not coming.
I'm going on to my boarding-house. You'd
perhaps like to know where it is. I'm staying
at Stephenson's.</q></p>

<p><q>Does this mean you intend to go right away
from me?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know exactly what I intend to do.
Anyhow, I don't mean to stay at your hotel to-
night.</q></p>

<p><q>And what about your explanation you were so
anxious to give me a short time ago?</q></p>

<pb n="240"/>
<p><q>My explanation will keep. I'll give it you
to-morrow. I shall want an explanation from
you.</q></p>

<p><q>From me? About what?</q></p>

<p><q>About the frankly brutal letter you sent me.
That virtually decided me. I looked upon it as
my dismissal. I didn't suit you—you were greatly
disappointed, and you told me to go.</q></p>

<p><q>Clare!</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I have the letter, and I shall never destroy
it lest you may be tempted to deny your own
words. I presume you'll agree with me that we
can hardly discuss a matter of this kind through
a carriage door, and I don't suppose you think of
dragging me out by force. May I beg the loan
of your carriage? If not, I can walk. It's no
distance from here to Stephenson's.</q></p>

<p>Meldrum bowed, and wheeling round abruptly
walked away slowly and entered the hotel. He
was choking, not with rage, but with grief and
mortification. Rigid as his principles were, he
could have found it in his heart to forgive his wife
had she shown the slightest sign of remorse. But
her attitude was one which he could not help
thinking was intended to anger him further and
raise the barriers already existing between them.
He did not want to believe her guilty, but what
was he to think?</p>

<p>Clare, left in the carriage, had not time to
speculate as to what her husband's cold acquies-
cence might mean, for in a couple of minutes she
was at the boarding-house. So far as it was
possible for her to turn the thing over in her mind
she was puzzled. She was not one to understand
<pb n="241"/>
passiveness in a man. She was inclined to attribute
it either to cowardice or craft. Andrew Meldrum,
she knew, was not a coward—therefore silence in
his case meant craft.</p>

<p><q>He's preparing something. I'm sure of it,</q> she
murmured. <q>Well, we shall see.</q></p>

<p>She walked wearily to her room. She was sick
at heart and tired in brain. The entire fabric of
the castle she had built in the air was shattered.
She had pictured a triumph. She had suffered
defeat. The net result of all her scheming was
to deepen the dislike of her husband to hatred.
She had gone through a process of degradation in
his eyes. No argument could do away with this
fact. The effect was to harden her, to blind her
to the consequences of her headstrong folly.</p>

<p>Yet with all her egotism Clare was helpless by
herself. She felt horribly lonely. She sank on
the couch and tried to picture all that had happened
during that too brief half hour on the balcony.
How she had looked forward to meeting Horsford,
to fascinating him afresh! She believed she had
made herself invincible—thanks to Nara and she
would have conquered, but for the unlucky in-
trusion of her husband.</p>

<p>She glanced at the mirror as if to justify her
thoughts. Her hair was certainly arranged in a
fashion that was strangely effective. It was
a mystery how it was put up; it was equally a
mystery how it was to be taken down. Only
Nara could do it properly. She languidly rose
and rang the bell. A servant belonging to the
house appeared in answer to the summons. Nara
had gone out soon after the mem-sahib, and had
<pb n="242"/>
not returned. It was now eleven o'clock. This
meant that the girl had been away some three
hours.</p>

<p><q>Unpardonable,</q> exclaimed Clare angrily.
<q>She may stop out altogether. I'll have no more
to do with her. Can you wait on me to-night?</q></p>

<p>The woman hesitated and mumbled something.
Like all the native servants, she had only one
idea—the special duties for which she had been
engaged.</p>

<p><q>How ridiculous! Of course I shall pay you.
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stephenson will have no objection, I'm sure.
Ah, here is <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stephenson.</q></p>

<p>A heavy step was heard in the corridor, and
the portly proprietress of the boarding-house was
seen approaching.</p>

<p><q>Have you heard about poor Nara?</q> she called
out, before she reached Clare.</p>

<p><q>I've heard nothing. I've been wanting her.</q></p>

<p><q>She's met with an accident. The poor girl
was knocked down and run over in front of Govern-
ment House. Hasun, one of my khidmutgars, saw
it all, and he's just come in with the news. She
seems to have run in front of a carriage and slipped
just as the horses were starting. It was no fault
of the coachman.</q></p>

<p>Clare started. Instantly the scene was before
her eyes. She saw the girl lying on the ground,
and Guy Horsford bending over her. No wonder,
with his gaze fixed on Nara's beauty, Horsford
had no eyes for <emph>her</emph>. A pang of jealousy shot
through her—absurd, unreasonable, of course, but
she could not help it.</p>

<p><q>I'm afraid it was</q>—she was about to say
<pb n="243"/>
<q>my husband's carriage,</q> but this would mean
explaining things to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stephenson, and she was
in no mood for explanations, so she substituted
<q>the carriage that brought me home. I knew
something had happened—that somebody had
met with an accident, but I'd not the least idea
it was Nara.</q></p>

<p><q>Dear me, what an extraordinary coincidence
that you should have been in the very carriage.
The khidmutgar says that the girl saw some one
she knew, called out his name, and ran across the
road to speak to him, and in her hurry stumbled
and fell.</q></p>

<p>Called out his name? Yes, Clare had heard
the girl's voice, and the words certainly sounded
like <q>Sahib Horsford,</q> but she put down the re-
semblance to her fancy, for at the moment Guy
Horsford was uppermost in her mind.</p>

<p><q>How shocking! If I had only known, of course
I should have looked after her myself. Is she
much hurt?</q></p>

<p><q>The khidmutgar could not tell me. She was
carried to the hospital in a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dhoolie</foreign>, and two
English officers were looking after her.</q></p>

<p>Clare's heart beat violently. She was silent for
a few seconds, and then with an effort said:</p>

<p><q>And the man the girl was calling to—did he
go as well?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, according to Hasun's story, one of the
English officers was the man. I can hardly be-
lieve it—you know what inveterate gossips the
natives are, and what splendid liars they can be
when they like.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes.</q></p>

<pb n="244"/>
<p>The word was little more than breathed. Clare
felt as though a pall had suddenly descended upon
her. Everything was vague save one—her jealous
hatred of Nara. Nara's halting story the other
night of the reason why she was late instantly
darted into Clare's mind, and here was the solution
of the mystery! And here also was the explana-
tion of Horsford's lack of warmth. The two
must have become acquainted!</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stephenson saw that Clare was terribly
upset, and attributed her distress to her being
personally associated with Nara's accident, and
after remarking by way of consolation that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Meldrum <q>had nothing to reproach herself with,</q>
that <q>no doubt the story was much exaggerated,</q>
and that the <q>girl was certain to be well looked
after,</q> bade Clare good-night, and went off to
talk the matter over with another of her lady
boarders.</p>

<p>In the meantime the ayah had taken the oppor-
tunity to steal away, but this did not matter now
to Clare, who returned to her room with faltering
steps. She closed and bolted the door mechanically
and stood for a few moments quivering from head
to foot, her nerves unhinged, her brain incapable
of grasping any idea clearly. Once more she
caught sight of her reflection in the mirror, and a
sudden revulsion of feeling seized her. In a frenzy
of passion she tore the jewels from her hair and
tugged at the involved tresses until they were
hanging dishevelled and tangled. She felt no
pain, though she had used all her strength, but
she was exhausted, and threw herself on the bed,
where she lay like one lifeless till morning broke.</p>

<head type="main">Nara's Warning</head>

<p><q>Slight concussion,</q> said the surgeon. <q>I don't
apprehend any danger, but she'll probably be un-
conscious for some hours. A very pretty girl.
English father, I should think, eh? Who is she?</q></p>

<p><q>I haven't the slightest notion. As you say,
doctor, she's extremely pretty, and possibly Eura-
sian,</q> said Horsford slowly.</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed on the pallid, harmonious
face, quite Eastern now that it was in repose. The
doctor's words <q>English father</q> had sent his
memory back five years.</p>

<p>The pillow was too high, the doctor thought,
and the nurse lifted the patient's head to with-
draw the bolster from beneath the pillow. The
<foreign xml:lang="hi">sari</foreign> was loose, and the portion which had served
to veil the girl's face had fallen about her neck.
The nurse, after putting the head in a comfortable
position, began arranging the folds of the <foreign xml:lang="hi">sari,</foreign>
and in so doing dragged out the locket which Nara
treasured so jealously.</p>

<p><q>Let me look at that, nurse,</q> said Horsford
quickly. One glance was enough.</p>

<p><q>Doctor!</q> he exclaimed, a little agitatedly,
<q>I believe I know the poor girl. If I'm right she
<pb n="246"/>
is the daughter of an old comrade who died at
Moodkee. Bring the lamp nearer, nurse.</q></p>

<p>The nurse obeyed, and he looked long and stead-
fastly at the beautiful face. Really, it had changed
very little. She might almost have been the
child who had fainted after the exhausting dance
before the Rajah of <choice><corr>Dakhur</corr><orig>Nakhur</orig></choice> and his guests. Her
Eastern origin was visible enough in the small,
sleek head and the full lips. The influence of her
mother had become more pronounced now that
she was on the threshold of womanhood.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> said Horsford, drawing a long breath,
<q>it is she. How she comes to be in Calcutta I
can neither explain nor understand.</q></p>

<p><q>Come into my room,</q> said the doctor, <q>and
we'll have a chat over a cigar. Nothing very
much can be done just now for the girl. We
must trust to Nature and her own vitality.</q></p>

<p>Christopher Pentreath was a good fellow, be-
sides being a good doctor. He had not lost the
ruggedness of Cornwall. He was blunt and plain-
speaking, and a man to be trusted. Horsford
instinctively felt this, and he had no hesitation
about opening his heart freely.</p>

<p><q>Humph,</q> said the doctor, after Horsford had
told his story. <q>Let me tell you, Colonel Hors-
ford, that you did a devilish risky thing, and you
were devilish fortunate in pulling it off as well as
you did. What became of the ayah who could
handle the <foreign xml:lang="hi">roomal</foreign> as well as the <foreign xml:lang="hi">saringhee</foreign>?</q></p>

<p><q>She died of cholera during the voyage to
England—so the lady who had the child in charge
wrote me in the letter I told you I had had from
her.</q></p>

<pb n="247"/>
<p><q>That was a bit of bad luck,</q> said the doctor,
shrugging his shoulders. <q>If the story should
leak out people will never believe a woman would
have strength enough to do what she did. I guess
the old rascal, despite his age, was tough and wiry.
You'd have some difficulty in clearing yourself.</q></p>

<p><q>You forget that I was disguised. No one
knew I was an Englishman. Anyhow, it's five
years ago, and in all probability the affair's for-
gotten.</q></p>

<p><q>I hope you're right, but when it comes to a
matter of revenge, the Easterns have plaguy long
memories. Anyhow, the romance as it stands is
a very pretty one. I only hope there won't be a
sequel. Adventure—mischief—God or the devil
knows what—follows a girl with a face like hers.
It haunts one. Wait till the lips are red once
more and she can use her eyes.</q></p>

<p><q>I know quite well what they're like. I haven't
forgotten,</q> rejoined Horsford drily. <q>By Jove,</q>
he added, looking at his watch, <q>it's two o'clock,
and I've an appointment with Lord Canning at
eight this morning.</q></p>

<p>Horsford walked to his hotel with the air of one
whose mind was absorbed by some deep anxiety.
Had he not been so preoccupied he might have
noticed that a man, tall, thin-faced, long-bearded,
in the filthy rags of a mendicant, followed him
wherever he went. This man had been in the
crowd when the accident happened, and had
shadowed the little procession to the hospital,
outside which he remained until Horsford reap-
peared. He now loitered near the hotel for a
time, as if to make sure the Sahib was staying
<pb n="248"/>
there, and not merely paying a visit, and then
made his way to the native quarter of the city.</p>

<p>Though the hour was late, and though he was
fatigued, Horsford wrote to Meldrum before he
went to bed. His letter was polite, even con-
ciliatory, despite its military brevity. All he con-
sidered necessary was an emphatic repetition of
his verbal statement that his meeting with Clare
was purely accidental. He declared solemnly that
he had not held the slightest communication with
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum since he quitted Simla five years
ago, and he wound up by demanding a withdrawal
of the offensive and grossly false insinuation
Meldrum had used towards him. What would
follow, supposing Meldrum refused, Horsford did
not bother to think. He was not one to meet
troubles half way.</p>

<p>He despatched the letter about seven o'clock
the next morning, and at eight presented him-
self at Government House. There he found an
anxious conclave.</p>

<p>It was the first week in March, 1857. Lord
Canning, succeeding Lord Dalhousie, had been
Governor-General exactly a year, and though
nothing definite had happened to cause anxiety
there were disquieting rumours of discontent,
especially in Oudh and in Delhi. The episode of
the Brahmin, who at the Dum-Dum cantonments
spread the story of the intention of the British
Government to issue cartridges smeared with beef
fat and hog's lard, was now some six weeks old,
and the panic it created among the Hindu Sepoys
had by no means subsided. Oudh was in a state
of simmering rebellion, but Sir Henry Lawrence
<pb n="249"/>
had been despatched to Lucknow, and it was
believed that so firm and wise an administrator
would soon restore order. All was quiet in Delhi,
but with such a mistress of intrigue as Zeenut
Mehal at the head of affairs anything might happen.</p>

<p>The conference to which Horsford had been
invited was called to consider a very important
and unpleasant item of news which had just come
from Burhampore. It was reported that the
19th Infantry had shown signs of gross insub-
ordination on February 27. Lord Canning
announced that it was decided to disband the
regiment, and that orders had been sent to march
the troops for that purpose to Barrackpore, where
the 34th were quartered.</p>

<p>These two regiments had formerly been stationed
at Lucknow, but after the deposition of the King
of Oudh in 1856 they became so disaffected that
it was considered prudent to separate them.
One regiment was accordingly sent to Burham-
pore and the other to Barrackpore. It was hoped
that the disbanding of the 19th would stop further
trouble, but Lord Canning, like a good many
other men with more experience of India than he
had, did not realise the storm that was gathering.
No one, of course, could have foreseen that on
March 29 a sepoy of the 34th regiment and a
religious enthusiast, Mungul Pandy by name,
would, when intoxicated, run amok and uninten-
tionally set light to the torch of rebellion that
before six weeks were passed would be waved
from the Punjaub to Bengal.</p>

<p>The conference lasted two hours, and the chief
subject of discussion was the position of affairs
<pb n="250"/>
in Delhi. However much men of Indian experi-
ence differed in regard to British rule, they all
agreed on one point: that whoever held Delhi held
also India. Throughout the terribly anxious
months of the Mutiny this was the central thought
of every Englishman in India. So when it was
known in the early part of '57 that Zeenut Mehal's
emissaries were moving stealthily from province
to province, the authorities felt that if it was
necessary to be watchful anywhere, the city of
Shah Jahan was the place. Information had in
some way reached Lord Canning that Guy Hors-
ford had intimate knowledge of Delhi, its court
and its people, which would be invaluable during
the uncertainty which prevailed, and after much
talk Horsford left the conference entrusted with
an important mission. He was to start at once
for Delhi and make a secret and independent
report of the state of affairs, especially in regard
to Zeenut Mehal's doings. As for her husband,
the aged King, Bahadur Shah, he was of no ac-
count; he was but a pawn in the game.</p>

<p>The mission was one quite to Horsford's taste.
It was full of risk, it demanded tact and adroit-
ness, and it might necessitate all his powers of
dissimulation and disguise. But there was one
serious drawback. He was required to start at
once, and there was so much which ought to
detain him at Calcutta. Until the embarrassment
concerning Clare was settled Meldrum would be
certain to put a wrong construction upon his
hasty departure. It might be said that he had
gone because he was afraid. Such a possibility
was unthinkable. Then there was Nara! What
<pb n="251"/>
was he to do about her? Never was a man so
torn by the antagonism between his personal re-
sponsibilities and his duty as a soldier; but the
matter was not one to be argued, and whatever
might be thought and said about him he must
carry out his orders.</p>

<p>Full of this determination he went to the
railway station to ascertain the time of the trains.
Raniganj was as far as he could travel by rail;
he would have to pursue the rest of the journey
to Delhi by <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">dâk</foreign>. He found the morning train had
gone, and the next started at six o'clock that
evening. He determined to go by this, and after
sending a telegram to the <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">dâk</foreign> agent at Raniganj
to have runners and palanquin in readiness, he
set out to return to his hotel, resolving to call at
the hospital on his way.</p>

<p>It was the busiest time of the morning and the
streets were thronged. The ragged mendicant
who had dogged Horsford's footsteps the previous
evening and at an early hour that morning, had
no difficulty in following the Englishman wherever
he went. He had posted himself in the street
where Horsford's hotel was situated as soon as
day broke; he had seen Horsford come out, and
he had shadowed him to Government House and
thence to the railway station. Had he been
Horsford's double he could not have pursued him
closer or more persistently.</p>

<p>At the hospital Horsford met <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pentreath
and anxiously inquired after Nara.</p>

<p><q>Better,</q> was the reply. <q>Brain gradually
becoming normal. The nurse says that when she
told her you'd come to-day the prettiest smile
<pb n="252"/>
ever seen came into her face. You'll have to be
careful, Colonel Horsford,</q> went on the doctor
chaffingly. <q>Nurse Barton swears the girl's in
love with you. I dare say she's right. Women
are deuced sharp in reading one another's secrets
in that direction.</q></p>

<p>Horsford bit his lips in vexation. Everything
seemed to be conspiring against him. Apparently
it was his fate to be plagued by the eternal
feminine. Strange for one who cared so little for
women! So he had often told himself. He had
hoped that he might have been able to set out on
his journey without any fresh embarrassment on
Nara's account. He could not but believe that
the girl was in charge of English people in Calcutta
—friends it might be of her aunt—and that she
would be properly looked after.</p>

<p>The doctor had been called away, and Horsford
had time to argue the matter with himself. A step
was heard. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pentreath bustled into the room.</p>

<p><q>I've had a look at your <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">protégée</foreign>, Colonel Hors-
ford. She is awake and, everything considered,
fairly strong. Strangely worried about you,
though, but brightened up amazingly when I said
you were here and waiting to see her.</q></p>

<p>Horsford shrugged his shoulders with an air of
resignation. What was the use of fighting against
fate? Resolutions and plans were powerless in
the face of the force of circumstances, of coinci-
dences, of the unexpected.</p>

<p><q>Very well,</q> said he, <q>I'll stay a minute or
two. I've a tremendous lot to do to-day. I
leave Calcutta this evening for Delhi.</q></p>

<p><q>The deuce! That's quick work. You haven't
<pb n="253"/>
been more than three days in Calcutta, you told
me.</q></p>

<p><q>Quite true. I'd not the least idea last night
my stay would be short.</q></p>

<p><q>Nothing amiss, eh?</q> said the doctor, drop-
ping his voice.</p>

<p><q>No; nothing beyond the Burhampore trouble.</q></p>

<p><q>I hope that won't be followed by anything
else. I can't explain it, but there seems to be
great uneasiness everywhere. India is a queer
country. One has forebodings here totally un-
known in any other part of the world. What I
mean is that if anything evil is about to happen,
it throws its shadow before in some uncanny
fashion. Have you ever noticed that?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. India is the land of fate—or to put the
matter in another form, in India one becomes a
fatalist.</q></p>

<p><q>If you mean, Colonel, that apprehensive of
coming misfortunes you must sit down and do
nothing, I don't agree with you.</q></p>

<p><q>I should never suggest anything so absurd.
Anyhow, for the moment we're talking in the
clouds, so we needn't pursue the subject. As
you've told the girl I'm here, I'd better see her
and get it done with.</q></p>

<p><q>All right. I can see you're steeled against
the magic of a romantic face,</q> said the doctor
laughingly. <q>Come along. You may be trusted
—especially as you're going away.</q></p>

<p>Long before Horsford reached the ward where
Nara was lying she knew he was coming, and in
spite of the nurse's remonstrances she insisted
upon sitting up in the bed. Her beauty was
<pb n="254"/>
enhanced by the sparkle of her eyes and the faint
glow in her cheeks, signs of excitement which in-
creased the nurse's concern. But Nara would listen
to nothing. She had caught sight of Horsford and
she extended her hands imploringly.</p>

<p><q>Sahib—Sahib—you——</q></p>

<p>Her voice died away in a throb. She sank back
panting and quivering.</p>

<p><q>I told you what would happen if you got
excited,</q> whispered the nurse a little angrily.
<q>You're doing yourself no good. What will the
Sahib think?</q></p>

<p>The last admonition probably had its effect.
Nara suddenly became calm. But the nervous
twitching of her lips showed that the tempest of
emotion had not passed away. When Horsford
reached her she was lying quietly. He had not
seen her momentary excitement, her outstretched
hands, her flushed face. He sat down by her
bedside and rested his hand on hers.</p>

<p><q>I knew you would come,</q> she whispered.
<q>Oh, I have thought of you many—many times.</q>
She drew a deep breath and went on. <q>I have
prayed night and morning that we might meet
again and felt that my prayers would come true.
God has sent me here to save you. Sahib—Sahib
—I want to tell you something—bend your head,
please. No one else must hear.</q></p>

<p>Her yearning eyes, her vibrating voice, in which
it seemed to him there was a note of terror, affected
Horsford strangely. He obeyed her.</p>

<p><q>You are in terrible danger, Sahib,</q> she whis-
pered agitatedly. <q>You have bitter, treacherous
enemies. I overheard them talking about you
<pb n="255"/>
but they did not see me. Oh, I was thankful I
understood their language. It was what some of
the girls with—with Sundra Bai used to speak,
and I learned it of them.</q></p>

<p>Nara told her story brokenly, and Horsford
listened in amazement.</p>

<p><q>So I'm tracked, am I?</q> he muttered, his lips
tightening, <q>thanks to Kulloo Bux. Poor beggar!
I'm sorry, but it's not wonderful the torture was
too much for him.</q></p>

<p>It was all serious enough, but the gravest part
of the story was that which inferred the existence
of a plot in which the maintenance of the English
supremacy in India was concerned. It was dis-
appointing that Nara could tell him so little on
this point; but certainly it was definite enough
that Sundra Bai's revenge on him was to be de-
layed until after something had happened in June.
His duty, however, was clear; he must go straight
to Lord Canning and convey what he had heard.
He would have risen from his chair by the bedside,
but Nara guessed his intention and convulsively
clasped his hand between both hers.</p>

<p><q>Sahib—Sahib,</q> she cried imploringly, <q>don't
leave me. If you go I shall be wretched. It
would break my heart if anything happened to
you. You don't know the wickedness of Sundra
Bai. <emph>I</emph> do. I've seen it many and many a time.
She never forgives. No—no——</q></p>

<p>He was trying to withdraw his hand, but her
fingers had twined round it like little snakes.
He succeeded in getting free, however, and she
sank back exhausted.</p>

<p><q>You're frightening yourself without a cause,
<pb n="256"/>
Nara,</q> said Horsford gently. <q>I'm not afraid of
a hundred Sundra Bais. I shall come and see
you again.</q></p>

<p><q>When—when——</q> she burst out.</p>

<p><q>Very soon. This afternoon, perhaps. While
I am away I must see what I can do to make sure
that you return to England. It's the only place
of safety for you.</q></p>

<p><q>No. I shall not go,</q> she cried, with sudden
desperation. <q>I hate England. I was so un-
happy there. I only want to be where you are,
Sahib,</q> she went on, sinking her voice.</p>

<p><q>You mustn't be foolish. Can't you see that
what you ask is impossible? You must be good,
Nara, and do as I say.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes—yes—I will try,</q> she murmured.</p>

<p><q>Very well then, rest quietly until I return. I
suppose you don't want to go back to Sundra Bai
and dancing?</q></p>

<p><q>No—no. God forbid!</q> she cried.</p>

<p><q>Good! Then I'll see what I can do for you
when I come back.</q></p>

<p>His voice softened. It was useless to attempt
to be harsh with her. He saw she was anxious to
please—to obey him. He was turning away when
a moment of weakness seized him. He could not
resist the yearning, beseeching look in the big eyes.
He bent down and kissed her. There was no
harm. He was twelve years older than she, and
though she was seventeen she was but a child.
No, there was no harm, he told himself. For all
that he walked quickly away, as though he had
done something for which he ought to be sorry.</p>

<p>Horsford was fortunate in finding Lord Canning
<pb n="257"/>
disengaged. The Governor-General heard what
he had to say but did not seem to attach much
importance to the story. It came to him as no
novelty. He had heard rumours of something
which was intended to take place somewhere near
the date of the centenary of the battle of Plassy,
but there was nothing definite, nor was any par-
ticular locality indicated as a centre of danger.
He saw no reason to alter his plans about Hors-
ford's mission to Delhi.</p>

<p><q>But two of the plotters are in Calcutta—ought
they not to be discovered and watched?</q> ob-
jected Horsford. <q>I would respectfully suggest
that this woman Sundra Bai be arrested, or at
least detained while inquiries are being made.</q></p>

<p><q>By all means, if she can be discovered. It's
some days, you tell me, since the Eurasian girl
saw her—she may have left Calcutta by this time.
Anyhow, you had better see the officer who has
such matters in charge.</q></p>

<p>The Governor-General scribbled a few lines on
a slip of paper which he gave to Horsford. The
paper contained instructions for the secret inquiry
department to take Colonel Horsford's informa-
tion and act upon it if necessary.</p>

<p><q>You will start for Delhi just the same, Colonel
Horsford,</q> said Lord Canning. <q>Possibly Sundra
Bai means to return to Zeenut Mehal and report.
Evidently she's one of the Queen's spies. It's as
well that you know her—you will be forewarned in
case you run across her in Delhi.</q></p>

<p>The interview with the secret inquiry officer did
not have any important result. The official de-
cided that he ought to have Nara's story from her
<pb n="258"/>
own lips before he could do anything. To this
Horsford could make no reasonable objection.
Probably Nara had more to tell if she were skilfully
questioned. Horsford went away, by no means
satisfied in his mind, and that which troubled him
most was that duty compelled him to leave the
girl to her fate.</p>

<p>It was past midday. Horsford meant to visit
the hospital again, but in the meantime he decided
to go to his hotel, pack up a few necessaries, and
have them sent to the railway station. The
manager of the hotel met him in the entrance hall.</p>

<p><q>A lady is waiting to see you, sir,</q> said the
manager. <q>She would not tell me her name.</q></p>

<p><q>Clare—for a thousand pounds,</q> muttered
Horsford, biting his lips. <q>How horribly im-
prudent of her. What's happened now? I'm in
a confoundedly awkward coil—a coil that for the
moment I don't see how to get out of. Where is
the lady?</q> he asked aloud.</p>

<p><q>In your rooms, sir.</q></p>

<p><q>In <emph>my</emph> rooms!</q> cried Horsford, staggered.
<q>What on earth made you show her there?</q></p>

<p><q>The lady insisted, sir. She said she was a
very old friend of yours.</q></p>

<p>A doubt crossed Horsford's mind. Perhaps it
was not Clare after all. He asked the manager
to describe her.</p>

<p><q>Well, I can't. She had her veil down. I
could just see that she was fair.</q></p>

<p>Horsford shrugged his shoulders. The meagre
description was reminiscent of Clare. He strode
on, prepared for the worst. He had faced the
enemy with less misgivings than he felt now.</p>

<head type="main">The Heart of a Woman</head>

<p>The visitor had her back towards Horsford when
he entered the room, and she remained motionless,
though she must have heard the door open. She
did not even turn when he approached her. Of
course it was Clare. He could not mistake the
symmetrical shoulders, the lithe figure, the erect
carriage of the head. The defiance, the self-asser-
tion suggested by her attitude were in striking
contrast to the gentle girl of the East. It was
inevitable that he should at that moment think
of Nara. The tender affection written in the girl's
eyes, in every accent of her soft, liquid voice, was
fresh in his memory.</p>

<p>He came to a dead stop when within a pace or
so of the statuesque figure, and waited silently.
Quite thirty seconds went by, and she jerked
herself round impatiently.</p>

<p>He was amazed at the change he could see in
her. She was unusually pale—her lips indeed were
white—there were symptoms of dark curves be-
neath the eyes, and the eyes themselves shone with
a hard, metallic light.</p>

<p><q>Why don't you speak to me, Guy?</q> she
cried huskily. <q>Can't you see—don't you know
<pb n="260"/>
that you're the only one in the world I can appeal
to? I came to ask your help—of course you were
not to blame for being out, but waiting for you to
return got on my nerves. I've been here an hour,
and it has been an eternity. I thought it would
never come to an end, and now—you—you say
nothing. Oh—oh.&#x2026;</q></p>

<p>She suddenly broke down. Her highly strung
nervous system reached the last point of tension.
She burst into a passionate fit of hysterical sobbing.
Horsford was terribly pained, but in Clare's ex-
cited state to ask for an explanation was, he knew,
useless. He led her gently to the couch and
persuaded her to sit quietly for a time.</p>

<p>Clare was not a woman to be soothed in a mo-
ment—Horsford could see this plainly enough, and
he did not express any pity or sympathy. He rang
the bell and went into the corridor and waited
until a servant came. Then he ordered a bottle
of champagne. He did not return until the wine
was brought, and he took it into the room himself.</p>

<p>The storm was subsiding. Clare's lips were
quivering, her eyes were red and swollen, but the
hysterical sobbing had ceased. She looked at him
wildly, despairingly, almost dazed. It was doubtful
whether she had been conscious of his absence.
Horsford took no notice of her but opened the
champagne. There was something prosaic and
worldly in the sound of the popping cork which
acted as a counter-irritant to her exalted feelings.
At first she refused the wine, but Horsford peremp-
torily ordered her to drink it, and she obeyed
almost meekly. As it happened Horsford had
done the right thing. Her shattered condition
<pb n="261"/>
was due not only to her harassed mind and to her
uncontrolled emotions, but also to the fact that
since seven o'clock the previous evening she had
eaten nothing.</p>

<p><q>Thank you,</q> Horsford heard her say in a faint
voice.</p>

<p><q>Now let's talk quietly,</q> said he. <q>What's
amiss?</q></p>

<p><q>I've left my husband for ever. I won't go
back—not that he's ever likely to ask me. I
fancy I've made that impossible. At all events
I want it to be so. I've told him the truth.</q></p>

<p>Horsford could make no reply. He was stag-
gered. For a moment he thought Clare had taken
leave of her senses. But there was no sign of
derangement in those clear, steady eyes. Her
excitement had passed. Evidently she had come
with the intention of confessing to him what she
had done, and the accomplishment of her task
had been accompanied by a reaction which left
her with the abnormal composure of despair.</p>

<p><q>And how much of the truth does that mean?</q>
Horsford asked slowly.</p>

<p><q>All—your share as well as mine. There was
nothing else to be done. Andrew called on me
this morning, and began by telling me he had had
your letter and that he did not believe what you
said in it about our meeting here being accidental.</q></p>

<p><q>But it was,</q> cried Horsford vehemently.
<q>Did you not tell him so?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. I said you were innocent—that we
hadn't heard from each other for five years—that
you hadn't the slightest idea I was in Calcutta
when you threw up your appointment in Pegu—
<pb n="262"/>
that you didn't even know I was married. Oh, I
fought for you, Guy. I did you justice. I returned
good for evil.</q></p>

<p><q>Evil?</q> faltered Horsford. <q>What have I
done to you that was evil?</q></p>

<p>She looked at him steadily, with an ironic light
in her eyes.</p>

<p><q>You &#x2026; left me.</q></p>

<p><q>And was that why you married Meldrum?
You needn't have done so.</q></p>

<p><q>I thought it best. You gave me no hope in
the letter you wrote from Delhi that you would
ever see me again—that you wanted to see me
again.</q></p>

<p><q>The chances were against our meeting. No
one knew how the Burmese war was going to turn
out. There were not many casualties, it is true,
but there was plenty of fever. Apparently you
had cast me off, and I was anxious you should be
free.</q></p>

<p><q>Free? How could I ever be free? What is
it that chains us? Thought—memory—regret—
disappointment.</q></p>

<p>Horsford made no answer. He felt that Clare
in a way was right.</p>

<p><q>We needn't go into the old story. It doesn't
matter who was to blame. The world would say
I was the sinner. The world can say what it
likes. It may have plenty to talk about soon,</q>
she went on.</p>

<p>Horsford still remained silent. Clare's reckless-
ness, her persistency in recalling the past and
ignoring their separation, which he had always
regarded as one they had mutually agreed to,
<pb n="263"/>
appalled him. Argument, reason, commonsense
were powerless against her femininity.</p>

<p><q>Yes, I told him everything,</q> she went on in
a dogged, impassive manner. <q>It was the only
thing to do. I did not want him to be under a
false impression. And I felt I could no longer go
on acting the lie against which I've been struggling
for the last five years. He wanted to know why
I had come to Calcutta. A good many people—
you yourself, Guy, though you didn't say it in so
many words—have wondered why. I said that
it was in order to meet you.</q></p>

<p><q>Me? That was a lie,</q> burst out Guy furiously.
<q>How could you say such a thing? God in
Heaven, that you——</q></p>

<p><q>No, no. You mustn't say a word until you've
heard all,</q> she implored, holding her hand against
his lips. <q>Haven't I told you I did you justice?
As God is my judge, Guy, I am speaking the truth.
Accidentally I read in an Indian paper I saw
in London that you were leaving Pegu for an
appointment in Calcutta, and I could not resist
the temptation of coming to see you.</q></p>

<p><q>You confessed all this to your husband?</q>
demanded Horsford chokingly.</p>

<p><q>Yes. But I also said that you knew nothing
of my intention.</q></p>

<p><q>And did he believe you?</q></p>

<p><q>No.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course not. No man in his senses would,</q>
cried Horsford, in a bitter tone.</p>

<p>Clare's incredible folly unnerved him. He
walked up and down the room overwhelmed.
Never in his life had he imagined that he would
<pb n="264"/>
come to hate a woman, and one so beautiful and
fascinating as Clare. The next moment he re-
proached himself for having used the word <q>hate</q>
even mentally. How could he hate one who
looked so dejected, so lonely and helpless as Clare
looked at that moment? Pity was the proper
feeling. But neither pity nor hate would aid him
to solve the difficulty of the future? What was
in Clare's mind in paying him this embarrassing
visit after her fatal confession to her husband?</p>

<p>He stopped in front of her abruptly.</p>

<p><q>What do you intend to do now that you're
alone?</q> he asked.</p>

<p><q>That's a question, Guy, <emph>you</emph> ought to be able
to answer,</q> said she, in a low voice, and with her
eyes cast down.</p>

<p><q>I'd rather have the answer from your lips,
Clare.</q></p>

<p><q>How cruel you are! You were cruel when you
left me. You are cruel now. You want to
humiliate me as you humiliated me five years
ago.</q></p>

<p><q>Humiliate you?</q> he cried hastily. <q>What
madness! When did I humiliate you?</q></p>

<p><q>When you compelled me to write to Delhi
begging you to return to me. Don't think I
regret the letter, for it told you what was in
my heart, but it was a humiliation all the
same. What happened afterwards? Five years
of wretchedness for me, a life of freedom, of
activity for you.</q></p>

<p><q>But it was your own choice that you married
Meldrum. I was not to blame for that.</q></p>

<p><q>How like the reasoning of a man! He helps
<pb n="265"/>
to place a woman in circumstances from which
there's but one way of escape for her, and she
alone is in fault! At the time I felt I could do
nothing else but marry. Fear drove me into it.</q></p>

<p>Horsford was silent. There was force in her
reasoning.</p>

<p><q>You ask me what I intend to do now that I'm
alone,</q> she went on. <q>I don't know. I seem
enveloped in darkness. I want you to guide me.
Whom can I come to but you?</q></p>

<p>Not a word could Horsford say. He was as
much in darkness as she. Clare approached him
almost timidly, clasped his arm with both hands,
and looked up into his eyes.</p>

<p><q>I've left my husband because of you, Guy.
Isn't that claim sufficient? Am I to suffer by
myself?</q></p>

<p><q>No,</q> he returned quickly. <q>That's the last
thing I wish. I'm not reproaching you. I've not
the ghost of a right to do <emph>that</emph>—but why did you
make that terrible confession?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, it was inevitable,</q> she answered, with
perfect composure. <q>Not only because of last
night, but because it was <emph>my</emph> answer to my hus-
band's letter I told you about. I've brought it
with me. I want you to read it.</q></p>

<p><q>I'd rather not. How can it concern me?</q></p>

<p><q>It does. You must.</q></p>

<p>Agitatedly she drew the letter from her pocket
and thrust it into his hand. When he had mastered
the contents he could see how they must have
galled Clare's proud spirit. To be called a well-
dressed doll and by her husband! The offence
was unforgivable.</p>

<pb n="266"/>
<p><q>Meldrum ought never to have written that,</q>
said he slowly.</p>

<p><q>I'm glad he did. Can't you see it gave me a
cause of quarrel? What do I care now for his
insults? Everything has happened for the best.
Haven't I met <emph>you</emph>, Guy?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, you've met me,</q> he repeated, drawing a
long breath. <q>And the devil is with us, too.
I'm off to Delhi this evening.</q></p>

<p><q>Delhi? Then I'll go with you! Delhi of all
places! Meldrum's home is there. What a
triumph for me!</q></p>

<p><q>My God, Clare, you're mad! Scandal won't
affect me—it slips off a man's back pretty easily,
but it sticks to a woman, whatever part of the
world she may be in. I can't prevent you going
to Delhi by yourself, but <emph>with</emph> me—for Heaven's
sake think twice!</q></p>

<p><q>Think? Haven't I been thinking for the last
five years? I'm not blind to my own nature.
I'm lost if I haven't the companionship of a man
who's congenial to me. I'm not going back to
my husband, that's certain, and if you cast me off
—Guy——</q></p>

<p>She suddenly altered her tone, and her manner
with it. The first was hard, the second aggressive.
She continued:</p>

<p><q>When we separated our difference—I can
hardly call it a quarrel—was over a dancing-girl.
You preached about saving her from a horrible
life. What about <emph>my</emph> life, Guy? What will you
do to save <emph>me</emph>?</q></p>

<p><q>The dancing-girl was but a child.</q></p>

<p><q>That isn't the point. If you thought it right
<pb n="267"/>
to save a girl from shame how much more anxious
you ought to be to save a woman—and one
who——</q></p>

<p>Her voice quivered, and she turned her head
away.</p>

<p><q>You mean, I suppose, that you've cut yourself
adrift, and that you've now nothing to live upon.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't mean anything of the kind. The
balance of my settlement isn't so small as Andrew's
letter might lead you to imagine. Lawton and
his friends would have robbed me—you know
how easily cheating can be done over horse-racing
—and I took precautions. I purposely withdrew
a large sum from the bank and invested it in
English securities. Andrew chose to pay my
debts, but I dare say he was thinking more of
his own credit than mine. I've enough to live
upon. That's nothing. Can't you realise what
my position is?</q></p>

<p><q>It was your own doing,</q> said Horsford gloomily.</p>

<p><q>Put it that way, if you like. It's too late to
trouble about fixing one's responsibility. I know
what awaits me. I didn't travel alone for a year
without discovering what men think of women
who are <soCalled>unattached.</soCalled> They're prey to be
pursued. I could take care of myself then—you
were ever in my mind, Guy. But if you discard
me—I suppose you have a right—I can't say what
may happen.</q></p>

<p><q>You don't mean this for a threat, do you,
Clare?</q> said Horsford, after a pause.</p>

<p><q>No. I'm simply telling you what I'm sure
will follow. Of course, I've come across well-
dressed men of charming manners who were
<pb n="268"/>
scoundrels all the same. They abound in foreign
hotels. I've learned to tell that kind of man at
a glance. But there are others, rich, generous,
well-meaning and—foolish. Do you suppose I
couldn't have made them fall in love with me had
I chosen? But they didn't interest me, and I
looked upon them with indifference, not because
of my husband, but because of you. And if you
leave me I shall go straight to rack and ruin. I
know myself too well.</q></p>

<p>A long silence followed. Clare's eyes, wild,
dilated, like those of a prisoner awaiting the
verdict of the jury, were fixed on Horsford. At
last he spoke.</p>

<p><q>You shall have your way, Clare,</q> said he very
quietly. <q>As you said, it's too late to talk about
fixing responsibility. For the future I answer for
you. Just now, at all events, we'd better be
practical.</q> He looked at his watch. <q>It's three
o'clock. At six I start for Raniganj. If you can
catch the same train well and good. If not come
by the first train to-morrow, and you will find
I've made arrangements at Raniganj to travel by
<foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">dâk</foreign> to Delhi.</q></p>

<p><q>Won't you wait for me at Raniganj?</q> she
pleaded.</p>

<p><q>No. I want you to understand clearly that
whatever happens the first thing is my duty. I
must obey orders, and those orders are to reach
Delhi with all possible despatch. Nothing—not
even you, Clare—must stand in the way.</q></p>

<p><q>You misjudge me, Guy, if you think I'm
going to be a burden. I only want to be near you
—to talk with you when we can—to know that
<pb n="269"/>
we're friends. I'll do anything you ask me. It
shall be as you say. I'll follow you to-morrow.
Good-bye. You'll be glad to get rid of me.</q></p>

<p>She lifted her eyes imploringly. He read the
meaning of the yearning look. He kissed her, and
the kiss would have been a cold one but that she
flung her arms about his neck. He could feel her
throbbing.</p>

<p><q>I love you, dear,</q> she whispered brokenly.
<q>I've always loved you. I shall love you to the
end, whatever that end may be.</q></p>

<p>She clung to him convulsively, and then tore
herself away.</p>

<p><q>Whatever that end may be,</q> repeated Hors-
ford to himself mechanically when he was alone.</p>

<p>He stood for a few seconds in a kind of reverie,
and then, shrugging his shoulders as one who
meant to take things philosophically and make
the best of them, he summoned his servant, and
for the next half-hour busied himself in the work
of packing.</p>

<p>Again Horsford was at the hospital and was
taken direct to the doctor's room—<abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pentreath
had given orders to that effect.</p>

<p><q>I'm glad you've come, Colonel Horsford,</q>
said the bluff doctor. <q>I want to speak straight
to you. I don't know how you regard that in-
teresting <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">protégée</foreign> of yours—it's no affair of mine,
and all I'm concerned about is the girl as a
patient. It's my duty to do the best I can for
her. She's horribly harassed in her mind and
quite likely as not to do something desperate.
Her brain isn't working normally, and won't while
she's thinking about you. It's no use beating
<pb n="270"/>
about the bush—the poor child's madly in love
with you, and the less she sees of you the better.
I'll have a talk with her and explain that you've
been ordered off to Delhi.</q></p>

<p><q>It would be at once the truth and the best
thing to do. Look here, doctor, I'm going to ask
a favour of you. I want you to keep Nara here
in some capacity, it doesn't matter what—I think
you'll find her useful. I don't want you to pay
her—that is to say, out of the funds of the hospital.
I'll arrange that with you and subscribe some-
thing to the funds besides. You understand the
interest I take in her, don't you?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, certainly,</q> said the doctor drily. It
seemed to him quite natural. The beauty of the
girl was a sufficient reason.</p>

<p><q>Then it's settled, I take it. Her appointment
will only be temporary. I expect to be back in
Calcutta in May, and then I will consider what's
to be done.</q></p>

<p><q>There's no harm in the notion,</q> said the
doctor; <q>at the same time if it doesn't work out
to your satisfaction, don't blame me.</q></p>

<p><q>I won't. I'm sure you'll do your best.</q></p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said, and Horsford
hurried away, by no means easy in his mind. He
had voluntarily loaded himself with fetters from
which he could not possibly get free. The position
was as false as it was bound to be embarrassing
and compromising. The worst of it was that he
could give no explanation, and if he could no one
would believe him. There was no man in the
train that steamed out of Calcutta that evening
so silent and absorbed as Colonel Guy Horsford.</p>

<pb n="271"/>
<p>Meanwhile the doctor had fulfilled his promise.
He gave Nara Horsford's message. She listened
quietly, and then shook her head.</p>

<p><q>No—no. I won't stay unless the Sahib tells
me with his own lips. Why doesn't he come to
see me? He said he would. Let him tell me
himself.</q></p>

<p><q>Quite impossible, my dear. Colonel Horsford
was obliged to leave Calcutta, and by this time
he is on his way to Delhi.</q></p>

<p><q>To Delhi? Oh——</q></p>

<p>A look of fright was in her eyes. The exclama-
tion came from her lips in a long-drawn sigh.</p>

<p><q>So you see,</q> went on the doctor, <q>you must
please him by your obedience, and wait patiently
for his return in two months' time. Do you
understand?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> he heard her say in a sad whisper.</p>

<p><q>I've done the best I could for Horsford,</q>
thought the doctor. <q>At the same time, I hate
working in the dark. I'll bet there's a lot more
in this affair that Colonel Horsford's kept to him-
self. I'd like to know what it is.</q></p>

<p>The good doctor was not destined to have his
curiosity satisfied; on the contrary it was to be
further excited. Early the next morning the
nurse knocked at his door and came in, looking
very agitated.</p>

<p><q>If you please, sir, a most extraordinary thing's
happened—but it was no fault of mine—I was not
on night duty—I——</q></p>

<p><q>Well?</q> said the doctor sharply.</p>

<p><q>The girl—the ayah you gave me instructions
about last night—is gone.</q></p>

<pb n="272"/>
<p><q>Gone? Gone where?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know, sir. She must have escaped by
the window in the night. The night nurse says
she was called to the Nightingale Ward, and the
girl must have taken the opportunity to slip out.
Nurse says she was only away five minutes, and
when she came back it did not occur to her to
look at the bed, and so nothing was known until
I went in this morning as usual.</q></p>

<p>News indeed, but not surprising. It only con-
firmed the doctor's conviction that Horsford had
not told him all. But he had no time to think the
matter out, for at that moment a card was brought
to him by the hall porter. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum had
called.</p>

<p><q>I must see this lady. About the girl, nurse,
if she's really gone I don't know that we can do
anything, but I'll look into the matter presently.</q></p>

<p>The nurse departed and Clare was ushered into
the room. She was looking her best. Whatever
might be in store for her, she felt at that moment
in an exaltation of spirits to which she had long
been a stranger. She had not carried out her
dream of fascinating Guy Horsford a second time
—of bringing him to her feet; but she was free
from the hateful fetters imposed upon her by her
marriage with Meldrum. Not, indeed, legally free,
but for this she cared little. Before a woman's
will and a woman's heart the law was powerless.
She never thought of Guy Horsford's position.
It did not matter how she had compromised him
and herself. She was blind to the consequences
of her wilfulness. If she reflected at all on the
situation it was with a sense of relief that
<pb n="273"/>
the heart-burnings, the bitterness, the regrets, the
folly—regrets that seemed vain, and folly which
appeared irremediable—of the last five years were
gone. She had no longer any fear about Horsford,
she had bound him to her by a link stronger than
that of love—the link of honour.</p>

<p>So it was natural that the freshness, the gaiety
of her young days should dawn once more, and
the sharpness that of late had crept into her voice
begin to soften. It was with quite her old charm
of manner and gracious smile that she made known
her errand to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pentreath.</p>

<p><q>It is curious that you should come at this
moment, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum,</q> said the doctor. <q>A
strange discovery has just been made. The girl
has disappeared. I'm unable to tell you more
than that at present. The nurse who had her in
charge thinks she made her escape by the window,
and it may be so. The sill is but some ten feet
from the ground. But I haven't had time to
make inquiries. However, if you like to wait
while I do so, I may be able to tell you more.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm afraid I can't stay. My train starts in
half an hour. I'm going to Delhi. I thought I
would like to know how the poor girl was going
on. It so happens that she came from England
with me, but I only engaged her for the voyage,
and she was virtually out of my service when the
accident happened, but of course that would make
no difference. I want to do what is right.</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly. I may say that I've had a mes-
sage to a similar effect from <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum, but
no doubt you're aware of that.</q></p>

<p><q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum—oh yes——</q></p>

<pb n="274"/>
<p>Clare was confused for a moment or two, and
then recovering herself, said:</p>

<p><q>Have you any idea why she left the hospital?</q></p>

<p><q>Not the slightest. I suppose you can't throw
any light upon the mystery, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, I had my suspicions she had a sweet-
heart in Calcutta. Indeed, I was obliged to
reprimand her on that account. She was so
neglectful. It may be he was a soldier and was
going away. By the way, it was Colonel Horsford
who rescued her, wasn't it?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. Do you know him?</q></p>

<p><q>Very well indeed. We were old friends in
Simla five years ago.</q></p>

<p><q>Then I dare say you've heard of the strange
romance of the pretty dancing-girl in which he
was concerned.</q></p>

<p><q>I believe there was some talk of the kind.
What of it?</q></p>

<p>Clare's voice had suddenly become harsh. She
had never expected such a test of her powers of
self-possession as this. Her object in calling at
the hospital was simply to observe the conven-
tionalities. It was, of course, bound to be known
that the injured girl was her ayah, and what
would people say if she made no inquiries? True,
a pang of jealousy had seized her when she thought
how Horsford might admire Nara, but as he had
gone to Delhi there was nothing to trouble about.
The unsuspecting doctor went on.</p>

<p><q>Well, it turns out that your ayah is the heroine
of his romance. She's the daughter of an old
comrade of his who was killed at Moodkee. The
story's too long to tell in all its details—indeed I
<pb n="275"/>
shouldn't have mentioned it but for the fact
that you and Colonel Horsford are old friends—
but the gist is that he managed to get the girl to
England. How she came back you, of course,
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum, know better than I do.</q></p>

<p>Clare hardly paid attention to what Pentreath
was saying. A hundred confused thoughts were
agitating her. The room had suddenly become
suffocating. She rose, declined the suggestion that
she should wait until inquiries were made about
Nara's strange disappearance, and with difficulty
maintained her self-command while the doctor
escorted her down the staircase.</p>

<p>She hurried back to the boarding-house and
shut herself in her own room. All the emotional
struggles she had gone through since that fateful
night in Simla were nothing in comparison to this
which now convulsed her whole being. It seemed
to her that the perfidy of Guy Horsford was made
evident. No doubt he had kept up a corres-
pondence with Nara during the last five years, and
it followed that it was an arranged thing she
should meet him at Calcutta. Nara's absence on
the night of the concert and her constant desire
to get out were now accounted for. It was also
clear why Horsford refused to travel with her
(Clare) to Delhi. Of course he wanted her rival
for his companion and the girl had run away from
the hospital to join him!</p>

<p>Clare remained in her room the entire day,
surrendering herself to the bitterest pangs a
woman can suffer. All her sacrifices had been in
vain. But for Guy Horsford she might have
endured her life with Andrew Meldrum. She could
<pb n="276"/>
have done pretty much as she liked had she
chosen to humour him. But from the first she
had thwarted and irritated her husband. And it
had all come to this—she was a woman scorned,
duped, made a thing of nought to be flung aside
for a girl of mixed blood, doubtful parentage, and
belonging to a shameful calling!</p>

<p>The train for Raniganj steamed out of Calcutta
that evening, but Clare was not a passenger, and
it was whispered in the boarding-house that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Meldrum had altered her plans. She was not
going to Delhi.</p>

<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pentreath could make nothing of the puzzle
of Nara's disappearance. It looked, however,
as if Nurse Barton's theory of the manner of her
escape was well-founded. A portion of the girl's
<foreign xml:lang="hi">sari</foreign> was found on the earth immediately below
the window; no doubt it had been torn when she
let herself down. The doctor could do little more
in the matter beyond reporting it to the Calcutta
police. He was sure they would not trouble, as
there was no suspicion of foul play, and no doubt
the incident would be soon forgotten.</p>

<p>Before this period was reached, however, it was
destined to cause the doctor a little more embarrass-
ment. During the day a letter arrived from
Andrew Meldrum, enclosing a cheque for two
hundred rupees for the use of the girl when she
was discharged from the hospital.</p>

<p><q>Confound it! I don't suppose I shall ever
see her again. I can't keep this money. I'd
better return it personally and thank him. I
suppose Meldrum hasn't gone with his wife to
Delhi—or maybe she's made him miss the train.</q></p>

<pb n="277"/>
<p>The doctor went to Osmonde's hotel and asked
for Meldrum. The manager's answer was that
the merchant had set out for Madras about two
hours before.</p>

<p><q>Madras? You mean Delhi?</q> said he to the
manager.</p>

<p><q>Indeed I don't. All his luggage was labelled
Madras, and I know for a fact that he booked his
passage yesterday.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, what about <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum? She's gone
to Delhi, hasn't she?</q></p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum? I know nothing about any
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Meldrum. If <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Meldrum is married his
wife has certainly not been staying here.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh.&#x2026;</q></p>

<p>The doctor thought it discreet to ask no more
questions. He went away with a solemn shake of
the head.</p>

<head type="main">The Beginning of the End</head>

<p>A <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">dâk</foreign> palanquin was traversing the hard, white
road straight as an arrow, crossing the dry and
dusty plain to the east of Delhi, and terminating
in the bridge of boats over the Jumna. Dusk
was creeping on rapidly. The traveller had but
to shut his eyes and open them slowly to find that
the darkness of night had already gathered. The
solid walls of the King's Palace, the parapets
and towers but a few seconds before crimsoned
by the setting sun were almost lost in the universal
greyness; the grim Salim-garh Fort was a shape-
less lump of shadow.</p>

<p>The occupant of the palanquin was Guy Horsford
who, ever since he had left Cawnpore, had been
chafing at his slow progress. The runners, not
merely one party, but every party, were apparently
overcome by laziness. Nothing he could say or
do hurried them, and at last he resigned himself
to his fate.</p>

<p>He had been much longer on the journey from
Calcutta than he had anticipated. The railway
only took him a little more than a hundred miles.
Even by the iron horse the travelling was very
leisurely, but by <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="hi">dâk</foreign> along the Grand Trunk road
it was intolerable. The height of the hot season
<pb n="279"/>
was approaching, and early morning and evening
were the only times the men would work.</p>

<p>Moreover Horsford had considered it advisable
to tarry a brief space at Benares, Allahabad, and
Cawnpore to pick up news and to get some idea
of the state of feeling. The authorities at these
centres were quite sure there was no danger to be
apprehended, but they admitted to an impression
of unrest. At Cawnpore Horsford made a detour,
hired horses and rode to Lucknow, where he inter-
viewed Sir Henry Lawrence. He returned with
a conviction that the far-seeing statesman had a
profound grasp of the causes underlying the
simmering discontent, and that he by no means
shared the confidence of General Wheeler at
Cawnpore and others. The conclusion Horsford
had come to was that so well expressed by one of
the many historians of the Mutiny, who wrote that
at this time <q>the minds of the natives were
troubled; they either knew more or understood
better than the Europeans. They felt something
dreadful was at hand. Those who had money hid
it in the earth, and fear was in the hearts of all;
the jackals were heard to howl more dismally at
night; the dogs to weep round the villages; and
voices came from the jungle crying, <q><foreign xml:lang="hi">Mar, Mar</foreign></q>
(smite, smite).</q></p>

<p>It was now the second week in April, but nothing
had happened since the carrying out of Lord
Canning's order for the disbanding of the 19th,
which was done on the last day of March, and, says
the historian already quoted, <q>the sepoys returned
to their homes, spreading sedition in every station
on the way.</q></p>

<pb n="280"/>
<p>Gloom clouded Horsford's mind. He could not
put his finger on anything definite which it could be
said deepened his worries, but he was unable to get
rid of a vague sense of disquietude and impending
trouble. In one respect the foreboding he had
on leaving Calcutta had not been realised—there
were no signs of the danger against which Nara
had warned him. Latterly he had ceased to re-
gard the plot against himself as of any importance.
His thoughts were divided between Nara and
Clare and the strange workings of fate which had
brought them together. He had acted for the
best towards both, and in the face of his mission
he could hardly have done more. Pentreath, he
was sure, would look after Nara, and as for Clare,
he had made what arrangements at Raniganj he
could to secure her a safe journey the rest of the
way. It could hardly be said that outwardly the
country was unsettled or that the roads were
unsafe. He had certainly heard or seen nothing
of <foreign xml:lang="hi">dacoits</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="hi">goojurs</foreign>, the stormy petrels of troubles
ahead.</p>

<p>At last the bridge of boats was crossed; the
palanquin was through the Calcutta Gate and
was being borne towards the cantonments on the
ridge north of the city. The night was unusually
brilliant. Myriads of stars spangled the sky, and
their diffused light was safer than the direct illumi-
nation of the moon. The walls, the angles of
frowning masonry, the deep doorways cast no
inky shadows wherein assassins might lurk.</p>

<p>That strange, vague sensation of remoteness, of
ancient dynasties, habits, manners, faiths, which
Delhi, more than any other city in India, always
<pb n="281"/>
suggests, came upon Horsford directly he was
within its precincts. The narrow, tortuous lanes
between sullen walls, the noisome smells, the black,
viscid mud, were all Delhi. The palanquin crossed
one of the many courtyards of the Palace—there
was a glimpse of imposing architecture, of massive
columns, arches, ornamentation, luxuriant and
severe by turns—all Delhi. After the palanquin
emerged from the Cashmeer Gate, and Horsford's
eyes fell on the villas and the bungalows, and a
long string of oxen-drawn carts, laden with stores
for the cantonments, countless ages seemed to be
left behind. The city walls enclosed the poetry,
the mystery of antiquity; beyond were the
bustle, the actuality, the prose of modern life.</p>

<p>Horsford was not sorry to be back among his
old chums and in his old quarters, if only to enjoy
the luxury of a bed. A long and heavy sleep,
and he was ready for the difficult, the intricate
business with which he had been entrusted. He
discovered a tone of uneasiness in the talk of his
brother officers. Much discussion was indulged
in concerning the vexed question of the greased
cartridges; conjectures were hazarded as to
the meaning of the mysterious distribution of the
chupatties. Nobody had been able to discover
for what purpose these harmless flat cakes had
been passed from hand to hand. Not even the
natives seemed to know—they certainly would not
or could not give any explanation. It was as-
sumed that they were intended as a signal to be
prepared for some great event, and this in itself
was disquieting. Lastly there was Zeenut Mehal
and her intrigues. No one could say definitely
<pb n="282"/>
what they were or for what object they were
designed. All was vague and uncertain. But
the majority of the officers were optimistic. An old
Colonel, grown white in the Company's service,
declared emphatically that the English in India
would always be supreme.</p>

<p><q>And what about Delhi?</q> asked Horsford.
<q>If that goes from us everything goes.</q></p>

<p>The Colonel stared, and spluttered out:</p>

<p><q>Delhi go from us? What do you mean?
At the first hint of danger here we should at once
have assistance from Meerut and Ambala.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh possibly, but in the meantime Delhi might
be lost, and if so, with its seven miles of walls we
should want a much bigger army than we possess
to get it back. At the present moment, thanks
to our so-called conciliatory policy, we've no
English troops in Delhi, and yet we've chosen to
place there the biggest magazine in India. What
would happen in the case of a rising? All the
disaffected would flock to Delhi, and if we'd de-
sired to make things easy for them, we couldn't
have gone a better way about it.</q></p>

<p>Horsford spoke with unwonted heat, and his
violence gave great offence to some of his seniors.
They were willing to admit that Horsford had
once been well qualified to speak about Delhi, but
this was five years ago. He had been absorbed in
Burma since then, and things had changed in Delhi.
The King was old and infirm. He could not live
much longer, and the moment he was dead the
Moghul dynasty would be dead too, and Delhi would
commence a new life under British Government.</p>

<p>Horsford listened but was not convinced, and
<pb n="283"/>
soon after left, as a busy day was before him. He
had conferences with Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, the
Resident; with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Commissioner Fraser; with
Brigadier Graves. All agreed that there was no
immediate cause for alarm, and Horsford deter-
mined to see things for himself. In the dress of a
native he set out for Delhi, and purposely taking
a long detour, entered the city by the Lahore
Gate, from which the Chandi Chauk runs in
almost a straight line to the Palace. At about three-
quarters of its length from the Lahore Gate is the
road leading to the Jama Masjid, and thither he
turned his footsteps, but he did not proceed direct
to the mosque, preferring instead the maze of
noisome lanes north of the great temple of prayer.</p>

<p>He mingled with the crowd; he lingered at some
of the stalls, ostensibly to bargain but in reality
to listen to the gossip going on around, and nothing
escaped him which could in any way give the
slightest information. But so far as he could tell
the people were interested only in their own private
affairs. Then he approached the Jama Masjid.</p>

<p>About twenty yards ahead he saw a crowd
gathered in front of a placard posted on the red
sandstone walls. There was no excitement, only
quiet, profound attention. Many of the passers-by
stopped, but apparently were unable to read what
was on the placard, and asked the others. Then
one man spoke in a low voice, and the rest listened
intently. Without showing any curiosity Hors-
ford strolled to the group. The man had finished
his explanation, and those who had heard it went
on quickly. Horsford sidled his way into the crowd,
and started when he read what was on the placard.
<pb n="284"/>
It was an announcement to the effect that the
King of Persia was coming to drive the infidels
out of India!</p>

<p><q>The devil he is!</q></p>

<p>Thoughtlessly Horsford had uttered his ex-
clamation aloud and in English. One or two of
the natives within earshot turned and stared at
him. He cursed his folly, but it was too late.
At the same time it was by no means certain the
men who heard the words understood them.
The strangeness of the tongue was sufficient to
make them stare at a stranger.</p>

<p>He passed northward, back to the Chandi
Chauk, with the intention of going direct to the
Resident. It was not at all likely Sir Theophilus
Metcalfe knew of the placard which, so Horsford
found from the gossip, had only been posted that
morning. Before he reached the Chandi Chauk,
however, he discovered that he was being followed
by a tall, thin, grey-bearded man. He pretended
to take no notice, and did not even quicken his
pace. All he could do was to double upon his
shadower, and he turned into a nest of lanes in
the direction of the Palace. Thanks to dexterous
twinings and twistings, dodging among crowds,
and taking advantage of any vehicle in the road-
way to cover his movements, he at last thought
he had shaken off his pursuer, and he tried to
hark back to the broad Chandi Chauk, where he
knew he would be safe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately he was in a part of the city to
which he was an entire stranger, and the lanes
were so devious that it was impossible to tell in
what direction they ran. More than once, after
<pb n="285"/>
walking for some five minutes, he discovered himself
almost at the spot from which he had started. He
had nothing to guide him, and taking his chance,
he entered a lane more promising than the rest; so
much of it as he could see was fairly straight.</p>

<p>After walking a dozen yards or so he saw that
a little farther on the lane took a sharp turn,
almost indeed at right angles. He reached the
corner, and then saw that he was in a <foreign xml:lang="fr">cul de sac</foreign>.
Blind alleys were by no means uncommon in Delhi,
and Horsford, though disgusted, was not surprised.</p>

<p>He wheeled round. Peril, dire and unexpected,
faced him in the shape of half a dozen savage,
wiry, semi-naked men. They were armed with
sticks. Barefooted, they had followed noiselessly,
and uttering wild yells they rushed upon him
before there was time to draw his pistol, hindered
as he was by the folds of the native dress. His
fists shot out right and left, and the two foremost
went down like ninepins. The lane was narrow;
the bodies of the two prostrate men choked it.
Escape at the rear there was none. The rest of
the fellows, trusting in their numbers and in their
sticks, which it was clear to Horsford they knew
how to use, instantly surrounded him, and rained
a shower of blows upon his head and shoulders.</p>

<p>The men were skilled fencers, and though
Horsford managed to plant a crashing blow
between the eyes of the foremost, he could do
little more. As a last effort he dashed at one of
his assailants and attempted to wrest the weapon
from his grasp. He gripped the man's wrist, but
failed to hold it, for the simple reason that the
fellow had greased his arm. Before he could
<pb n="286"/>
recover himself the sticks of the others descended
with murderous force, he knew no more.</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p><q>Is he dead, Muza Khan?</q></p>

<p>The voice was of discordant, guttural shrillness,
the speaker a gross, unwieldy old woman, whose face
suggested a dried yellow skin stretched over a skull.</p>

<p><q>I—I do not think so, Sundra Bai,</q> stammered
the thin, grey-bearded man who was holding the
lamp so that its smoky light fell on the huddled
figure lying on the damp, slimy stones. Then he
knelt down, placed the lamp on the ground, and
laid his hand over the prostrate man's heart.</p>

<p><q>I can feel it throb,</q> said he at last. <q>He has
been lying here for forty-eight hours without
attention.</q></p>

<p><q>That was not my wish,</q> exclaimed the old
woman angrily. <q>Let him be seen to by the
King's physician. He must be restored to health.
I want my vengeance to be long. I would see
him die slowly—slowly: days—weeks—months—
of torture. Do you understand, Muza Khan?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, yes,</q> muttered the man. <q>Your orders
shall be obeyed, Sundra Bai.</q></p>

<p><q>See to it then. Hold the lamp nearer.</q></p>

<p>The man obeyed, and the vindictive old hag let
her glassy eyes rest on the pallid, impassive face,
streaked with blood. After a lapse of a few minutes
Sundra Bai, with a haughty gesture, made a sign
to her companion to lead the way with the lamp,
and stalked across the dungeon, her uncouth shadow
flitting on the ground, the walls, the vaulted roof
becoming more and more grotesque till the receding
light buried it in the surrounding darkness.</p>

<pb n="287"/>
<p>The King's physician came, and Horsford re-
covered consciousness, to find himself not only as
weak as a rat, but attacked with fits of shivering
and dry heat which he knew were the forerunners
of fever. His condition was not wonderful. He
was lying in one of the noisome dungeons of the
grim <choice><corr>Salim-garh</corr><orig>Salim-gahr</orig></choice> fort. His prison had a slit of a
window in the thick wall, not more than a few
feet above the river Jumna. It was the dry
season, the river was low, and its sandy bank
was the receptacle of fever-breeding refuse. The
narrow opening faced the east, and when Horsford
had thrown off the fever—a process of some three
weeks—the rising sun was the only means he had
of knowing how the days came and went.</p>

<p>What was to be his fate he could not conjecture.
Evidently he was not to be allowed to die, or why
was the physician so constant in his attentions?
But these speculations did not occupy him long.
With returning strength came one all-absorbing
desire—escape. The slit of an opening only served
to throw a pencil of light on one particular spot.
Everywhere else the floor, the roof, the walls
was black. He made his way to the door by
feeling round the walls. This door was of sturdy
timbers studded with iron. Nothing short of a
battering ram or an explosive would shatter it.</p>

<p>Horsford returned to the spot where a mat had
been thrown for his bed, by the side of which
was a lotah of water. He dragged the mat to the
patch of light, and tried to steady his thoughts
to take in the situation and its possibilities. The
dungeons of the Salim-garh, he was quite sure,
were strong enough to resist any attempt at escape.
<pb n="288"/>
If he had hammer and chisel he might perhaps
chip his way through the stone in some six months'
time, if he were permitted to work uninterruptedly.
But he had nothing. He had been thoroughly
searched, and everything, from his pistol to his
purse, taken from him.</p>

<p>Of course he would be missed by his brother
officers, but his disappearance would cause no alarm.
He was on a mission which demanded secrecy, he
had a free hand, and it might well be they would
imagine that he had good reasons for leaving Delhi.</p>

<p><q>No help from that source,</q> he muttered.</p>

<p>He could think of nothing but attacking the
men who brought him food. The plan was full
of risk; he had no weapon of any kind, and could
only trust to his fists. If he escaped their tulwars,
keen as razors, he would have to run the gauntlet
of the guard outside. Still—the boldness, the
energy, the courage of Englishmen had in India been
successful against heavy odds times out of number,
and when he was less weak he would make the
attempt.</p>

<p>That evening a change was made in his diet.
Hitherto it had been very spare, but now his
gaolers brought in a mess of savoury curry and
rice, with kabobs, as a concession to the taste of
the Englishman for meat. Convalescence had
brought with it an unbounded appetite, and he
ate the curry voraciously. Drowsiness followed as
a matter of course, and he curled himself on his
mat like a dog, and fell into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>He awoke, after how long an interval it was
impossible to say. It was night, and his prison
was in that impenetrable darkness which in itself
<pb n="289"/>
had a mysterious effect upon the nerves. He had
a sense of overpowering weight, and he at first put
down his sensations to some kind of nightmare.
He managed to move one hand slightly, and his
fingers grasped something cold and hard. In an
instant the truth flashed across his mind, and
sent his body into a clammy sweat. He was
chained to the wall. He now saw the reason of
the savoury, enticing curry. It had been drugged.</p>

<p>The discovery was appalling. He remained for
a long time numbed, overwhelmed. His plan of
escape by attacking his gaolers was foiled. Maybe
something of the kind had been anticipated. He
struggled to his feet. He could hardly move a
pace. Directly he stood upright giddiness, faint-
ness, seized him; he dropped down, a chain
clanking hideously, and fell into a kind of stupor
until daybreak. Then he heard the sounds of bolts
drawn back, of bars lifted. He did not trouble.
For the moment nothing seemed to matter.</p>

<p>Sundra Bai, the fat <soCalled>Begum,</soCalled> waddled in. She
was attended by the tall, thin, grey-bearded man,
Muza Khan. Sundra Bai was unveiled. Her eyes
were lit with hatred, with the terrible joy of ven-
geance about to be realised. Her lips, parted and
stretched, showed her betel-stained teeth, even
as they were in the days when she could smile
alluringly and tempt men to their destruction.</p>

<p>Something in her fiendish gaze roused Horsford's
dormant energy. He did not know who she was,
for he had only seen her in the gloom of the covered
cart on the fateful evening of the abduction of
Nara, but he had his suspicions. He pulled himself
together and with a violent effort raised himself
<pb n="290"/>
once more to his feet and leaned against the edge
of the embrasure sloping towards the slit of a
window. Evidently the old woman did not expect
he would show so much vigour; she drew back
hurriedly towards Muza Khan.</p>

<p><q>You need not fear, Sundra Bai,</q> said Horsford
ironically. <q>I won't hurt you.</q></p>

<p><q>No,</q> she screamed, <q>I know that. I have cut
your claws, Sahib aha!—and neither you nor any
of your accursed race can harm us. I have come to
tell what is happening. It will please you. Listen.</q></p>

<p>It was Sunday evening. The wind was from the
west and blew the sound of the chimes of the English
church towards the dungeon. The sonorous, almost
harsh clang was easily distinguishable from the sil-
very tinkle which called the faithful to the mosques.</p>

<p><q>This is the last time you will hear the bells
of your church.</q></p>

<p>Horsford shrugged his shoulders. He took her
words to mean that he had not long to live. He
understood everything now. The danger Nara
had warned him against had come to pass. The
presence of Sundra Bai explained the mystery of
the attack made upon him, of his imprisonment
in that loathsome prison.</p>

<p><q>And not you alone, Sahib Horsford,</q> she
hissed, coming very near to him now that she had
convinced herself he was powerless, <q>but all the
sahib-logues in Delhi, all the mem-sahibs, all
the babas. To-night it may be—to-morrow of a
certainty. The red and blue and white flag will
be dragged down and torn into strips and the green
flag of the true faith will be waving over Delhi.
Not one of you will be left. No—no, I am wrong
<pb n="291"/>
there—<emph>one</emph> will be spared. Do you know who that
one is? You yourself, Sahib Horsford. Your ac-
complice, Kulloo Bux, was racked with pain before
he confessed. His confession did not save him,
nor will yours save you, Sahib. His tortures were
nothing compared with what yours will be.</q></p>

<p><q>It is a matter of indifference to me what you
do,</q> broke in Horsford haughtily. <q>Englishmen
know how to die.</q></p>

<p><q>I doubt it not. Death is nothing. Bodily
agony, lasting hours—days—weeks, till you beg
and pray for mercy—that is everything. You will
have some one to see you suffer—some one you
love as your life. She shall dance and sing to you
while you slowly die. And if she refuses, there is
the lash for her. What have you to say?</q></p>

<p><q>Do as you please,</q> he rejoined doggedly. <q>I
defy you to extract a cry from me.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah yes—from <emph>you</emph>—but from your Nara?
When the whip cuts her flesh, will she be silent?
Oh, if you do not beg for mercy for yourself, you
will for her.</q></p>

<p><q>You lie, Sundra Bai. You think to terrify me.
You won't succeed.</q></p>

<p><q>We shall see. What if I bring your Nara as
proof that I speak the truth?</q></p>

<p><q>As you please. Let it be so.</q></p>

<p>Horsford spoke with the utmost <foreign xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</foreign>. He
was not going to give the venomous old hag the
slightest spark of gratification. But inwardly his
heart was torn. The deadly vengeance fore-
shadowed by Sundra Bai might, for aught he
could tell, be carried out in all its fiendish details.</p>

<p>Sundra Bai was about to throw her robe over
<pb n="292"/>
her face when the mysterious hints she had let
fall concerning the fate of the English people in
Delhi—hints which in the talk relating to himself
had dropped into the background—recurred to
him. He knew he would get no information by
asking for it direct, and he made some remark,
half sneering, half defiant, in reference to her
boasted supremacy of the green flag of Islam.</p>

<p>She turned upon him furiously.</p>

<p><q>What do you know, dog of an infidel—you
who have been shut from the world, from the light
of the sun for a month?</q></p>

<p>A month? Was it possible he had been imprisoned
in his dungeon so long? He contradicted the woman
flatly as the best way of inducing her to talk.</p>

<p><q>You are the liar,</q> she shrieked. <q>It is now
the tenth day of the fifth month. Before another
twenty-four hours are gone Delhi will be in the
hands of the Faithful and you English will be
swept away. The soldiers that you imagined
loved you so much they would defile themselves
with bullock's fat, with hog's grease to please you,
have risen against their masters at Meerut. The
sahib-logues are shot, the mem-sahibs are killed,
the soldiers are on their way to Delhi. Before long
you will hear them shouting, <q><foreign xml:lang="hi">Deen, Deen!</foreign></q></q></p>

<p>Trembling with passion, Sundra Bai flung the
end of her <foreign xml:lang="hi">sari</foreign> over her head and stalked away,
Muza Khan obsequiously following with the lamp.</p>

<p>Horsford was overwhelmed. He tried to per-
suade himself that the story was a concoction in-
tended to frighten him; yet this woman spoke
with an intensity of conviction and a confidence
which could not be gainsaid.</p>
</div>

<head type="main">The Eleventh of May</head>

<p>Sundra Bai's terrible words instead of crushing
Horsford's spirit acted upon it as a counter-
irritant and helped him to throw off the effect of
the narcotic. But with renewed enemy came also
biting suspense—gnawing anxiety and a sense of
utter helplessness. Inaction was the thing most
to be dreaded. He felt he must exert himself in
some way or he would go mad.</p>

<p>He examined his chain. It was as antiquated
as it was clumsy. The iron waistband to which
it was attached was about two inches wide by
nearly a quarter of an inch thick, hinged in front
and fastened by some kind of mechanical con-
trivance behind; so at least was his impression
after feeling it. The staple which held the chain
was solidly fixed between two stones, and for
aught he could tell had been for a century just
as it was now.</p>

<p>He stood for some minutes pondering over his
chances of freedom. They were small indeed.
The only thing upon which he could congratulate
himself was that the staple was near the window
and he was permitted to stand in the rays of the
rising sun. But this small mercy was rapidly
<pb n="294"/>
flitting. The sun was mounting, and he sadly
watched the bright patch of light depart, as one
utters farewell to a friend. Then he set to work
to try to loosen the staple.</p>

<p>For a couple of hours at least he worked the
chain, hoping to crack the cement, but without
any success. But he was not discouraged. All
that he wanted was sufficient time and patience.
Prisoners before now had done wonders with a
rusty nail. But their escape had been a matter
of months. Sundra Bai, he thought with a
shudder, would not wait long before she would
visit him again.</p>

<p><q>The hag's thirsting for her vengeance,</q> he
muttered. His hands and wrists were tired with
handling the chain, and he leaned against the
edge of the embrasure to rest himself, his eyes
fixed on the slit of daylight.</p>

<p>By standing on his toes he could catch a glimpse
of the outer world. It appeared to him he was
about six feet above the level of the Jumna.
He saw a portion of its placid waters and the
Trunk Road beyond. All was quiet—no sounds
of uproar, no firing of guns such as would be sure
to follow the uprising, the massacre hinted at by
Sundra Bai. The aspect was so peaceful that he
could not avoid coming to the conclusion that the
old woman's story was nothing but bombast in-
tended to frighten him. His thoughts went back
to his efforts to loose himself, and he had another
idea. If he could but shift the iron waistband
round so as to get the fastening in front he might
discover how to open it.</p>

<p><q>Not much chance, I guess,</q> he exclaimed
<pb n="295"/>
bitterly. <q>Hardly likely the poor devils of
prisoners, my predecessors, would not have thought
of twisting the cursed thing—only to find them-
selves foiled.</q></p>

<p>For all that he made the attempt. The band
fitted very tightly. The prisoners it had enclosed
were of smaller girth than Guy Horsford. It was
a long time before he could coax it round, and
when he had succeeded he could do nothing. It
was fastened by some kind of mechanical device
which required a key. What with his failure, his
exhaustion, and the dregs of the narcotic still
lurking about him he felt sick and faint and giddy.
He looked for his lotah of water. He could see
it, but it was beyond his reach.</p>

<p><q>The fiends!</q> he gasped.</p>

<p>Maybe this was part of the torture. He was
parched with thirst; he could see the means of
quenching it without avail. Tantalus over again.
He sank on the ground, weary and despairing.
His lips, his tongue, his throat were scorching. He
held a link of the chain within his mouth. The
coldness of the iron relieved him for a few seconds
but did no more. Weakness or the remains of the
drug brought on drowsiness. He fell into a stupor,
and when he recovered his prison was in darkness.</p>

<p>The sleep had done him good. The effects of
the narcotic were dissipated. His brain was
clearer. But the parching, the thirst, continued.
As a rule his gaolers paid their visits at nightfall
and brought food. Had they come while he was
asleep? He groped in all directions in search of
a dish, though after his last experience he felt
that nothing but starvation should induce him to
<pb n="296"/>
eat anything. His fingers encountered nothing
but the hard stone floor.</p>

<p><q>Starved to death—is that to be my fate?</q>
he cried aloud.</p>

<p>The darkness, his dismal thoughts, his help-
lessness infuriated him, and despairingly he re-
commenced working at the staple. It was a
miserable consolation seeing that his effort might
end in nothing; still it <emph>was</emph> a consolation. He
went on unceasingly and in a sort of mechanical
way, dreading to leave off. His wearied muscles
gave way only at daybreak. Then he examined
the staple. He could not see that his tugging
backwards and forwards had made the slightest
difference. The staple had been driven in so
deeply that he could get hardly any leverage. He
turned away despondently, and leaning his elbows
on the sill of the embrasure and resting his chin
on his grimy hands, he watched the rising sun.
He remained thus until the rays no longer filtered
through the slit, and only the dazzling surface of
the Jumna and the scorched plains and the frag-
ment of the white road met his eyes. Now and
again he could see people and could hear the
rumble of country carts.</p>

<p>Suddenly he perceived a moving cloud of dust
in the far distance. For several moments it was
nothing more, for the furnace-like air seemed to
be vibrating with the blaze of the sun and dis-
torted the vision. But not for long. The outline
of a couple of horsemen a little ahead of the rest
became fairly distinct. Others emerged from the
cloud but the cloud itself did not lessen. It
seemed to stretch as far as the eye could reach.</p>

<pb n="297"/>
<p><q>The devil! A stampede of cavalry!</q> cried
Horsford. <q>What in the name of Heaven is the
meaning of it?</q></p>

<p>It was simply a wild, unruly mob of horsemen.
Horsford had never seen anything so like a rout—
a <foreign xml:lang="fr">sauve qui peut</foreign> of about fifty men. He could see
but one explanation. Either they were mutineers
and were being pursued by British troops or
rebellion had broken out in Delhi and troops had
been telegraphed for to put it down. The latter
hypothesis was hardly feasible. A regiment on
duty would never forget its discipline. They would
at least ride in something like order. It was far
more likely that the party was in full flight.</p>

<p>The troopers passed, and the dust began to
subside. Then Horsford heard the confused thud,
thud of horses' hoofs. The horsemen were crossing
the bridge of boats. He listened in painful sus-
pense for the next sounds. They came, the firing
of muskets and pistols, then the voices of a huge
multitude, like the roar of an angry sea.</p>

<p>An hour went over; Horsford heard no more
firing; the voices had subsided. He hoped what-
ever was the cause of the disturbance that it had
been removed. Again he strained his eyes along
the white road. Again he saw a moving cloud
of dust, but moving so slowly that he knew the
advancing host were on foot. Soon they came
in sight, company after company in open column,
headed by a force of cavalry at a walking pace.</p>

<p><q>A rising in Delhi,</q> Horsford cried excitedly,
<q>and these men belong to a relief force. Muti-
neers would never march so steadily.</q></p>

<p>And so he was justified in thinking, for the troops
<pb n="298"/>
strode along so evenly and kept distance so well
that they might have been on the parade ground.
The head of the column passed out of sight and
then came shouts, not of anger but of joy. It
was now nothing but the tramp of feet. The last
of the force disappeared across the bridge of boats,
and Horsford tried to piece out what could have
brought this little army to Delhi, and why the ex-
isting force in the cantonments on the ridge of the
north could not have quelled any disorder within
the city walls. He could think of no adequate
explanation, and the more he thought the more
anxious he became.</p>

<p>After the troops passed into the city the cheering,
which apparently their arrival had caused, changed
into murmurs, shouts, yells—the screaming of
women. Then followed reports of firearms at
irregular intervals.</p>

<p><q>My God!</q> cried the prisoner, <q>this is mu-
tiny!</q></p>

<p>It was too true. Some few days before a test
of the new cartridge was made on the parade
ground at Meerut. The 3rd Native Cavalry,
believed to be thoroughly loyal, were told that
General Hewitt expected them to set a good
example. It was also intimated that they need
not bite the cartridges, which were not different
from those they had hitherto used, but that they
could open them with the finger. They petitioned
against the order, as they did not want to be held
in derision by the other regiments, and they also
asked that the parade might be delayed until the
excitement over the matter had calmed down.
The General refused, the parade began, and cart-
<pb n="299"/>
ridges were offered to ninety carabineers made
up of selections from each troop. Of this number
five only obeyed orders. The rest were immediately
arrested, tried by court-martial, and sentenced
to ten years' hard labour.</p>

<p>On May 9 a parade of all the troops at Meerut
was held. They were to witness the degradation
of their comrades, all men respected in the regi-
ment, all of high caste. One deep sigh burst from
the ranks when the eighty-five had been stripped
of their uniforms and the irons hammered on to
their wrists. This sigh, which seems to have been
utterly unpremeditated, and in no sense a signal,
was the only sign of emotion. The troops marched
back to quarters, and General Hewitt, who through-
out the melancholy business showed a fatuity
almost inconceivable, thought he had settled
everything satisfactorily. The next day, Sunday,
a rocket went up from the Sepoy lines. It was
the signal for a general revolt. The officers who
tried to quell the tumult were shot; the 3rd
Cavalry galloped to the gaol and released their
eighty-five comrades; fourteen hundred convicts
who were in the prison were set free, and the rest
of the troops were rapidly approaching the crisis of
rebellion. The shooting of Colonel Finnis decided
the matter. Fire, robbery, slaughter of men,
women, and children followed. Then the mutineers
set off in hot haste for Delhi. They could have
been pursued by the British troops quartered at
Meerut, but General Hewitt did nothing.</p>

<p>Suddenly Horsford heard the sound of shooting
back the bolts of his prison door. He turned at
bay. If it was his fate to be killed like a dog he
<pb n="300"/>
would die with his face to his murderers. The
next moment he recoiled in amazement. He saw
not the assassins he expected, but a girl who,
darting through his dungeon's gloom, appeared
to his fevered brain like an angel of deliverance.
He could say nothing—do nothing. He heard her
frantic whispers, but for a second or two they
seemed to convey no meaning.</p>

<p><q>They are killing all the English people!</q> she
gasped.</p>

<p>No wonder that at first he failed to realise what
she was saying. It was like the creation of some
hideous nightmare.</p>

<p><q>Come, Sahib, come. I have a safe hiding-
place for you,</q> she screamed, and seizing his arm
dragged him with all her force.</p>

<p>The girl was Nara. After Sundra Bai's frightful
threats Horsford was not surprised to see her, but
everything was overwhelmed by her terrible tidings.</p>

<p><q>Why do you not move? I—— Oh— oh—
oh!&#x2026;</q></p>

<p>The girl had caught sight of the chain of the
waistband—of the staple in the wall. She was
seized with a fit of trembling, her eyelids drooped,
she reeled and would have fallen but for Horsford
flinging his arms about her.</p>

<p>At that moment came a report which no thunder-
clap could equal. If it were possible to imagine
the crash of worlds the effect could not have been
more overwhelming. A trembling of the earth,
mysterious, rumbling noises, cracking noises, patter-
ing noises, as though the heavens were raining
missiles, swiftly followed, but of these noises the
two human beings clinging to each other were
<pb n="301"/>
unconscious. The one thought crowding out every
other was that they were waiting for death. They
were in darkness for a few seconds, and when this
disappeared and their eyes naturally sought the
light of the window the air seemed to be suffused
with a rosy mist.</p>

<p>A strange silence, in itself appalling after the
terrible sounds, followed. It seemed to be the
precursor of more horrors, as though nature had
been exhausted by her first convulsions, and was
preparing for the next effort. Words in a broken
whisper reached Horsford's ear.</p>

<p><q>Sahib—Sahib—is this—death? Oh, if—if—
with you.&#x2026;</q></p>

<p>Nara's voice died away. She crept closer within
his arms, her hands gripped one of his and she
pressed it to her lips. The mastering emotion that
he had a woman to protect seemed in some mys-
terious way to have the power of awakening
Horsford's numbed senses. He drew himself erect;
his embrace tightened; he forgot that he was
chained. He lifted her with the intention of
carrying her to the door. One pace—a sudden
jerk—a loud clanking of metal—he was free!</p>

<p>Without relinquishing his burden he turned to
where the staple had been. Between the two
stones was now a fissure about the breadth of
a finger. The cement was cracked and crumbling,
the staple had been dragged out by the jerk of his
body and was lying on the ground still attached
to the chain. There could be but one cause for
this—an earthquake.</p>

<p>The discovery brought with it a terrible dread.
The Salim-garh, stout as it was, might be the very
<pb n="302"/>
worst place for shelter. Its solidity was a danger.
Once its foundations were disturbed its own
weight would bring it down like a house of cards.
Without a word to Nara, Horsford rushed with her
to the door, his chain jangling behind him on the
hard stone. The door opened into a narrow,
vaulted passage. A glimmer of light at the end
guided him. The light came from an opening in
the wall less than a foot square and strongly
barred, and he could dimly discern a flight of
circular stone steps.</p>

<p>Standing Nara all dazed on the ground, he leaned
against the wall to get his breath, and gathered
up his chain lest it should clank. He might still
have the guard to encounter, and he asked Nara
if she could tell him where it was stationed.</p>

<p>She had seen no guard, she said. She had es-
caped from the <foreign xml:lang="hi">zenana</foreign> in the Palace, had run
across the bridge connecting the Palace with the
Salim-garh, and had easily found her way to his
dungeon. Sundra Bai had derisively told her it
was situated in the lowest and most unhealthy
part of the prison, and she had wheedled its exact
whereabouts out of the old physician who had
been called to Horsford.</p>

<p><q>Every one is away in the streets—killing,
killing,</q> she whispered fearfully. <q>Oh, it is
horrible! The soldiers at Meerut mutinied last
evening and shot their officers and the ladies and
children, and they came into Delhi this morning.</q></p>

<p>Nara also told Horsford that she had seen savage
men with drawn swords run upstairs to the apart-
ments within the Palace of Captain Douglas of the
Palace Guards, and that she had heard shouts and
<pb n="303"/>
screams. But there was no time for her to say
more than this. Horsford had got his second
wind, and he would have carried her up the circular
stairs, but she protested, and so they ran to-
gether. At the top was a small chamber with a
narrow, squat, arched door, which Horsford tried
to open, but tried in vain.</p>

<p><q>But I left it unlocked—indeed I did, Sahib,</q>
cried Nara, <q>and I took the key away. I threw
the key out of the barred window below. It was
part of my plan to set you free.</q></p>

<p>Horsford made a second attempt, but the door
opened into the room, and he had but a small
knob to grasp. He glanced at the frame and saw
a crack in the wall above. It was clear what had
happened. The earthquake had loosened some of
the stonework, and the pressure had fixed the door.
Only force on the other side could move it.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he arrived at this conclusion than
force arrived. Some one first tried to push open
the door, and then, finding it refused to budge,
threw himself against it. Still it stood fast. Then
angry words were shouted. The man was calling
to others. <q><foreign xml:lang="hi">Deen! Deen!</foreign></q> was heard in shrill
accents. The men had just come from the mas-
sacres in the streets, and were like demons. They
hurled their bodies on the door, it shook under the
onslaught.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Horsford bade Nara go down the
stairs and remain out of sight. He thought that
if he were killed the fellows would trouble to go
no further. But she refused to leave him.</p>

<p><q>If they kill you, Sahib, they may kill me too,</q>
she whispered. <q>I am not afraid.</q></p>

<pb n="304"/>
<p>Her eyes were fixed upon him with an intensity
which told him every word she said was true.</p>

<p><q>Very well,</q> he rejoined grimly. <q>Only stand
a little back. I want plenty of room for this
patent weapon of mine.</q></p>

<p>Some five feet of chain was attached to his
waistbelt, and this he had grasped so as to leave
quite two feet free. He kept his eye on the
gradually yielding door, and began swinging the
chain to get the required impetus.</p>

<p>At last! The door was swung back with a
crash. The doorway was not wide enough to
allow more than one man to enter at a time, and
the first one paid the forfeit. Down came the
chain with merciless force on his skull. He dropped
like a stone and blocked the passage-way.</p>

<p>The men behind, mad with the lust of blood,
pressed forward, but the sight of Horsford's tall,
gaunt form, his unkempt hair, his emaciated face,
and his eyes glittering with the fierce light of
desperation daunted them. The gloom of the
chamber lent a ghostly effect to the scene and
worked upon their superstitious fears. Their
nerves were in a highly electric condition. They
were as ready for abject terror as for shedding
blood. To their inflamed imagination that heroic
figure was the avenging god of the slaughtered
Englishmen and women with whose blood their
hands were red, whose bodies were not yet cold;
and Nara was the goddess urging him to vengeance!
They were doomed men if they stayed, and with
a wild yell of fright they turned and fled.</p>

<p>The man felled by the deadly chain was lying,
his body distorted, his face turned towards the
<pb n="305"/>
room, blood trickling down his dusky, ashen
cheeks from a gaping wound in the skull. Hors-
ford recognised the long, thin, withered face, the
grey hair and beard. So, too, did Nara.</p>

<p><q>Muza Khan—Muza Khan,</q> she exclaimed, in
a low, frightened voice. <q>Oh, Sahib—Sahib,
Sundra Bai will have no mercy now.</q></p>

<p>Horsford took no notice of Nara's words. He
flung himself by the side of the old man, filled
with sudden hope, and thanks to his knowledge
of native dresses he went at once to where Muza
Khan carried his money and valuables. He found
what he wanted in a receptacle beneath his girdle
—a key of strange, uncouth shape. He held it out
to Nara.</p>

<p><q>Quick—quick!</q> he shouted. <q>This ac-
cursed belt. Here's the key. Do you under-
stand?</q></p>

<p>Not another word was needed. In less than a
minute he was free from the hateful iron band.
It had not been altogether an evil. Its chain—
what would he have done without that?</p>

<p>Muza Khan was armed with a sword, and of
this Horsford took possession. He felt his muscles
stiffen as his hand grasped the hilt. If the worst
came to the worst, he would at least die fighting
like a soldier. He lifted Nara over the prostrate
dead body, and together they sped along narrow
passages, flights of steps leading where they knew
not. They had no plan of escape, all depended
on luck, and so far luck had been on their side,
and continued to be so, for they did not meet a
soul. There was no choice but to go forward,
and eventually they found themselves on the roof.</p>

<head type="main">Kismet!</head>

<p>Horsford stared about him in amazement. The
air tasted bitter. A great black cloud hung over
the city like a pall, in the distance the atmosphere
was rose-tinted. The sun was blazing furiously,
but its rays had a difficulty in penetrating the
smoke. So much had happened during the last
ten minutes that he had forgotten the terrific
report, the trembling of the ground, the vibrating
walls of the Salim-garh—the effects, so he thought,
of an earthquake.</p>

<p>As the recollection came back he looked about
for the familiar landmarks of the city. He ex-
pected to find ruin, desolation everywhere. But
the great edifices of Delhi were all intact. The
Jama Masjid was as stately, the Palace as im-
posing as ever, and he could see no change any-
where. Stay—what was that big expanse of
vacancy to the north-west, half obscured by slowly
rolling pillars of dark, dense smoke? He could
see dimly figures moving at the edges of the area
of vapour, some bending as they went, as though
searching for something, others carrying burdens
between them—burdens which he made out to be
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dhoolies</foreign>, and the truth flashed across his mind.</p>

<pb n="307"/>
<p><q>My God!</q> he cried. <q>The Magazine's
gone!</q></p>

<p>It was true. The little band of immortal
heroes, Willoughby, Scully, Buckley, Forrest, Ed-
wards, Crow, and the rest had done their work well.
They had destroyed the vast stores of ammuni-
tion, of the possession of which the mutineers
had made sure. Horsford could only gaze spell-
bound at the smoking ruins. Nara's trembling,
fragmentary words had but conveyed to him a
vague sense of horror, but now the conviction that
the long-simmering rebellion had risen to boiling-
point was forced upon him.</p>

<p>If General Hewitt, after the outbreak at Meerut,
had only shown a spark of resolution, of energy!
No doubt he thought Delhi was safe. No doubt
he believed the 54th and the 38th Sepoy regiments
stationed at Delhi would prove faithful to their
salt. He had his own safety to think of. He had
to protect himself from an attack which never
came! He had a compact body of English troops
under his command, and he cooped them up.
Delhi was left to its fate. The anxious men and
women who had fled from the massacre within
the city walls to take shelter in the Flagstaff
Tower; the officers in the cantonments who had
seen their men, so obedient but a few hours before,
jeer and scoff and rush to join the mutineers from
Meerut—looked in vain for help!</p>

<p>The roof of the Salim-garh was one big promenade
enclosed by a high parapet. There were various
openings leading to staircases, but before descending
one of these Horsford reconnoitred his surround-
ings. He held out his hand to Nara, she clung to
<pb n="308"/>
it gratefully, and together they hastened to the
eastern side overlooking the Jumna. One glance
was enough. The Grand Trunk Road was strongly
held, the bridge of boats had been secured, and
troops patrolled the river bank.</p>

<p><q>Look—look!</q> suddenly cried the girl. <q>Those
two poor men. They are running to the river—
they are being pursued—they are swimming.
Ah, they have escaped, and—oh, cruel—cruel!</q></p>

<p>She covered her eyes with her <foreign xml:lang="hi">sari</foreign> to shut out
the sight. Horsford set his teeth and clenched
his hands. The men had come from the city
chased by a couple of troopers. The horses' hoofs
sank in the soft sand, and the fugitives reached
the river. But it was of no avail. The soldiers
on the bank raised their muskets, levelled and
deliberately shot the two swimmers.</p>

<p>Horsford had hoped to escape by the river.
The incident told him that such an attempt—at
all events by daylight—would mean death. He
ran with Nara across to the other side of the Fort
facing the city. Their ears were filled with a
horrid din—shouts, yells, the screams of women,
the hoarse voices of savage men, the crashing of
wood, as of heavy hammers descending on doors
and window shutters, the splintering of glass,
the sharp report of muskets, and underneath all—
a sort of ground bass, as it were—a continual growl,
now rising to an angry roar, now sinking to sullen
murmurs. All the narrow lanes within view were
packed with seething crowds, struggling, fighting,
swaying, with now and again mad rushes to some
point where doubtless there was plunder. The
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign>, the riffraff of vile slums such as it is
<pb n="309"/>
impossible to picture had been let loose. Delhi
had emptied its sinks of iniquity. Robbery and
murder went on everywhere, and no one cared.
And it was for this the soldiers had thrown off
the allegiance of years, and had turned against
those whom they loved and respected!</p>

<p><q>It's pretty bad for me,</q> murmured Horsford,
<q>but for you, my poor child—my God! it's
frightful. Well, we must do something,</q> he went
on desperately. <q>We can't stay here. We're
bound to be discovered, and we shall be like rabbits
in the open without a vestige of shelter. Look
here, Nara, you must leave me——</q></p>

<p><q>No, I will <emph>not,</emph></q> she burst out passionately.</p>

<p><q>Wait a moment. Just listen. You're of your
mother's race now. You must forget your English
blood. No one will harm you by yourself—you
belong to India. But if you're with me—it will
mean death. You must go back and——</q></p>

<p><q>No,</q> she interrupted, not now with passion, but
with the calm, subdued tone of unshaken resolve.
<q>I'm not afraid to die—with you, Sahib. What
have I to live for? You are my only friend.
I've no love for any one but you.</q></p>

<p>Her large, lustrous eyes were upturned to his.
There was no fear, no doubt in their fathomless
depths. Horsford's heart, and he did not check it,
went out to hers. Yet his feeling was not that of
love as love is understood in this world. It was
something purer—something higher—some would
call it the co-mingling of souls, and so it may have
been; but what both were conscious of was
sacrifice for each other, and in this intensity of
emotion, in the supreme moment when death and
<pb n="310"/>
life are face to face, there is consolation, courage,
an exquisite pleasure.</p>

<p><q>You shall have your own way, little Nara.
I won't let you go from me.</q></p>

<p>It was not a time for words, but if words had to
be uttered, he could have said nothing better than
this. Tears of joy trembled on her dark lashes,
and for an instant they stood silent, their hands
clasped, faith in each other shining in their eyes.</p>

<p><q>So,</q> he cried, in a tone of fierce gaiety,
<q>we're to be comrades. Good. Then you must
help me. Tell me what was in your mind when
you burst into my prison. You had some plan,
eh?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes—yes. I know of a secret passage from
the Palace to an underground place outside.</q></p>

<p><q>That sounds well. And have you found a
secret passage to the Palace too without crossing
the bridge?</q></p>

<p>His tone of raillery pained her. She was des-
perately in earnest, and so indeed was he, but he
had his own way of showing it.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> she cried, <q>there's no other way but by
the bridge. Oh, Sahib—Sahib, you don't believe
me. You're laughing at me. It is not kind.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't trouble, little one. We'll go to that
hiding-place of yours, and we'll cross the bridge
—if we get there alive,</q> he added to himself.</p>

<p>He chose the nearest exit, an opening which led
to a circular staircase exactly like that which he
and Nara had ascended. They met no one.
They heard no sounds. The fort was deserted.
The prisoners had been released and had gone on
with the gaolers to join the looters.</p>

<pb n="311"/>
<p>The bridge was originally constructed as a
private and direct communication between the
Palace and the Salim-garh. After the British
possessed Delhi the King was debarred from using
this passage-way, but the prohibition was, years
after, withdrawn. Otherwise Horsford could hardly
have been taken secretly to the prison.</p>

<p>The fugitives reached the bridge. Then Hors-
ford hesitated. He could see armed men at the
Palace windows. It might be safer to wait until
dusk. There was no danger in staying where they
were. Neither gaolers nor prisoners glutted with
spoil were likely to return to the grim Salim-garh.
They would be certain to go to quarters of the
city more to their liking and where they could be
easily relieved of their ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p>So the two remained in the deep shadow of the
doorway overlooking the bridge and talked in low
tones. Nara had much to tell. She had escaped
from the hospital exactly as Nurse Barton had
supposed—dropping from the window-sill to the
soft sand beneath. Then she hastened to the shop
in the bazaar where she had overheard the con-
versation between Sundra Bai and Muza Khan,
and she discovered that Sundra Bai was lodging
in the house. She disclosed herself to the old
woman and made out that she was sick of being
ayah to a mem-sahib and that she wanted to go
back to the <foreign xml:lang="hi">tuwaif's</foreign> life.</p>

<p><q>You told the old hag <emph>that</emph>! My God! how
could you!</q></p>

<p><q>I had to. There was no other way. I heard
at the hospital that you had gone to Delhi. Sun-
dra Bai wanted to know what I had been doing
<pb n="312"/>
since I went from her. I told her lies. I would
not say a word about you, Sahib. I said I did
not know your name. I said I hated the English.
You will forgive me, Sahib, won't you?</q></p>

<p><q>I've nothing to forgive, Nara, excepting your
foolishness in following me. You should have
stayed with <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pentreath. I asked him to tell
you.</q></p>

<p><q>I know, but God willed it should be otherwise.
He was right—was it not so? Sundra Bai has
no dancing-girls now,</q> she went on rapidly, <q>she
is in Zeenut Mehal's service. She knows all about
cosmetics, painting the face, washes, perfumes—
poisons. Zeenut Mehal and the ladies of the
<foreign xml:lang="hi">zenana</foreign> are always making her handsome presents.
She has rich jewels; and she put them on just
before I ran to your prison. She told me she
meant to jeer at you with all her grandeur while
you were lying helpless. Everything was ready
for the torture—the wretches with knives, men
with the burning charcoal and the irons. Oh,
I can't bear to think of it! But God would not
permit such wickedness. When Sundra Bai was
about to start with the others the soldiers from
Meerut rushed into the Palace, yelling like demons
and waving their swords. I slipped away un-
noticed.</q></p>

<p><q>You've been very good and you've been
lucky,</q> said he, kissing her forehead. <q>And now
we'll try our luck again.</q></p>

<p>The daylight was gone and hand in hand they
crossed the bridge. Everything in Delhi that day
had been left to chance. Wild lawlessness, up-
roar, robbery, murder, reigned supreme. The
<pb n="313"/>
Palace gate at the bridge had been opened to admit
the handful of troopers who arrived with the news
from Meerut and had not been shut. The two
stole within the portals. They could hear the
hum of voices at a distance; otherwise the Palace
was as silent as the Salim-garh.</p>

<p>Nara was now the guide. She led Horsford into
a courtyard and thence into one of the arcades it
enclosed.</p>

<p><q>We pass under the archway in the corner,</q>
she whispered. <q>The stairs inside go to the
<foreign xml:lang="hi">zenana</foreign>. Some of the panels of the wall opposite
the staircase are really doors. I found that out
when I was watching Sundra Bai. I saw her
slide one of the panels back and disappear. That
made me try the next. I found my way to the
hiding-place I told you of, and——</q></p>

<p>The girl stopped, recoiled, and pointed her
finger.</p>

<p><q>Look—look—there—on the ground!</q> she
gasped.</p>

<p>The feeble light of the stars was sufficient to
show a shapeless mass like a huge bundle. Hors-
ford went nearer and the bundle resolved itself
into a woman, her <foreign xml:lang="hi">sari</foreign> torn and tangled, the arms
stretched out at right angles to the body. Dark
patches of moisture near the head, the extremities
of the arms, the feet, were of sinister significance.
One glance at the unwieldy figure, at the face,
was enough. It was Sundra Bai—dead, murdered
for the sake of her jewels! The miscreants could
not wait to drag her gold bangles over her hands
and feet, and the rings from her fingers and toes;
their sharp knives had found a quicker way.</p>

<pb n="314"/>
<p>The dead woman was lying near the sliding door
of which Nara had spoken. The door was open
and Horsford saw on a little bracket close to the
doorway a lamp and a box of English matches.
He annexed both. He struck a match. Its glare
showed a regiment of quaint jars, flasks, gallipots,
alembics, pots and pans. A charcoal stove stood
in a recess. The air was charged with the smell
of drugs and concoctions of herbs. The very
sickliness of the atmosphere suggested death.
Doubtless it was here that Sundra Bai prepared
her nostrums. Horsford hurried back to Nara
and told her of his discovery.</p>

<p><q>It is just,</q> said the shuddering girl. <q>God
has punished her for her wickedness.</q></p>

<p>It was some time before Nara controlled her
trembling fingers sufficiently to manipulate the
spring of the other door; then Horsford pushed
the panel back and they entered. He lit the lamp,
closed the panel, slid his arm within Nara's and
the two hastened between the stone walls of a
tortuous passage. They followed its twinings and
twistings and emerged into a series of small
vaulted cellars. Horsford was not surprised.
Many of the Delhi houses were provided with
similar tyekhanas. A broad step-ladder against
the wall of the furthermost cellar led to a trap-
door, which Horsford forced open. The din of
tumult, the mingling of countless horrid sounds,
which had been inaudible while he was under-
ground, broke upon his ear.</p>

<p>He found himself in a room which it was clear
had been visited by looters, who, out of mere
wantonness, had smashed what was not portable
<pb n="315"/>
or not worth stealing. Through the windows—
small openings near the ceiling—came a red glare,
and now and again clouds of suffocating, nauseous
smoke. Incendiaries were at work outside.</p>

<p>The house was in the Chandi Chauk. Every
room had been pillaged and dismantled and the oc-
cupants had left the dwelling to its fate. Horsford
and Nara ascended to the roof and from behind
the parapet surveyed the terrible scene. Tongues
of flame broke the darkness in every direction, the
streets, the lanes were filled with a wild, surging
mob.</p>

<p>There is no need to tell again the story of the
massacre of that horrible first day. It has been
described oftentimes. Horsford feared the worst
but he could not realise the horror. Two things,
however, were very clear to him—firstly, the city
was in the hands of the mutineers, and secondly,
the little British force in the cantonments was
helpless. To regain Delhi meant the employment
of a properly equipped army. And there were
so few British troops in India at that moment,
alas!</p>

<p>Their own fate—his and Nara's—what would
that be? A house which had been looted no
longer presented temptation, and they might stay
there and be safe, but to what end? Starvation
was certain. Before day broke the lust for blood
and plunder would probably be sated, and in their
native dresses they might steal along in the shadow
of the houses to the Lahore Gate. Of course the
Cashmeer Gate was the nearest to the canton-
ments, but here was the centre of violence. If,
as he was quite sure was the case, the 38th and
<pb n="316"/>
the 54th had mutinied no one would be allowed
to pass out of the Cashmeer Gate. But the Lahore
Gate at the extreme west might not be guarded in
the present state of anarchy.</p>

<p>Three hours went by. Where there had been
flames were now patches of sullen red. A hoarse
murmur, rising now and again to mocking laughter,
had succeeded savage yells and frenzied shrieks.
After daylight the fell work of butchery would
probably recommence.</p>

<p><q>We're going to try to escape, little Nara,</q>
said Horsford quietly.</p>

<p><q>Yes, Sahib.</q></p>

<p>This was all they said. They descended to the
ground floor. The marauders had entered the
house from a lane in the rear and had not troubled
to close any doors. The lane curved towards the
Chandi Chauk and within five minutes the two
were hastening towards the Lahore Gate. Hors-
ford was careful to keep the girl between himself
and the houses. There were many gruesome
sights in the roadway.</p>

<p>The street was full of ruffianly stragglers, but
the fugitives looked too poor and wretched to be
worth molesting. The Lahore Gate was quite
deserted. Had an avenging force been in readiness
it could have entered the city without the slightest
opposition.</p>

<p>Soon they were in the open country and work-
ing their way north towards the cantonments.
Horsford knew every inch of the ground. Many
a time in the old days had he marched at the
head of his company along that road which he
was now traversing, possibly to encounter as
<pb n="317"/>
enemies some of the very soldiers who once
obeyed instantly his slightest word of command.</p>

<p>They passed many bungalows, each in its own
compound; another mile or so would bring them
in sight of the Flagstaff Tower. There were no
mutineers or <foreign xml:lang="hi">goojurs</foreign> to be seen. The looters had
not yet finished their work of despoiling the city,
but in a few hours this would be over and they
would be let loose, with their brutal appetites
whetted for more pillage and blood. But danger
might come from another source. The news of
the mutiny and of the seizure of Delhi had spread
far and wide; swarms of <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign> from the
surrounding villages had set out to share in the
spoil and these had been joined by later mutineers
from Meerut.</p>

<p>Soon after passing the junction of the road to
the cantonments with the Karnal road, Nara
became so exhausted she was on the verge of
fainting. She confessed to having eaten nothing
for the last twenty-four hours. The pale light of
dawn showed a bungalow close by and Horsford
determined to enter it. Most likely the occupants
had fled to the cantonments, but something might
be left behind in the way of food.</p>

<p>From the size of the compound and the rare
plants and flowers it contained the bungalow was
evidently the residence of a wealthy man. The
bungalow itself was large and solid. In spite of
her protests Horsford carried the girl to the veran-
dah and sat her down while he examined the doors
and windows. One of the windows was not only
unfastened but open. He entered a drawing-
room sumptuously furnished in the European
<pb n="318"/>
fashion. He brought the girl into the room and
laid her on the couch. Then he latched the window
and set out to explore the other portions of the
bungalow, especially the kitchen and the larder.
Everybody was gone, and the place was in con-
fusion. He found some portions of chicken and
rice and brought them to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Nara had risen from the couch and was staring
at a picture on the wall. Horsford's eyes went to
it too. It was a portrait of Clare! Clare in all
her fresh beauty of five years ago, a beauty which
had lost nothing in the hands of the artist! Mel-
drum had had it painted in London during the
honeymoon.</p>

<p><q>Sahib, I told you I was maid to a lady who
brought me back to India. That is she. Is it
not strange? I know it's the same lady because
Clare Meldrum is written on some music on the
piano.</q></p>

<p>Fate had led them to Andrew Meldrum's bunga-
low as their last refuge! And fate mercifully was
moving with rapid strides. A hideous noise from
without burst upon their ears. The doomed man
seized the sword he had taken from Muza Khan,
and turned to Nara who, her hands clasped to her
breast, seemed to be patiently awaiting him.
Instantly his arms were round her and their lips
met in the last embrace. The girl knew, as he did,
that the end had come; but before her boundless
love Death lost its terrors.</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p><q>One of the most tragic mementoes of the
terrible Delhi massacre has just been made public,</q>
<pb n="319"/>
wrote the Calcutta correspondent of <title>Galignani's
Messenger</title> six months later, when Delhi had been
recaptured, and little was talked about but the
heroic exploit of Home, Salkeld, Burgess, Car-
michael, and Smith, and the death of the gallant
Nicholson. <q>About a week after the rebels had
taken possession of the city a detachment of
British soldiers was instructed to occupy a bunga-
low, which from its elevated position commanded
the road between the Lahore and Cashmeer Gates.
On entering one of the rooms they found the dead
body of an Englishman and a native girl. The
Englishman was easily recognised by the officer
in command as Colonel Horsford, who was in
Delhi on a secret mission at the time of the out-
break. There was ample evidence that Colonel
Horsford had sold his life and that of his companion
dearly. His sword had snapped, his fingers were
still grasping the hilt; the blade was lying several
feet away. The bodies of dead sepoys told their
own tale. Round the girl's neck was a thin, gold
chain, to which a locket containing a miniature
portrait of an English officer was attached. It is
said that the girl on the mother's side was descended
from the royal family of Delhi.</q></p>

<p>A handsome woman, richly attired, had her
eyes fixed on this paragraph, her lips pressed
together until they were almost bloodless. There
came a tap at the door and, startled, she flung the
paper behind the couch. A servant entered and
announced the expected visitor, the Duc de Valen-
çon, a man of distinguished appearance who ap-
proached the lady with an indefinable air of
possession. He took the white jewelled hand
<pb n="320"/>
extended to him and raised it to his lips with a
murmured: <q>You are charming, Madame.</q></p>

<p>Madame smiled coldly, accepted his proffered
arm, and the two descended the staircase to the
carriage and pair in waiting. They were set
down at the Tuileries. The Empress Eugenie was
giving one of the splendid balls identified with
the Second Empire.</p>

<p>In the adulatory notice of the function which
appeared in the <title>Moniteur</title> the following morning
a whole paragraph was devoted to a description of
the dress and jewels of <q><foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">La belle Anglaise</foreign>.</q> In
these pages she is known better as Clare Meldrum.</p>
