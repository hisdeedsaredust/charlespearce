<head type="main">Introduction</head>

<p>Cawnpore occupies <choice><reg>a</reg><orig>an</orig></choice> unique position in the
history of the Indian Mutiny. It supplies the only
instance where personal hatred and personal re-
venge actuated the instigators of the tragedy. It
presents the solitary example of a definite plan of
procedure arranged by recognised leaders. The
outbreaks at Meerut, at Delhi, at Lucknow, and
other places, were without purpose or policy. At
Cawnpore all was coldly and carefully thought out
beforehand. Whether the final horror was contem-
plated may be doubted, but when it was decided
upon, it was carried out with fiendish determination
and completeness. Nana Sahib, and his lieutenant
Azimoolah Khan, found a ready and willing instru-
ment at hand in a woman, and the official inquiry
subsequently held showed beyond question that to
Hooseinee Khanum, the servant of the Nana's
favourite dancing-girl, belongs the infamy of the
House of Massacre.</p>

<p>It may seem to some that the story of Cawnpore
is one too painful to revive, and if the remembrance
meant the horrors alone I should be disposed to
agree. But Cawnpore signifies far more than a
mere recital of horrors. It stands for all that is
noble, heroic, and enduring in the men and women
of Great Britain; and as a monumental example
of dauntless courage, devotion, and self-sacrifice it
cannot be excelled in the world's history.</p>

<p><q>Red Revenge</q> is an attempt to picture the
progress of events in Cawnpore leading up to the
occupation of Sir Hugh Wheeler's ill-fated en-
trenchment, and its terrible sequel. I have not
sought to heighten the effect by dwelling on the
feeling of detestation with which, during the Mutiny,
<pb n="8"/>
the sepoys were regarded in England. The excep-
tional ferocity exhibited at Cawnpore was at the
moment held to be evidence of innate savagery
and lust for blood, justifying the repulsive reprisals
of Neill. Time has modified this view. It is a
question whether the cause of that ferocity is not to
be attributed to some form of dementia, such as
found its outlet in France under the Reign of Terror.
Throughout the Mutiny the contagion of the mania
for bloodshed, and the highly strung condition of
those who were drawn within the influence of that
mania, were especially noticeable. The nerves of
the East Indian are not to be judged by those of the
Anglo-Saxon. The Mutiny was started by one man,
Mungul Pandy, who ran amok; the subsequent
breaking away of regiments of <soCalled>Pandies</soCalled> was
but a process of the same kind. In a great measure
this was the case at Cawnpore, but with a difference.
The Nana and Azimoolah knew how to take advant-
age of the weakness of their countrymen, and they
utilised it for their own merciless schemes. Herein
lies the dramatic element in the story of Cawnpore.</p>

<p>The intertwining of fiction with fact is generally
attended by the subordination of one to the other.
Contrary to the usual rule, I have thought it ad-
visable to give the leading place to fact. In the
case of Cawnpore it was difficult to do otherwise.
The bare narrative is so full of detail, so exciting
in its various situations, so swift in its action, and
its catastrophe so colossal, that it naturally over-
shadows individual interests. Of a necessity,
Mowbray Thomson, Shepherd, and Trevelyan have
been largely drawn upon in so far as the occupation
of the entrenchment and its siege are concerned;
what happened after the destruction of the boats,
and the return of the doomed women to Cawnpore,
is derived from the evidence of natives given at the
official inquiry.</p>

<head type="main">After a <soCalled>Heavy</soCalled> Night with the Nana</head>

<p>A lamp was burning dimly in the sitting-room
of the bungalow. The smoky light did little
more than show indistinctly the outlines of the
bare, clumsy table in the centre, the half-dozen
chairs, all of different shapes and more or less
rickety, an ugly, comfortless couch, a long cane
chair of native manufacture, and a nondescript
cabinet or cupboard, some three feet high, on
the top of which were tumblers, a bottle of
brandy, and sundry bottles of pale ale.</p>

<p>Pictures cut from the <title>Illustrated London News</title>
decorated the walls, and in the place of honour
over the spindle-legged writing-table at the side
hung a framed water-colour portrait of a lady,
whose hair in side curls, dominated by a high
comb at the back, and whose dress with its
leg-of-mutton sleeves and broad lace collar
unmistakably denoted the very early Victorian
fashions. On the spindle-legged table were
newspapers by the last post from England, a
few books, writing materials, and a bundle of
<pb n="10"/>
official-looking documents. A rifle and pig-
sticking spear were in the angle formed by the
table and the wall.</p>

<p>The night was not a time of continuous silence
—it hardly ever is in India. The irritating
whirr of innumerable insects, the hoarse barks
of distant pariah dogs, strange sounds of
laughter from a group of grass-cutters squatting
round a fire cooking chupatties, or wheaten
cakes, were only a few of the noises that broke
the stillness.</p>

<p>Then came a sound much more pronounced
and definite—the tramp of horses' feet. The
sahib of the bungalow attended by his servant
had come home. The sahib, Lieutenant Dick
Heron, swung his leg over the saddle and
dropped to the ground, not with his usual
springy alertness, but with the air of a man
who was dead beat. He stood for a few seconds
motionless, his arm resting on his horse's neck,
then straightening himself he mumbled an order
in Hindustani to the sleek, dark-skinned soldier
behind him, and walked with a somewhat
unsteady gait towards the bungalow, dazzlingly
white in the cold moon rays.</p>

<p><q>In for a <q>head</q> to-morrow, by Jove,</q> he
groaned, a little shiver, the foretaste of trial
and tribulation, passing over him. <q>I'm not
seasoned to this kind of fun yet, like the Major,
Captain Cardross, Walker, Kendrick, and the
rest, and I don't know that I want to be seasoned.
It means a leather liver, I guess. Anyhow, if
you've got to see life, see it and forget the
business as soon as possible.</q></p>

<pb n="11"/>
<p>Lieutenant Heron was in a penitent mood—
not an uncommon sequitur to a <soCalled>heavy</soCalled> night;
and the function at the Nana's palace at Bithoor
had been unusually heavy. He advanced in a
somewhat zigzag fashion towards the bungalow.</p>

<p>Dick Heron, slim, pallid—a little more so than
usual, thanks to the Nana's champagne, brandy,
and full-flavoured cheroots—was very much in
looks what ladies nowadays would call <soCalled>a nice
boy.</soCalled> He had come straight from Addiscombe
to India, and before he had been six months in
the country influence bestowed a lieutenancy
upon him. He was gaining a little experience
of native ways and customs under the guidance
of Seereek Dhoondoo Punth, better known as
Nana Sahib, whose professions of friendship for
the English officers at the Cawnpore station
were never-ending. Outside the Nana's profuse
hospitality and his own regimental duties Dick
Heron knew very little. At present he saw
everything through the spectacles of Anglo-
Indian routine and tradition, and if he thought
of anything at all it was that he was having a
good time. He had, in fact, like all <soCalled>griffins,</soCalled>
—as newly arrived unfledged English officers
were then called—<soCalled>gone the pace.</soCalled></p>

<p>Dick stumbled up the steps leading to the
verandah which ran round three sides of the
squat one-storeyed building, and in the doorway
leading to his rooms fell over an inanimate
huddled-up object, at which he did his best to
swear in Hindustani. The effort, however, was
too great, and he relapsed into English. The
object, his <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">chokadar</foreign> or watchman, grovelled at
<pb n="12"/>
the Sahib's feet in Eastern fashion, mumbled
abject apologies to <q>my lord,</q> and crawled
away to sleep in a less inconvenient place than a
passage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile <q>his lordship</q> stumbled into the
sitting-room. The light had attracted myriads
of winged creatures; the air was like a hot blast.
It was the dry season, and everyone was praying
for the speedy arrival of the monsoon. Two
white bundles, disturbed by the Sahib's noisy
entrance, unfolded themselves into human beings.
One glided hurriedly to his place at the punkah
to escape his lordship's wrath, and began working
the clumsy apparatus vigorously. The other,
with many salaams, busied himself in assisting
the Sahib to undress.</p>

<p>A door on the right opened into the bedroom.
In the middle of the room was a bedstead, its
legs standing in pans of water to check the
invasion of undesirable creeping things, the
upper part enclosed by mosquito curtains. On
the mattress was a rush mat, pillow, and light
coverlet. Dick Heron was too drowsy and
fatigued to do much more than growl at his
servant; and, clad in shirt and pyjamas of
Delhi silk, he threw himself helplessly on his
bed and dropped almost immediately into a
heavy sleep to the accompaniment of the creak-
ing punkah.</p>

<p>He had been dead to the world but five
minutes when he awoke, bathed in perspiration,
gasping for breath, his mouth and throat dry as
the parched earth outside. He thought he had
been asleep five hours. The brilliant moonrays
<pb n="13"/>
stealing into the room through the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khuss tatties</foreign>,
or grass mats at the windows, he mistook for
the break of day. He expected every moment
to hear the hated sound of gunfire announcing
that another day of monotony had begun, and
reminding him that in half an hour he must
present himself on the parade ground.</p>

<p>He lay quietly for a couple of minutes trying
to endure his splitting headache, and inwardly
cursing his bearer for not bringing him the
customary cup of tea, when he became conscious
of two things, firstly, that the silvery light which
cast such inky shadows could hardly indicate
the misty yellow dawn, and secondly, that the
punkah was motionless. No wonder the close,
heavy air was insufferable.</p>

<p>In a burst of irritation he started up, seized his
slippers (kept on the bed to prevent appropria-
tion by giant ants or maybe a snake), thrust in
his feet, switched back the mosquito curtains,
and flung at the punkah-wallah his stock of
opprobrious Hindustani epithets, finishing by
hurling a boot in the direction of the slumberer.
The admonition was effectual. The punkah re-
sumed its creaking and swinging, but in a fashion
too energetic to last; Dick filled a tumbler with
water from a porous earthenware pitcher, hoping
to cool his burning throat.</p>

<p><q>Pooh—beastly tepid stuff,</q> he growled, and
once more rolled on to his bed.</p>

<p>Sleep was impossible. He tossed from side
to side. His brain was simmering. A dozen
grotesque pictures chased each other across the
retina struggling for mastery. Gorgeous colours,
<pb n="14"/>
brilliant lights, the flash of jewels were mingled
in chaotic confusion; a subtle perfume, sweet,
yet pungent, haunted him, and with it came
the vision of a woman with the smile of a Delilah
in her eyes of midnight, her lips parted allur-
ingly; her small even teeth crimson with betel
nut. She was waving her long, round, snake-like
arms with slow, graceful motions; every muscle
of her sinuous body appeared to keep time with
the monotonous tap-tap, the drone, and the soft
twanging of native instruments. Each move-
ment, each gesture of the slim serpentine form
had its meaning—and the meaning lingered in
the senses of the lad. Adala, the dancing-girl,
whose slightest whim was law at the Palace of
Bithoor, had much to do with spoiling the rest
of the young subaltern, fresh to the fascination,
the mystery of India, and the practised, insidious
arts of her women.</p>

<p>Another figure hovered in the background of
Dick Heron's mental picture—a man, gross and
unwieldy in form; his face sallow, sleek, inane,
slightly pock-marked; his eyes expressionless and
singularly set, suggesting those of a puppet; his
clean shaven chin and head denoting the Mah-
ratta. This was Seereek Dhoondoo Punth, Nana
Sahib, the adopted son of the dead Bajee Rao,
the Peishwa of Poonah, and the last monarch of
the Mahratta dynasty in Central India, deposed
by us in the forties and exiled to his palace at
Bithoor to live luxuriously on the eighty thou-
sand a year assigned to him. Round and round
within Dick's fevered brain went this picture,
like a squirrel in a cage, gradually becoming
<pb n="15"/>
dimmer until he dropped into unconsciousness
out of sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>He was aroused by his <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign> with tea,
and his head splitting fit to burst, he struggled
back into life, the repulsive duty of the morning
inspection on the hot, dusty parade-ground
uppermost in his mind. He staggered sleepily
into his bath-room, a little low-walled enclosure,
paved with rough brick; a jar of cold water
dashed over his seething body somewhat restored
him; he struggled into his regimentals with the
assistance of his servant, and managed to put
in an appearance on the parade ground in time
to escape a wigging from the colonel.</p>

<p>Then came the inspection of arms and accoutre-
ments—a part of his daily duty he had grown to
loathe. He hated the long rows of dusky faces
more than ever this morning. He thought the
sepoys looked very ridiculous in their ill-cut,
ill-fitting, English uniforms. Perhaps the sepoys
thought so too, for every morning directly they
were dismissed, they rushed to their huts, dis-
carded the incongruous garments, and put on
their native dress.</p>

<p>Dick Heron was in a bad temper, and to his
disturbed vision everything seemed out of gear.
He grumbled at his men, his irritation increased
by a kind of supercilious insolence which he
fancied he noticed in their demeanour. He
wound up by nagging at the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">havildar</foreign>, or native
sergeant, before his men, and with the perversity
and arrogance of youth went on heedless of the
flash of anger that leaped to the man's eyes and
was reflected in those of the rank and file.</p>

<pb n="16"/>
<p>At last, somewhere about eight o'clock the
welcome signal for dismissal was heard, and Dick
strolled bark to his bungalow for breakfast, a
second toilet, and an hour's study of the language
of the natives with his teacher. To be able to
write the letters <q>P.H.,</q> passed in Hindustani,
after his name was a stepping-stone to pro-
motion. About noon he sauntered into the
breakfast club for a chat with his comrades, and
possibly to linger over tiffin if he could summon
sufficient appetite.</p>

<p>Half a dozen men were lolling in bamboo chairs
in the verandah, smoking and sipping the in-
evitable brandy pawnee. They greeted Dick
Heron with grins and uproarious applause. He
looked at them in amazement, and drew himself
up a little stiffly. One young fellow, Captain
Howard Kendrick, whom Dick had known at
Addiscombe, rose and with an air of mock defer-
ence pointed to the chair he had just vacated.</p>

<p><said>Don't be an ass, Kendrick,</said> growled Dick.
<said>Perhaps you'll kindly explain why you're
all bent upon making yourselves idiots this
morning.</said></p>

<p><said>My dear fellow, we're only desirous of
showing our sense of your superiority,</said> said
Kendrick, bowing and waving his hand towards
the empty chair.</p>

<p><said>Superiority in what—common sense?</said></p>

<p><said>Anything but that, dear boy—anything but
that! What do you say, gentlemen?</said></p>

<p>A roar of laughter was the response. Dick
was angrier than ever.</p>

<p><said>Set of jays,</said> he muttered, under his breath.</p>

<pb n="17"/>

<p>Kendrick was distinguished at Addiscombe
for his cool impudence and his fertile imagina-
tion. Just now he was bent upon displaying
both.</p>

<p><said>We want to compliment you, old chap, on
your conquest. By Jove, I've seen nothing like
it since I've been stationed here, and I've had
a year's experience of this detestable spot. Your
love-making was superb.</said></p>

<p><said>My love-making?</said> faltered Dick.</p>

<p>Howard Kendrick nodded gravely. The
others, taking their cue from the imaginative
young captain, nodded in much the same fashion.
Dick Heron was beginning to feel goaded beyond
endurance.</p>

<p><said>What Kendrick wants to tell you—only he's
such a confounded long time about it—is that
you went at a devil of a pace last night at the
Nana's dinner-party and——</said></p>

<p><said>Please don't interrupt, Dalrymple,</said> said
Kendrick loftily. <said>I've sat on too many court-
martials not to know how to conduct an in-
quiry. Don't you recollect, Dick, how when that
dusky witch Adala made eyes at you and finished
up her fetching performance by kneeling at your
feet, that you insisted upon her sitting by your
side? By Gad, and she did it, too, and in a
jiffy your arm went round her waist. You
should have seen the Nana's codfish eyes flare
up. It was a risky thing to do. The Mahara-
jah's spent a fortune on his pet dancing-girl.
Those heavy bangles on the artful jade's arms
are worth more than a sub's pay for a twelve-
month.</said></p>

<pb n="18"/>

<p><said>I don't remember anything of the kind,</said>
stammered Dick. <said>I couldn't have been such
a fool.</said></p>

<p><said>Why not? Those girls can twist any man
they want round their fingers. They've been at
the game for hundreds of years. The women of
Paris can't teach them anything they don't
know in that way. I only hope you haven't
made the Nana jealous. Not that it would
matter very much—he's too lazy and good-
natured to bother about such a trifle. Besides,
he's awfully fond of the English. Look at the
presents some of our fellows have had from him,
and I dare say if you cut him out he won't mind
very much. He's only to send to Cashmere
and get half a dozen girls as handsome as Adala,
though not, I grant you, so bewitching.</said></p>

<p><said>Stop your silly chaff, Kendrick,</said> exclaimed
Dick, now really angry. <said>I'll leave you to make
to the others the apology you owe me for those
fairy tales of yours. I'm off to the billiard-room.
I'm drawn to play Jack Hurst in the subs'
handicap.</said></p>

<p>He turned brusquely away, but had not gone
half a dozen paces before he heard hasty steps
behind him, and a hand descended on his
shoulder. Howard Kendrick had followed him.</p>

<p><said>I haven't really riled you, have I, Dick?</said>
said he.</p>

<p><said>I don't know about being riled. I can only
say it was beastly bad form to say what you did
before the other fellows. I saw Sam Chaffins
taking it all in. He's the busybody of the regi-
ment, as you know well enough. He's certain to
<pb n="19"/>
make the most of it, and if it reaches the ears of
Colonel Waring——</said></p>

<p><said>And Ruth Armitage?</said> put in Kendrick in
his drawling way.</p>

<p><said>And Ruth Armitage if you like,</said> rejoined
Dick fiercely. <said>Anyhow, it's bound to do me
no good.</said></p>

<p><said>My dear Dick, you take things too seriously.
It's nothing for a fellow to have a fancy for a
dancing-girl.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, I haven't. I'd like to run straight.
I've no money to fool away, and as soon as I get
my P.H. I want to get an appointment away
from the army and settle down.</said></p>

<p><said>That's the ambition of all of us, so we needn't
discuss it. I'd like to make it clear about
Adala. There really wasn't so much exaggera-
tion in what I said as you seem to imagine. You
dipped pretty deeply into the Nana's champagne,
and you've forgotten a good deal.</said></p>

<p>Dick Heron made no reply. He knew it was
so, but he felt sure he had not behaved so
stupidly as Kendrick would have him believe.</p>
<p><said>If you like, I'll tell you exactly what hap-
pened,</said> went on Kendrick.</p>
<p><said>You needn't trouble,</said> said Dick coldly.
<said>My memory's good enough, thank you.</said></p>
<p>He wheeled round abruptly, and entered the
billiard-room. He was glad to get away from
Kendrick. There was something in the latter's
manner which jarred on his nerves. It was
almost as though he wanted to force a quarrel
upon him.</p>

<head type="main">The Girl with the Madonna Face</head>

<p>The billiard-room was insufferably hot. Two
limp cadets were struggling through a languid
game. Dick Heron's match was not to come off
until the evening, and he had no object in coming
to the billiard-room other than to escape from
the embarrassing chaff of Kendrick and the rest.</p>
<p>Three men were talking in low voices at the
end of the room. One of these was Jack Hurst.
Dick approached the group, and Hurst catching
sight of him disengaged himself from his friends.</p>
<p><said>I'm glad you've looked in. I wanted to see
you,</said> said Hurst hurriedly. <said>We shall have to
postpone our match to-night. I'm off to Benares
on special service.</said></p>
<p>Jack Hurst was on Sir Hugh Wheeler's staff, and
one could hardly say there was anything strange
in this sudden mission. But the look of serious-
ness on Hurst's good-humoured countenance
struck Dick Heron with a sense of uneasiness.</p>
<p><said>Anything wrong?</said> said he.</p>
<p><said>No—that is, it's as well to look into things.</said></p>
<p>The other men of the group were arguing, and
raised their voices.</p>
<p><said>I tell you, Standridge, your fears are all
moonshine,</said> said one, Captain Rippon of the
2nd Light Cavalry, a native regiment of horse
<pb n="21"/>
stationed at Cawnpore. <said>I've passed twenty
years in India, and I'd trust my men anywhere.
They're absolutely loyal. There's not a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">sowar</foreign>
who wouldn't lay down his life for me.</said></p>
<p><said>Glad you think so, Rippon. I'm not so sure.
This Barrackpore business has a very ugly look.</said></p>
<p><said>I know—I know; but General Hearsey
nipped the thing in the bud. We shall hear no
more of it,</said> broke in Rippon impatiently.</p>
<p><said>But the greased cartridge grievance——</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, damn the greased cartridges. A great
deal too much has been made of the wretched
affair. All we have to do is to be firm and the
thing will die away.</said></p>
<p><said>You may find it easy to be firm with your
men, Rippon, but you're an exception. The
trouble is that the sepoys no longer regard our
<q>firmness.</q> The infantry do as they like.
They're openly indifferent, and things which in
Madras or Bombay would be punished are passed
over in Bengal. I was on the parade ground
this morning, and could not help seeing the sneers
on the faces of the men when a youngster of a
subaltern was wigging a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">havildar</foreign> of twice his age.</said></p>
<p>Dick Heron jerked his head over his shoulder
towards the speaker. Without a doubt he him-
self was the <soCalled>youngster</soCalled> referred to.</p>
<p><said>Whether the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">havildar</foreign> had or had not com-
mitted any offence, and whether the lieutenant
was right or wrong isn't the point,</said> went on
Deputy-Commissioner Standridge. <said>What I
contend is that the majority of sepoys haven't
the same respect for their officers they had years
ago. They've been spoiled, pampered, allowed to
<pb n="22"/>
have their own way—and if a crisis ever comes
it's very doubtful if we can rely upon them.</said></p>
<p><said>You're an alarmist, Standridge. You see things
with the eye of a civilian. You don't mix among
the men as we do. You don't know their attach-
ment to us and their loyalty to the Company.</said></p>
<p>The voices dropped, and Dick Heron no longer
heard distinctly. That which had reached him,
however, excited his curiosity, and increased his
vague uneasiness.</p>
<p><said>What's this Barrackpore affair?</said> he asked
Hurst abruptly.</p>
<p><said>Nothing of very great importance; but there's
no harm in your knowing so long as you keep
your knowledge to yourself. I'll swear the news
has long since reached the rank and file and is
buzzed about in their bazaars, of course more or
less exaggerated. Those bazaars are hotbeds of
lies and intrigue, and it would be all the better for
English rule in India if they could be stamped out.</said></p>
<p>Hurst was talking nonsense, and he knew it.
He might as well have demanded the stamping
out of the religions of the natives as the stamp-
ing out of their bazaars. At Cawnpore the
military bazaars were numerous, and their repu-
tation was very bad. Each regiment had its
own bazaar; and the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">goojurs</foreign>—otherwise highway
robbers; <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign>—as the riffraff are called;
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dacoits</foreign>, and even Thugs mingled freely with
the dealers in necessities and dainties. Not less
than 40,000 persons out of the 50,000 which
constituted the population of Cawnpore—the
majority of them beggars, thieves and worse—
congregated in these dens.</p>
<pb n="23"/>
<p><said>The business that takes me to Benares con-
cerns the Barrackpore outbreak,</said> said Hurst.
<said>General Wheeler's anxious to know what
<choice><corr>Spottiswoode</corr><orig>Spottiswood</orig></choice>, who's in command there, thinks.
He may have some more information than we
possess. The facts, so far as they've reached us,
are these. About six weeks ago the 19th Bengal
Native Infantry at Berhampore refused to obey
orders; the regiment was disarmed and marched
down to Barrackpore, a hundred miles or so
away, and there disbanded. Apparently this
was the end of the affair, but it wasn't so. Soon
after the men were at Barrackpore a fellow
named Mungul Pandy, of the 34th, ran amok in
front of the lines, yelling <q>Come out, you black-
guards! The Europeans are upon us! From
biting these cartridges we shall become infidels!
Get ready! Turn out, all of you!</q></said></p>
<p><said>By Jove,</said> cried Heron excitedly, <said>I hope
the rascal was shot down.</said></p>
<p><said>It was the other way about. He shot and
wounded the adjutant and sergeant-major, who
tried to secure him. The Colonel came on the
scene, but rather muffed the business. The men
began to be excited, took no notice of his orders,
and things were looking ugly when General
Hearsey rode on to the ground and ordered the
guard to secure the fellow. Hearsey's son went
with them, pistol in hand, and Mungul Pandy
caved in—shot himself. He's in the hospital,
and I guess when he's well enough he'll be
hanged. Seven companies of the 34th were dis-
banded, and that's the story—whether it's going
to be continued in our next I'd rather not say.</said></p>
<pb n="24"/>
<p><said>What do you think?</said> asked Dick. <said>Do you
side with Captain Rippon or with Standridge?</said></p>
<p><said>I'll tell you when I come back from Benares.
If the niggers really think their religion is going
to be attacked by the compulsory use of those
confounded greased cartridges, we shall find it
out at Benares, the Hindoos' holy city. Good-
bye, old chap. I haven't any time to spare.</said></p>
<p>Hurst hurried away. Dick would have ques-
tioned Captain Rippon and Standridge, but both
were gone, and having no interest in the two
languid <q>griffins</q> at the billiard table, Dick
sauntered out, avoiding Kendrick and his set
purposely. He could hear their voices in the
mess-room, accompanied by the popping of soda-
water corks, and in the penitent mood of the
moment he was in no mind to join them either
in talking or drinking.</p>
<p>The club-house was on the west side of the
Ganges canal running south from the river. To
the east were the native cantonments, extending
some six miles along the bank of the Ganges. Dick
strolled towards the English church, which, with
its white tower in the midst of a cluster of trees
is about the most conspicuous object in Cawnpore.
Converted into a purely military station by the
East India Company, Cawnpore has no ancient
temples and palaces like Delhi and Lucknow.
It is and was distinguished for nothing but its
manufactories of saddles and other leather goods.</p>
<p>Jack Hurst's sinister piece of news had
obliterated the impression of Kendrick's un-
palatable badinage, and with the possibility of
native disturbances there came into Dick Heron's
<pb n="25"/>
mind the picture of a girl who was beginning to
be regarded as the belle of the station, greatly
to the dissatisfaction of the reigning beauties.</p>
<p>Ruth Armitage, the daughter of Colonel
Waring's comrade, Captain Armitage, killed at
the siege of Mooltan nine years before, and the
Colonel's ward, had always been very <soCalled>nice</soCalled>
to Lieutenant Dick Heron. They were much of
an age, and there was a further link between
them in the discovery they had made, that they
had acquaintances in the same circle in London,
though the two had never met in England, where
Ruth, according to custom, had been sent to be
educated. Indeed, Ruth had met Philip Heron,
Dick's elder and only brother, just after he
returned from the Crimea, and Dick's eyes
sparkled when the girl spoke enthusiastically of
the handsome dashing hussar, and of the share
he had had in the memorable Balaclava charge.
Ruth had stayed a short time with Amy, Dick's
sister, and so it came about that not long after
their introduction they began to feel that they
were old friends.</p>
<p>Dick sauntered along the Chandun Choke, or
<soCalled>Street of Silver,</soCalled> as the main highway of
Cawnpore is called, pursuing the train of thought
set in motion by Standridge's words.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">It would be awful if &#x2026; what nonsense.
It's ridiculous to think of rebellion in India, in
spite of Standridge's croakings—it was like his
dashed impudence to criticise me and the wigging
I gave my <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">havildar</foreign> this morning. What the
deuce does a deputy-commissioner know about
military matters? The officers who mix with
<pb n="26"/>
the men every day of their lives are, as Rippon
says, likely to be the best judges. I admit I was
a little <soCalled>rusty</soCalled> with Kulloo Bux, but as for
the sneers—Standridge imagined he saw them.
The sepoys are all right; if mischief happens
it will come from the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign>. The gaols are
crowded with the scum.</said></p>
<p>Dick was half tempted to loiter among the
native shops and try to ascertain the views of
the proprietors on the vexed question of the
cartridges, about which ugly rumours had spread
that hog's fat had been used in the manufacture,
but he recollected Captain Rippon's warning, that
too much fuss had already been made about the
business, and he decided that he might do more
harm than good by talking, especially as his stock
of Hindustani was limited, and he was likely to
misunderstand anything that might be said.</p>
<p>So he sauntered along the Delhi road in the
direction of his quarters, noting all the signs of
the solidity and permanence of the British rule,
in the theatre, the assembly rooms, the stores of
the English merchants, the club-houses, and in
the distance the compounds of the officers and the
officials of the Anglo-Indian Civil Service, where
fruit and vegetables, European as well as native
varieties, grew in profusion and without much
labour in their culture.</p>
<p>There were not many English to be seen in
the streets, but this was nothing. It was the
hottest part of the day, and those who could do so
kept within the shade and coolness of their bunga-
lows. All was placid; the usual air of indolence
prevailed.</p>
<pb n="27"/>
<p>Dick reached his bungalow, strove to whet his
appetite with a curry, went to sleep for a couple
of hours, awoke not very much refreshed, had a
bath, and finally dressed himself in the orthodox
white linen jacket, highly starched, ditto trousers,
and cummerbund. Then he ordered his buggy
and set out to kill time till dinner at the mess.</p>
<p>Dick's penitent mood still lingered. The
dregs of the mad time at the Nana's palace the
previous night had not subsided. He would like
to chase his black thoughts away by allowing
them to dwell on something that was pure and
innocent. He had a reluctance in facing Ruth
Armitage in his present state of mind; but what
influence was like hers? Yes, he would call on
Colonel Waring, or rather on <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring; he
was justified in so doing even as a matter of
form, seeing that it was the hour when the officers'
wives received their friends.</p>
<p>As Dick Heron neared Colonel Waring's
bungalow, he saw a buggy driving away in the
opposite direction. The dazzling sun, and the hot
air quivering as though it had come from the mouth
of a furnace distorted the vision, and Dick could
not distinctly see the occupant of the vehicle.</p>
<p><said>Who is that, Hazaree Lall?</said> he asked his
servant.</p>
<p><said>Sahib Kendrick,</said> was the reply.</p>
<p>Dick pinched his lips. He was conscious of an
odd pang of annoyance. It was very absurd,
for Kendrick surely had a perfect right to call on
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring and Ruth Armitage.</p>
<p>Dick descended from his buggy and walked
through the compound, gay with the gorgeous
<pb n="28"/>
flowers of the East, to the verandah, beneath
the canopy of which half a dozen white-turbaned
dusky figures were squatting. One rose, sa-
laamed, and took in Dick's name. The prattle
and laughter of women could be heard from
within, mingled with the strains of Thalberg's
<q>Home, sweet home.</q> Dick Heron loathed the
piece. He had heard Miss Cummings, the
<soCalled>crack</soCalled> pianist of Cawnpore, struggle with its
serpentine wanderings times out of number.</p>
<p>The servant ushered him in, and soon he was
in <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring's drawing-room, threading the
maze of spindle-legged tables, loaded with
curios, and making his way towards a group of
ladies in muslin dresses, ample in skirt and
flounced almost up to the waist.</p>
<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring, a tall, fragile-looking, willowy
woman, with the languid, faded air of the middle-
aged Anglo-Indian lady, shook hands with the
young man, and inclined her swan-like neck
condescendingly and coldly, Dick thought. As a
rule she was very gracious and smiling. To-day
her smile was decidedly acid. One of the ladies
standing by her looked at Dick inquiringly, and
evidently with approval. Unless <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring
wished to be rude she could hardly avoid intro-
ducing him. She did so, and the lady froze
instantly. Dick was perfectly conscious of her
changed demeanour, and stood somewhat mysti-
fied and embarrassed. An interchange of a few
commonplaces, and he was left to amuse himself
with the photographic albums which were then in-
dispensable for the entertainment of one's guests.</p>
<p>Photographs did not interest him in the least;
<pb n="29"/>
his eyes were roaming in search of the girl he
had come to see. She was not there; no doubt
she was one of the audience listening to Miss
Cummings's pounding, twiddling, and her rocket-
like scales. For the moment Dick was evidently
a person of no importance, and he had no diffi-
culty about slipping away in search of his
divinity.</p>
<p>Once more he threaded the maze of furniture
and knick-knacks, and was about to cross the
passage to the music-room when a girl, slim and
graceful as a fawn, suddenly emerged from the
doorway on the other side. She was rather
below the middle height; perfectly proportioned,
the soft gauzy Indian muslin clinging to her
shoulders and arms accentuating their curves.
Her dark chestnut hair was arranged in smooth
shining bands each side of her forehead, coming
down rather low, but not so low as to conceal
the small well-shaped ears. The fashion suited
her regular features and gave her a Madonna-
like aspect, the more attractive because of
its modesty.</p>
<p>Directly she saw Dick Heron she stopped, and
would have withdrawn into the room behind her,
but for his crossing the passage in a couple of
strides, holding out both hands. He could be
demonstrative now without remark; the Hindoo
servants did not count.</p>
<p><said>Ruth!</said> he exclaimed.</p>
<p>If <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring was cold, Ruth Armitage was
colder. She did not appear to notice his out-
stretched hand, and she remained within the
draped doorway to which she had retreated.</p>
<pb n="30"/>
<p><said>I did not expect to see you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Heron,</said> she
faltered.</p>
<p><q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Heron</q>; and until that afternoon it had
always been Dick!</p>
<p><said>You did not expect,</said> he repeated, almost as
agitated as the girl. <said>Why not?</said></p>
<p><said>Please don't ask me. There's no need.
Surely you must know.</said></p>
<p>Her embarrassment was slowly giving place to
anger. The even, creamy tint of her complexion
was heightened by the spot of crimson blazing
in her cheeks. Dick Heron's nerves were un-
strung. The slightest thing going awry just then
was sufficient for him to lose his control. Ruth's
manner, her words, stung him to the quick.</p>
<p><said>I don't know,</said> he returned curtly, <said>or I
shouldn't have asked. But it's very clear I'm
not welcome, so I wish you good evening, Miss
Armitage.</said></p>
<p>He bowed stiffly and turned. He never saw
the sudden quiver of the finely cut lips, the re-
morseful, yearning look in the eyes, the fading of
the crimson in the cheeks. He stalked away, cool
outwardly, but inwardly thrilling with passion.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">I said I didn't know,</said> he muttered, <said aloud="false">nor
do I, but I'm not such an ass that I can't guess
what's amiss. Something's got wind about that
stupid business of last night. Kendrick's at the
bottom of it, the cad! He was a sneak at
Addiscombe, and once a sneak, always a sneak.
I'll have it out with him, by Heaven I will! He
must have been spreading his lies this afternoon.
He took jolly good care to clear out before I
showed up.</said></p>

<head type="main">A Message from the Dancing-Girl</head>

<p>Dick Heron was not master of himself. Every-
thing that day had been a cause of irritation.
The intensely dry heat, the suffocating air, had
affected his nerves, and at the moment he was at
war with the world. He jumped into his buggy,
hardly giving his servant time to mount, and
drove furiously to head-quarters. He burned to
come face to face with Kendrick, but before
doing anything he must have a <soCalled>peg.</soCalled></p>
<p>Arrived at head-quarters, he threw the reins to
his servant and hastened to the smoking-room.
He had made up his mind that if Kendrick were
there he would tackle him on the spot. But no
Kendrick could be seen, and Dick had his <soCalled>peg</soCalled>
of brandy, and then another and another. There
was, he found, not much chance of meeting
Howard Kendrick until perhaps late at night.
Kendrick, so he was told, had gone a journey of
some five miles to look at a horse he thought of
buying, and would most likely dine with the
vendor.</p>
<p>Dick's inquiries naturally led the conversation
in the direction of Kendrick, and two or three men
were not sorry to discuss him freely. They had
<pb n="32"/>
reason to do so, for Kendrick had not paid the
bets he had lost over the last races.</p>
<p><said>How did he use you, Heron?</said> asked one
man.</p>
<p><said>I had nothing on with him,</said> said Dick
shortly. <said>He already owed me money, and I
didn't care to give him the chance of increasing
the debt. It isn't money matters I want to see
him about.</said></p>
<p>Dick flung himself into a long cane chair, lit a
cheroot and gloomily smoked. The others went
on gossiping; and from their gossip it was pretty
clear that the general opinion was that Kendrick
had not of late been running straight.</p>
<p>Although Dick Heron and Kendrick were at
Addiscombe at the same time, they were not
much together. They were in different <soCalled>sets,</soCalled>
and Kendrick left a year before Heron. He was
generally spoken of as <q>that Kendrick,</q> which
would seem to imply he was not held in high
favour; but Dick knew nothing definitely against
him, and when they met at Cawnpore, Dick
Heron, a stranger, was glad enough to fraternise
with some one with whom he could compare notes
about old Addiscombe times.</p>
<p>The mess dinner was not served until seven,
and in the meantime Dick, having steadied his
nerves with the assistance of <soCalled>pegs,</soCalled> discovered
that he had pretty well forgotten his troubles and
took his share in the frivolous talk that followed.</p>
<p>When the talk languished, some one proposed
<soCalled>fly loo,</soCalled> as a diversion for the final half hour
before dinner, and Dick made one in the pastime
—probably the simplest form of gambling known
<pb n="33"/>
to man. All that one had to do was to sit with
a little heap of sugar on the table before you and
wait patiently until a fly chose to settle on the
dainty. You were at liberty to bet what you
liked, within a limit, on your chance, and you
either received the stakes all round, or paid
according to whether the fly preferred your heap
or that of one of your neighbours.</p>
<p>Dick lost half a sovereign at this excitement
before dinner was announced, and having cheer-
fully paid up, sauntered with the others into the
mess-room. He had gone through this routine
until he was sick of it; but there was nothing else
to be done, and so far as he knew, nothing else
ever would be done.</p>
<p>The chatter during dinner was of the orthodox
aimless kind—the chances of promotion, the
probabilities of the next horse race, the billiard
handicap, the latest scandal. Apparently, in the
general aspect of things there was nothing differ-
ent to-night from any other night, but somehow
everybody was conscious that the gaiety was
feverish and artificial. The decanter was passed
round with more than customary frequency, the
voices were louder, the stories more of the barrack-
room class than usual. Suddenly came in a
stentorian voice the words:</p>
<p><said>I tell all of you fellows straight, that the
niggers mean to drive us into the <soCalled>black
water,</soCalled> if they once get the chance. You're as
blind as bats—the whole lot of you. <emph>I</emph> know,
and you don't.</said></p>
<p>The voice was that of Captain Tom Ingram,
who had spent half his life in India, who knew
<pb n="34"/>
almost as much about the natives as the natives
themselves, yet had never advanced in rank
beyond his captaincy. He was a splendid
soldier, but no disciplinarian, as discipline
understood by the orthodox, and he was far too
blunt and outspoken to please his superiors.
Moreover he had a leaning towards <soCalled>pegs.</soCalled>
Maybe this tendency stood in the way of his
advancement.</p>
<p>Ingram's words fell like a bombshell. The
frivolity was checked, a curious silence followed.</p>
<p>The man to whom Ingram was talking, Major
Parry—an honest fellow enough, but narrow-
minded and inclined to be <soCalled>goody-goody;</soCalled> he
never missed going to church every Sunday, and
believed in the possibility of Christianising the
whole of India—murmured something about the
<q>beneficence of the English rule,</q> and the efforts
of the missionaries.</p>
<p><said>Christianity is all-powerful. I can't think
the native army would turn against their friends,</said>
said he. <said>Once let this unfortunate matter of
the greased cartridges——</said></p>
<p><said>For Heaven's sake, Parry, don't talk rot,</said>
burst out Ingram, springing to his feet. <said>I'm
sick of the cartridge business. It's only the
outward and visible sign of what's been simmer-
ing unsuspected for years. Listen to me. I
was in Lucknow five years ago, in the time of
Shah Wazid Ali, the last king of Oudh. He'd a
notion of reorganising his army, but that didn't
suit the British Resident, who was curious to
know his game. He hadn't any game. He was
simply hungering for something to do. <said>Oh,</said>
<pb n="35"/>
said the Resident, <said>if you think you're not safe
you'd better employ British troops.</said> Well—
but I'm boring you. What's the good of my
talking?</said></p>
<p>Ingram flopped into his seat and filled his
glass with an unsteady hand, bestowing a liberal
quantity on the table. There was a chorus of
<said>Go on—go on.</said> Ingram had unconsciously
brought to the surface the undercurrent of
thought which had been surging beneath the
frivolity. Ingram might be addicted to <soCalled>pegs</soCalled>
and <soCalled>brandy pawnees,</soCalled> but when he chose to
speak earnestly, he knew what he was talking
about.</p>
<p><said>Oh, it's <q>go on,</q> is it?</said> said he, once more
rising, clutching the edge of the table and sway-
ing slightly. <said>All right. The continuation of
the story is that Shah Wazid finding himself
snubbed, chucked up soldiering for <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">nautch</foreign> girls,
and went the pace. Practically, the king took
a back seat, and Rajah Dursham Sing came
along. This nabob had three sons—Buktour
Sing, Durshin Sing, and Cholawka Sing. The
king let them do just what they damn please,
and they did it with a vengeance. Durshin Sing
was a horse leech to the backbone, and grabbed
every inch of land in Fyzabad he could lay hold
of. But he went further. There was a mosque
near Fyzabad which he annexed with other
property; and his sons, strict Brahmins, refused
to allow the <q>Arjan</q>—that's the call to prayer,
you know—to be sounded from the mosque.
Pass the decanter, Parry.</said></p>
<p>Talking always made Tom Ingram dry. He
<pb n="36"/>
refreshed himself. Meanwhile Dick Heron sat
with glistening eyes fixed on the stalwart cap-
tain. The wine Dick had drunk, following the
brandy, had set his nerves quivering. Ruth's
anger, and his suspicions that Kendrick had
slandered him were still rankling. He was ready
to pick a quarrel with anybody. He felt in-
tensely vainglorious, and was quite prepared to
stand up against the world for the invincibility
of England. Ingram's opening words had irri-
tated him, and he was burning to interrupt.</p>
<p><said>Now, then, see what sprang out of this piece
of oppression,</said> continued Ingram. <said>A travel-
ling Moulvie came along, and, knowing nothing
of Durshin Sing's orders, went into the mosque
to say his prayers after the fashion of his kind,
and sounded the <q>Arjan.</q> The fat was in the
fire at once; the Brahmins gave the Moulvie a
thrashing; off went the Moulvie to the kind for
redress; one thing led to another; there was a
jolly shindy between the Brahmins and Mahom-
edans, with the upshot we were called in to
adjust matters. Of course, we did it in our
usual fashion, and put an end to the row by
deposing the king of Oudh and collaring his
kingdom.</said></p>
<p><said>And why shouldn't we?</said> shouted Dick
furiously—he had got the opening he had been
waiting for. <said>Aren't the niggers much better off
under our rule than under their own?</said></p>
<p>Dick's tone was aggressive, and a look of
apprehension was apparent in the faces of some
of the men. Dick's nearest neighbour gripped
the young lieutenant's arm and told him to <q>shut
<pb n="37"/>
up.</q> Ingram could be very quarrelsome when
he liked, and when he was quarrelsome he was
dangerous. To everybody's surprise, however,
he remained perfectly unmoved by the outburst.
Indeed, he regarded Dick's eager, boyish face
somewhat pityingly.</p>
<p><said>You're a youngster,</said> he returned, <said>and you
only repeat like a parrot what you've heard.
You'd better let me finish. Oudh became
ours last year, and what happened? Why,
thousands of men who had been in the King's
service were thrown out of employment. They
had never done anything in their lives but fight,
and finding themselves stranded they've gone to
swell the swarms of <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign> (riffraff), who are
only waiting for the signal to plunder. I don't
care what you fellows think; I only say that if
I were a native of Oudh, I should consider the
annexation a gross piece of injustice, and I
should rebel against it.</said></p>
<p>Dick sprang up in spite of the efforts of his
neighbour to restrain him.</p>
<p><said>You've no right to say such things, Captain
Ingram. It's as good as treason,</said> he cried, <said>to
talk like that in the hearing of those niggers.</said></p>
<p>Dick pointed to two <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgars</foreign>, or waiters,
who were moving noiselessly at the end of the
room apparently indifferent to everything but
their duties.</p>
<p><said>Oh, you're right,</said> said Ingram with a shrug
of the shoulders, and subduing his voice slightly.</p>
<p><said>It sounds like treason; at the same time,
it's common sense. Bundle those fellows out,
and you chaps draw closer. Now that I'm on
<pb n="38"/>
this business I'd better finish it. It's no good
living in a fool's paradise.</said></p>
<p>There was something strangely serious in In-
gram's voice and manner, and the men around
the table obeyed him; most of them conscious
of a sudden disquieting sensation of insecurity.
There was not one there who did not know that
the safety, nay, that the lives, of the few thou-
sand English men and women in India depended
entirely on the fidelity of the native troops.
Ingram went on:</p>
<p><said>You all know that the 19th and 34th were
stationed at Lucknow, but what you don't
know is that directly Oudh passed into our
hands there were signs that something had gone
wrong with both regiments. No one knew ex-
actly what it was; the fellows were too cunning
to show their hands, you bet. Anyhow, when
the annual change of troops came about at the
beginning of this year, and the 19th were sent to
Berhampore, and the 34th to Barrackpore, the
authorities at Lucknow were jolly glad to get
rid of them, and hoped by sending them
away and separating them that the mischief
was stopped. They're wrong. It's only just
beginning. You'll see.</said></p>
<p>Ingram's forebodings were listened to with
incredulity. His comrades expected something
much worse. What was the insubordination of
two regiments worth in the face of the staunch-
ness of the great body of native troops? It was
not strange that the 19th and 34th, fresh from
Lucknow, with her new masters and smarting
under the loss of her king, should be disaffected,
<pb n="39"/>
but the matter was not likely to go further.
Nearly every man present was of one opinion on
this point. Ingram was unanimously voted to
be a prophet of evil, and the younger officers
were the loudest in expressing their condemnation
of his rash speculations.</p>
<p>The talk became excited, the fiery sherry and
the sweet champagne went round, men shouted
one against the other, and the only silent one of
the company was Tom Ingram himself. He sat
smoking a big cheroot, apparently indifferent to
what was going on. He'd said all he cared to
say, and that was enough for him.</p>
<p>The air was insufferable, and the monotonous
din of voices had probably had a soporific effect on
the punkah wallahs, for the ventilating apparatus
moved but languidly. Dick and two or three of
his chums went for coolness outside the bungalow.</p>
<p>There was no moon, but the pale sky was
spangled with stars, and to Dick's excited fancy
the scene was tinged with romance. His
senses were exalted. A good deal of nonsense
had been talked during the last hour about the
wonderful deeds of Clive, Cornwallis, Wellesley,
Baird, and the rest who had led the English
troops to victory in the early days of the con-
quest of India; and what with brandy and sherry
and champagne, he felt warlike and reckless.
He longed for adventure. It can hardly be said
he had forgotten either Ruth Armitage or
Howard Kendrick, but when he thought of them
it was with the sense of having been slighted,
and he was eager to show both that he was not
the boy they apparently thought he was.</p>
<pb n="40"/>
<p>The men he was with were typical young Eng-
lishmen of the period; they could only talk shop
and scandal. Dick was in the mood for neither.</p>
<p><said>I'm off,</said> said he, abruptly.</p>
<p><said>Aren't you staying for vingt-et-un? We
shall have a round presently,</said> said one.</p>
<p><said>No, thanks. I'm going for a quiet stroll.
Shall turn in early. I'm done up. It was a bit
thick last night.</said></p>
<p><said>At the Nana's? Yes, I heard about it.
Jolly lucky beggar you were to have an invite.
I say, what are his dancing-girls like? I'm told
the one called Adala is a ripping beauty. Did
you see her?</said></p>
<p><said>I suppose I did. I don't know,</said> returned
Dick shortly.</p>
<p>He wheeled round, said good night, and strode
away muttering, <said>I wish Lambert hadn't re-
minded me of Adala. I'd like to forget her.</said></p>
<p>So prudence told him, but he found it difficult
in his present state of mind to check his thoughts.
He hurried along, hoping exercise would quiet
his nerves. He was nearing the main street when
he felt his arm lightly touched. He turned, on
his guard instantly, for Cawnpore swarmed with
miscreants who would as lief murder as rob. He
saw a tall woman, veiled in native fashion, close
to him.</p>
<p><said>Sahib, sahib,</said> she whispered rapidly. <said>For-
tune smiles upon you. I am the bearer of good
news. I have been waiting. If I had not seen
you to-night I should have come to-morrow;
and if I was not lucky to-morrow, the next
night, and the next.</said></p>
<pb n="41"/>
<p><said>What are you talking about? Who are
you?</said> demanded Dick.</p>
<p><said>You don't remember me. I am Hooseinee
Khanum, Adala's hand-maiden. I saw you last
night at Bithoor.</said></p>
<p>She shifted her veil slightly, and he recognised
her face. The features were very regular and
not unpleasing, save as to the mouth. The lips
were very full, clearly cut, and sphinx-like in
their entire absence of expression. They were
like those of the Hindoo god Siva, as he is pic-
tured, implacable, relentless, blood-thirsty.</p>
<p><said>Well, what is it?</said> asked Dick hesitatingly.</p>
<p><said>Adala wants you,</said> she returned, her lips
parting with a swift motion, showing her red,
betel-stained teeth. <said>You must come. She
sends you this token. You must never part with
it.</said></p>
<p>She held out a blood-red ruby set in gold and
attached to a fine gold chain. Dick took the
trinket wonderingly. She went on to whisper
insinuatingly that Adala had something of the
utmost importance to say to him, and that it
must be said as soon as possible, that night
preferably.</p>
<p><said>A carriage is at hand,</said> said she. <said>I can
take the Sahib to Adala in half an hour.</said></p>
<p>It was not late, scarcely ten o'clock. The
promise of an adventure, the sense of mystery,
the charm and fascination of Adala herself—all
were attractive, especially so in the mood in
which he then was. But he hesitated.</p>
<p><said>What does Adala want to tell me?</said> he
asked.</p>
<pb n="42"/>
<p><said>How should Hooseinee know? She is but a
lowly servant. She is not worthy to be entrusted
with Adala's secrets.</said></p>
<p>Dick Heron could not be but conscious of the
subtle influence of this woman. The liquid
voice, the large mystic eyes, the supple body,
swathed in the picturesque one garment which
the Eastern woman winds about her so deftly
and artistically, the faint perfume, sweet yet
pungent, she exhaled, formed a combination of
allurements difficult to withstand. Even the
mouth and the scarlet teeth, repulsive and sug-
gestive of savagery when regarded separately,
had their influence in accentuating and impart-
ing piquancy to her charms.</p>
<p><said>Come,</said> she breathed softly; and the light of
devilry danced in her eyes as she beckoned him.
There was temptation in the curves of her arm,
in the jingle of her bangles.</p>
<p>He capitulated—not in words, but in obeying
her summons to follow her. She covered her
face and silently took her way to a road leading
in the direction of the Ganges Canal. Here a
carriage, which Dick knew belonged to Nana
Sahib—the Maharajah affected everything Eng-
lish, and he had had this carriage made in
London—was in waiting.</p>
<p>Hooseinee Khanum gathered up her drapery,
shrank into her corner of the carriage, and sat,
a veiled, mysterious figure, motionless as a statue.
She was perfectly silent, and Dick construed her
silence to mean that having fulfilled her mission
she had no further interest in him. Dick did
not attempt to disturb the stillness; he allowed
<pb n="43"/>
his mind to dwell on mystery and romance, and
his thoughts were not unpleasant, for whatever
might be the end of the adventure, up to the
present it was gratifying to his vanity.</p>
<p>The carriage was of light construction; it was
drawn by a couple of powerful horses, which the
driver put to the top of their speed. Hooseinee
Khanum talked about taking him to their
destination in half an hour, the half hour soon
passed, and still the horses were tearing along
the dusty road. Dick was not surprised. If he
were being conveyed to the Nana's palace at
Bithoor he hew the journey could not be done
in half an hour.</p>
<p>The time went by quickly; Dick was conscious
of a strange feeling of lethargy not altogether
unpleasant, of an indifference to everything, even
to the risks he was running, not only to his
personal safety, but to his reputation if the
escapade became known. Some such thoughts
had crossed his mind when he first entered the
carriage, but he had crushed them, or had allowed
them to be crushed by the spell cast about him
by Hooseinee Khanum.</p>

<head type="main">Hooseinee Khanum's Sweetmeats</head>

<p>The carriage entered the compound of
the Bithoor Palace, and stopped, not at the principal
entrance, but at a mean-looking door stuck in
the side of the house. Dick and his companion
alighted, and on seeing where he had been
brought suspicions of treachery flashed across
the young soldier's mind.</p>
<p><said>I believe you're tricking me, you jade,</said> he
exclaimed angrily.</p>
<p><said>If you think so, kill me. Here is my dag-
ger!</said> cried Hooseinee Khanum, flinging back
her head in defiance, her hand going swiftly to
her girdle. By this time the moon had risen,
and its light flashed on the blade. Hooseinee
forced its jewelled hilt into his hand.</p>
<p><said>I have been told Englishmen are as brave
in love as they are fearless in war. Do those who
say this lie?</said> she asked sarcastically. <said>What
enemies have the English within the Nana's
palace? Does Adala hate them? See, Sahib,
I will walk first, and if there is treachery, bury
the knife in my heart. There is no danger but
what a coward might imagine.</said></p>
<p>She marched proudly in front of him to the
door. The sting in her words galled him.</p>
<pb n="45"/>
<p><said>Take your dagger. I don't want it,</said> said
he huskily. <said>Lead on; I'll follow you—to the
devil if you like.</said></p>
<p>She turned, fell at his feet and accepted the
dagger humbly.</p>
<p><said>You are a brave—you are a warrior, Sahib,</said>
she cried. <said>This entrance is not worthy
your lordship, but do you not understand?
It is Adala who wishes to see you—not the
Nana.</said></p>
<p>Hooseinee placed her finger to her lips in token
of secrecy, and accompanied the words with a
glance of meaning from her glistening eyes.
There was, in her look and gesture, temptation
combined with danger. Dick might have
resisted the first, but the second provoked him
to defiance. She saw the battle was won, and
rising, disappeared within the dark doorway.
Dick followed her.</p>
<p>The passage was straight and narrow, and a
hanging lamp enabled Dick to see that he and
his companion were alone, but who could say
enemies were not awaiting them? In the event
of an attack he had but his fists with which to
defend himself. It would have been more
prudent to have retained possession of the
dagger. But it was too late for regrets. What-
ever might be the consequences, he must battle
through them.</p>
<p>Hooseinee Khanum dragged apart the heavy
curtains at the end of the passage; beyond was
a kind of lobby with a dome-shaped roof. On
the walls were Eastern weapons of ancient date,
matchlock guns, swords, broad and narrow
<pb n="46"/>
bladed, spears, shields, suits of flexible chain-
armour going back to the days of Akbar and
Suraja Dowla.</p>
<p>There was no furniture; only a few mats were
on the floor, and the apartment was probably
used as a waiting-room for servants. Curtains
concealed a narrow deep recess, in reality a
doorway, for on the woman touching the spring
of the mechanism which locked the door it slid
back into a groove in the wall.</p>
<p>The room into which this sliding door opened
was spacious, sumptuously decorated, and fur-
nished in Eastern fashion. The hangings, the
cushions, the divans were of the finest silk; the
embroideries were of golden thread; costly rugs
covered the floor. Treasures in the way of
inlaid cabinets and bric-à-brac were abundant.</p>
<p>The purely Indian surroundings of the apart-
ment surprised Dick, for the most characteristic
feature of the Nana's palace—that portion at
least where he received his European guests and
gave his dinner-parties and entertainments—was
its English aspect, or, rather, its affectation of
what the Nana imagined an English interior was
like, for he had never seen one—not even the
imitations dear to the hearts of the wives of the
officers and civilians high in authority. The
Nana was profuse in his own hospitality, but he
could not be induced to accept any in return.
None of the English at Cawnpore had ever
received the Maharajah under their roofs.</p>
<p>Dick's experience of the Nana's dinner-parties
had been very much that of the writer who
described his sitting down at what had once been
<pb n="47"/>
the mess table of a cavalry regiment covered with
a tablecloth of the finest damask, with the
accompaniment of bedroom towels for serviettes.
The soup was served in a trifle dish, bought at
the sale of an English officer's effects, and ladled
into odds and ends of crockery, among which
was a broken teacup of the old willow pattern.
The incongruities were numberless. Huge silver
dishes were mingled with common stoneware
plates, bone-handled knives were side by side
with silver spoons and forks, there were not two
vegetable dishes alike; pudding was served on a
soup-plate, and the guests ate their cheese out
of glass dishes. The champagne glasses were
richly cut and the tumblers for beer were cheap
and clumsy.</p>
<p>All was muddle and untidiness, and it was
the more extraordinary because, if rumour spoke
the truth, the Nana's treasurer and confidential
adviser, Azimoolah Khan, had, during a length-
ened stay in London, been received with the
greatest favour by titled ladies, and by them
petted and pampered and lionised, as was the
fashion in the forties and fifties, and he might be
expected to advise the Nana on such household
points as the English regarded as important.</p>
<p>The contrast between the dirt and slovenliness
of the reception-rooms of the Bithoor Palace,
and the magnificence and order to be seen in
what were evidently the Maharajah's private
apartments, impressed itself on Dick's mind,
notwithstanding his bewilderment. The moment,
however, was not one for speculation. His guide
had thrown aside her head covering, and begged
<pb n="48"/>
him to seat himself, while she announced his
arrival to Adala.</p>
<p><said>But first you must eat,</said> said she. <said>Here
are sweetmeats,</said> and she fetched a tray from
a side table.</p>
<p>The tendering of sweetmeats, Dick well knew,
was a high favour to pay a guest; for all that he
hesitated, though he was aware a refusal would
give mortal offence. But if the sweetmeats
should chance to be poisoned? Such <soCalled>acci-
dents</soCalled> were not unknown in the annals of
Indian crime.</p>
<p>Hooseinee Khanum must have guessed what
was in his mind. She broke a sweet in two, ate
one piece herself, and handed the other to Dick.
She was a Mahomedan; had she been a Hindoo
the laws of her caste would have prohibited
such a thing. Dick could not refuse the dainty.
He hated the luscious confections the natives
delighted in, and he had to force the stuff down
his throat.</p>
<p><said>I will tell Adala the Sahib has come. It
will please her,</said> said the woman, her heavy lips
for the first time suggesting a smile.</p>
<p>No sooner was Dick left to himself, than he
was conscious of a feeling of languor and lassi-
tude stealing over him. His inclination was to
throw himself on one of the soft cushions, and,
if not sleep, indulge in roseate waking dreams.</p>
<p><said>It's that cursed sweetmeat,</said> he muttered.
<said>I ought not to have touched the stuff. I
could but have chanced giving offence. Pah!
I was an ass to listen to that confounded woman.
Why did I do it?</said></p>
<pb n="49"/>
<p>This was the puzzle. Now that she was gone
the magnetic influence that drew him onward
was gone too. And Adala? Did he in his
heart want to see the dancing-girl? Was she
really so beautiful as the night before he
imagined she was? He was not so sure. The
glamour of romance with which he had invested
her was merely due to a clouded brain and
overwrought nerves.</p>
<p><said>Folly—folly,</said> he exclaimed. <said>I've simply
justified every lie that cad Kendrick told about
me. What did I do it for? I'd better clear
out while I've got the chance. I shall appear
as a fool and a coward in the eyes of the woman
here, I suppose, but I can't help that.</said></p>
<p>He was staggering across the room to the door
leading to the lobby, when for the first time
his glance fell upon the pictures on the walls.
When he entered he was too much impressed
by the general aspect of Eastern luxury to notice
details. Slowly these details were revealing
themselves like the development of a photo-
graphic plate.</p>
<p>The picture he first caught sight of made him
turn away with a gesture and an exclamation
of disgust. All that the foulness of a depraved
Oriental imagination could suggest was there
depicted. The other pictures were as bad, or
worse. He had heard stories of a mysterious
den of dark infamy possessed by the Nana, but
had looked upon them as idle tales. He knew
now that they were true. Shuddering, he has-
tened to the door. It was locked, but doubtless
if he could but find the spring he could open it.</p>
<pb n="50"/>
<p>He failed to discover anything. The surface
of the door, which was of great solidity, was
perfectly smooth. Resolving not to waste any
time, he went at once towards one of the windows.
Before he reached it, however, he heard Hooseinee
Khanum's voice. She moved quicker than
he, and the next moment she gripped his arm.
Evidently she did not guess his intention, for she
said apologetically:</p>
<p><said>I cannot find Adala. The Sahib must not
be angry with his slave. I am not to blame.</said></p>
<p>Dick seized upon this as a good reason for
escaping from the horrible place, but he thought
it policy not to anger the woman. Doubtless
she would open the door now that there was
no reason why he should remain.</p>
<p><said>Of course you're not to blame,</said> said he
lightly. <said>I'll get back to Cawnpore. I sup-
pose you can find me a horse.</said></p>
<p><said>The Sahib is not going?</said> she cried with
sudden vehemence.</p>
<p><said>By Jove, but the Sahib is. Open the door,
please. Here's the love-token you gave me.
I don't want it.</said></p>
<p><said>No; I will not let you go.</said></p>
<p>Hooseinee Khanum flung her arms about him,
as he threw the jewel on the cushions, and clasped
her hands behind his back. The woman had
changed her costume; she was now but lightly
clad, her arms were bare, enabling her to cling
to him with a tenacity which almost took his
breath away.</p>
<p><said>Don't be a fool. What have you to do with
me?</said> he gasped angrily.</p>
<pb n="51"/>
<p><said>I love you, and you shall not go.</said></p>
<p>The Siva-like mouth hardened, and the eyes
glittered. The glitter might have been that of
love, but it was more suggestive of disappoint-
ment and baulked desire.</p>
<p><said>I don't want to hurt you, but if I do you'll
only have yourself to blame. By Heaven——</said></p>
<p>Directly he tried to release himself, her sinuous
grasp tightened and before he was aware of her
intention she had pressed her full lips on his.
The contact maddened him. Writhing in her
embrace he strove to get free, but in vain. She
was like a snake twined about him, and her grip
had pinned his arms to his sides. She would
have kissed his lips again, but he wrenched his
face round, and her mouth touched his cheek.</p>
<p><said>Shall I tell you the truth, Sahib Heron?</said>
she breathed rapidly between her kisses. <said>Adala
did not send me. It was I who wanted you—
only I, Hooseinee Khanum. But your lordship
has no eyes for the lowly handmaiden. Hooseinee
Khanum is not beautiful like Adala, but she can
love better—far better than the dancing-girl.
That was why I lured you here, that is why I
will not let you go. My lord—my love—I am
your slave. Beat me—kill me, if you like, but
do not leave me. I want you to tell me about
your wonderful land—about your people—
about——</said></p>
<p>Her words died away in guttural sounds.
Failing to loosen her frenzied grasp by his struggle
to free his imprisoned arms, he had by a sudden
jerk of his body swung her off the ground. He
was possessed by savage determination; he
<pb n="52"/>
whirled her once round; the pressure on his arms
relaxed, he was able to use his hands, and he
clutched her arms above the elbows and strove
to tear himself from her by main force.</p>
<p>He was amazed at her virile strength. But
Hooseinee Khanum was no slim weakling of a
Hindoo girl, brought up on a vegetable diet.
She was a mature Mahomedan woman, with
the blood of the old wiry dwellers of the desert
in her veins. She was approaching her thirtieth
year, and her raven hair was streaked with silver.
The force of her embrace was overwhelming,
and it was only when in the twisting and twinings
her elbow struck with great violence the sharp
edge of an ebony cabinet, sending a quiver
through her whole body, that her clenched
hands gave way, and she dropped on the inlaid
floor as though she had been felled by a blow
from his fist.</p>
<p>She remained curled in a huddled heap. After
the impact there was hardly any movement,
and she did not utter the slightest sound. Horri-
fied, the excited lad bent over her, fearing she
was dead. He was soon undeceived. Her chest
was heaving; the hands and feet were shivering
as though they were icy cold; her face he could
not see, covered as it was by her masses of hair
uncoiled in the struggle.</p>
<p><said>I hope I haven't hurt you,</said> he panted; <said>I
couldn't help it if I have. If you're not going
to show me how to leave this accursed trap
decently by the door, I shall look after myself.</said></p>
<p>The woman made no reply. Perhaps she was
unable to speak, not having recovered from the
<pb n="53"/>
shock of her fall; possibly, too, she was exhausted
by the frantic struggle. Dick waited a few
seconds. Faint, choking sounds could now be
heard. She was recovering.</p>
<p><said>Did you hear what I said?</said> he went on
presently.</p>
<p>Again there was silence, and Dick determined
to waste no more time, but carry out his intention
of escaping by the window. He dashed across
the room, and had his hand on the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khuss tatti</foreign>,
when he heard his name called out, not in
Hooseinee Khanum's voice, but in deeper tones.</p>
<p>He turned, and saw standing near the door
leading to the interior of the Palace, a man
whom he knew extremely well—Azimoolah Khan,
the Nana's treasurer.</p>
<p><said>I hope, Lieutenant Heron, I'm not intruding.
I apologise. I was seeking Hooseinee Khanum.
I was not aware she had a visitor.</said></p>
<p>The voice was veiled; the manner soft and
silky. The English language was pronounced
with a perfect accent and with the ease of one
who had not only mastered its difficulties, but
was accustomed to use it. The words were harm-
less enough, but the tones were sinister.</p>
<p>For a moment or two Dick was taken aback.
He did not how how to account for his presence
in the Nana's palace. The position was both
equivocal and embarrassing. A note of gravity
was added by the sight of the prostrate woman.
She was alive, but for anything Dick knew she
might be seriously injured.</p>
<p><said>I'm afraid appearances are against me,
Azimoolah,</said> he stammered. <said>Of course I ought
<pb n="54"/>
to explain; but further than assuring you I was
induced to come here under the impression some
one in the Palace wished to make some important
communication to me, I hardly know what to
say.</said></p>
<p><said>There is no need for an explanation,</said> said
Azimoolah smoothly. <said>I presume the Mahara-
jah is not aware of your visit. If his highness
knew, he would, I am sure, give orders for a
reception more worthy of your exalted rank.</said></p>
<p>Dick felt the sarcasm, but he dared not resent
it. Nor could he say that the person who had
sent him the enticing message was Adala, the
Nana's favourite dancing-girl. The consequences
might be terrible to her. Dick knew well enough
that the princes of India, whether of royal birth
or adoption—as was the case with Nana Sahib—
were swift and fierce to revenge themselves when
their jealousy was excited. There was only one
thing Dick could do, and that was to throw the
responsibility of his presence on Hooseinee
Khanum. After all, it was practically the truth.
He made the plunge.</p>
<p><said>The Maharajah, so far as I am aware, is
ignorant that I'm here,</said> said he. <said>Only Hooseinee
Khanum, who brought me, knows. I had reason
to think she had deceived me. I desired to
leave the palace; she tried to detain me; we
had an altercation—a struggle—and she fell. I
hope she's not hurt.</said></p>
<p><said>It is of no consequence. I regret you have
been put to so much inconvenience. You would
desire to return to Cawnpore? Permit me to
offer you my services.</said></p>
<pb n="55"/>
<p>He bowed low, his gesture suggesting a min-
gling of the stiff courtesy of England with the
humility and self-depreciation of the East.</p>
<p><said>Thank you—but—but I should like to be sure
the woman has come to no harm,</said> returned the
lad hesitatingly.</p>
<p>Azimoolah shrugged his shoulders, contemptu-
ously inserted the point of his foot beneath
Hooseinee Khanum's body and turned her suffi-
ciently to bring her face into view, speaking to her
harshly in a language Dick did not understand.
It did not sound like Hindustani; most likely it
was one of the many dialects in use in Oudh.</p>
<p>Dick could not help thinking that the woman's
previous unconsciousness was assumed, for she
answered Azimoolah readily enough. Appar-
ently she was justifying herself. The talk did
not last long. Hooseinee Khanum slowly rose
and stalked haughtily away with an air which
suggested she was Azimoolah Khan's equal.</p>
<p>Azimoolah went to the door, opened it, and
stood in a deferential attitude. When Dick
Heron approached Azimoolah preceded him into
the lobby as though to give an assurance that he
need fear no foul play.</p>
<p>In the open air Dick's giddiness increased.
The reaction had set in after the prolonged
excitement. That sweetmeat? Had it con-
tained anything deleterious? He fancied Azi-
moolah looked at him inquiringly, very much as
a doctor does when he is diagnosing the condition
of a patient. Whether or not he felt that if he
rode home on horseback he would have some
difficulty in maintaining his seat in the saddle.</p>
<pb n="56"/>
<p><said>You would prefer a carriage perhaps?</said>
suggested Azimoolah.</p>
<p>Dick nodded. He was rapidly becoming worse.
He could hardly speak. Azimoolah took his arm
and walked with him to the corner of the build-
ing, in front of which was a verandah. Here a
couple of <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">chowkedahs</foreign> (watchmen) were squatting.
Azimoolah sent one man to the stables, and
remained with Dick who, almost in a state of
collapse, was leaning against the wall, his cheeks
as white as the stone.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Dick Heron was speeding
towards Cawnpore, indifferent to all things
earthly. Arrived at his bungalow, he was lifted
from the carriage by the frightened servants, and
placed on his bed looking like death itself. The
servants held a consultation. What was every-
body's business was nobody's business. They
all knew the Sahib was ill, maybe dead; but who
was to fetch the doctor?</p>
<p>Somehow the matter was settled, and an
hour afterwards a buggy stopped at the bun-
galow, and a well-set-up, business-like man
stepped out—Francis Stainton, one of the
regimental doctors.</p>

<p><said>Why don't you sit down, Phil? I never saw
such a restless fellow as you are. Does your arm
pain you?</said></p>
<p><said>Not at all, Amy. It's getting on famously,
thanks to your care and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Langridge's skill.</said></p>
<p><said>Well then, dear, I wish you wouldn't walk
about like a caged tiger. You're getting on my
nerves. What are you thinking about?</said></p>
<p><said>Young Dick and his last letter from Cawn-
pore.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, you mean the bother among the sepoys
he speaks of. I forget what it was about.</said></p>
<p><said>It doesn't matter; I wasn't thinking of that
particularly. By the way, didn't that pretty girl,
Ruth Armitage, who was staying with you two
years ago, when I was invalided home after
those terrible six months I passed in the hospital
at Varna, go to Cawnpore?</said> broke off Philip
abruptly. <said>She has an uncle or a guardian
there, so you told me.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, a Colonel Waring; but what makes you
mention her? My big brother hasn't fallen in
love, has he?</said> laughed Amy. <said>I thought you
were above such frivolities, Phil.</said></p>
<p><said>I don't how that I'm in love, and if I were,
<pb n="58"/>
I'm not sure it would be frivolity,</said> said Philip
Heron slowly.</p>
<p><said>Of course it wouldn't. You're frightfully
serious in everything, dear old Phil,</said> said his
sister, her brown eyes beaming.</p>
<p><said>Well, real fighting isn't exactly a light-
hearted business, though it's infinitely better
than what went with it in the Crimea. I fancy
the more than a taste of hardship our fellows had
there sobered a good many of them. I know it
did me.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, indeed,</said> cried Amy, with a little
shudder. <said>Thank goodness Dick won't have
such a time. At any rate I hope he won't.
The boy's so impulsive. He hasn't got your cool
head, Phil.</said></p>
<p><said>He's none the worse for being impulsive.
Upon my word, if the youngsters saw danger
ahead they might hesitate, and then their chance
of covering themselves with glory would be lost.
As you say, Dick won't have my Crimean luck,
but if anything should happen—if there be a
rumpus among the native troops, as some writers
in the newspapers seem to foreshadow—I'd like
to be with him and take my share. I'm tired of
this inaction. I want to be at hard work again.</said></p>
<p>Phil Heron—Captain Heron, late of the 11th
Hussars, to give him his full title—resumed
pacing the lawn of the pretty garden leading
down to the river. His sister watched him a
little anxiously from the hammock in which she
was idly swinging. Dick, her junior by three
years, was her favourite brother. She was fond
of Phil, but she was never in his confidence. He
<pb n="59"/>
was two years older than she, and this made all
the difference in the world. Phil had never
poured his troubles into her sympathetic ear as
Dick had many a time. Dick was never without
a flirtation on hand, even when he was at Addis-
combe, and supposed to be working hard, and
somehow this weakness made him more interest-
ing in Amy's eyes than was her reserved elder
brother, who, as far as she knew, never troubled
his head about women.</p>
<p>Phil took soldiering somewhat seriously, as,
according to his sister, he did most things, and
his bitter experience in the Crimea had not
tended to lighten his views. It was rather the
other way about. He had ridden in the Bala-
clava charge; he had been severely wounded,
fever seized him in the Varna hospital, and he
was given up as a doomed man. But somehow
he pulled through and came back to England,
declared by the doctors to be unfit for further
service. It was a bitter disappointment to him
to be told that his career as a soldier was at an
end, for he loved his profession and had looked
forward to rising to a high rank.</p>
<p>Phil returned from the Crimea in the spring
of 1855; it was now the spring of 1857, and,
thanks to a superb constitution, constant fresh
air, the assiduous care of his sister Amy, and the
rest at her pretty cottage at Teddington, he had
recovered his health and strength in a marvellous
way. He was yearning to get back to the army,
but nothing had been done. His doctor was
cautious, and for the moment refused to sanction
the step.</p>
<pb n="60"/>
<p>Captain Heron continued to walk up and
down the lawn for some five minutes; then
suddenly he stopped in front of the hammock.</p>
<p><said>Look here, Amy,</said> he burst out, <said>I'm
not going to do any more loafing. I shall run up
to town this afternoon, and see some of the
powers that be at the Horse Guards. I've got
a friend or two at court, and I ought not to have
much difficulty in getting a commission. I'd
like to have a shot at India.</said></p>
<p><said>Cawnpore?</said> said Amy, with a smile.</p>
<p><said>Not necessarily,</said> he answered, after a pause
—a pause which his sharp-eyed sister interpreted
as significant of evasion. <said>India, you see,</said>
he went on, <said>is the only place where one is
likely to see active service. We've always got
a little war on somewhere. If it isn't the
frontier, chastising what I believe are generally
called <q>insolent tribes,</q> it's helping the various
Indian races in the interior to settle their quarrels,
and so there's always something for one to do.</said></p>
<p><said>Still, it would be pleasant if you could be
sent to Cawnpore,</said> continued his sister, bent on
teasing him. <said>You'd have company in Dick,
and there'd be—Ruth Armitage.</said></p>
<p>Phil took Amy's bantering very good-humour-
edly.</p>
<p><said>Ruth, of course, would be an attraction, but
please don't forget that my object in going to
India is to fight, not to make love.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, certainly. Ruth is very pretty and very
nice: don't you think so?</said></p>
<p><said>I admit that was the impression I was under
during the short time I had the pleasure of her
<pb n="61"/>
acquaintance. She only stayed with you a
month, I fancy.</said></p>
<p><said>And that was nearly two years ago, just
after my wreck of a hero came here to get patched
up. Your memory's wonderful, Phil,</said> exclaimed
his sister, laughing. <said>My dear boy, it's no use
your pretending you're not interested in Ruth,
because you are. Perhaps you'd like to know
that she hasn't fulfilled the mission that took her
back to Colonel Waring.</said></p>
<p><said>Her mission? What was that?</said> asked
Captain Heron quickly. <said>She never told me
she had one.</said></p>
<p>The young lady in the hammock burst into
an uncontrollable fit of merriment.</p>
<p><said>Of course not. It wasn't very likely,</said> she
exclaimed, when her mirth had subsided. <said>Didn't
you know that she returned, as scores of girls do
who have friends or relatives in India, to find a
husband?</said></p>
<p><said>I don't believe it.</said></p>
<p><said>Why not? She might do worse than marry
a rich East India Company's official, especially
if he's old.</said></p>
<p><said>I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Amy,</said>
returned her brother, in a tone of reproof. <said>I
can't think you mean what you say.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, it doesn't matter what I mean—the
point is that Ruth isn't married; not even
engaged, so she told me in her last letter. I
ought to tell you I put the question to her—so
—but the subject's not of the slightest interest
to you, I'm sure.</said></p>
<p>Phil Heron made no reply. He was not in-
<pb n="62"/>
clined to agree with his sister. He had a very
vivid recollection of a pair of beseeching eyes,
of a soft, sympathetic voice, of pretty innocent
ways which fascinated without the owner intend-
ing they should. Ruth Armitage was a girl
who could, if she chose, twine herself round a
man's heart so quietly that he would not be
conscious she had done so, until he missed her
presence. And this had been Phil Heron's fate.
When Ruth said <q>good-bye</q> to him, he had
tried to steel himself to the decree of fate which
apparently ordained that they should never meet
again, but he had found the effort very difficult.
Yet he had never made love to the pretty, gentle
girl; he had only thought a good deal about her.</p>
<p>When Amy suggested that the subject of
Ruth's possible marriage was not of the slightest
interest to her brother, she threw out the words
as a feeler, but Phil was not to be drawn. Light-
ing his pipe, he sauntered to the riverside and
contemplated the sunlit ripples until the luncheon
gong sounded.</p>
<p>That afternoon he carried out his intention
of calling at the Horse Guards, but there was
no one in attendance whom he knew, and as
he was too well acquainted with the routine not
to be aware of the futility of explaining his
business to strangers, he took a stroll in <abbr>St.</abbr>
James's Park to kill time until the dinner hour. He
was approaching the bridge over the ornamental
water, when a hand smote him on the shoulder.</p>
<p><said>Phil Heron!</said> said a cheery voice.</p>
<p>He turned instantly. It was an old comrade,
a Major Walters, who had been at Addiscombe
<pb n="63"/>
with him, and afterwards in the Crimea at the
same time. Bob Walters was as staunch-
hearted a fellow as ever breathed, and was as
ready with a joke as with his purse.</p>
<p><said>Well, old fellow,</said> said he, <said>and how are
you getting on? Your fighting weight isn't
quite what it was two years ago.</said></p>
<p>Heron's eleven stone was reduced to nine,
his five-feet-nine of bone and sinew looked
somewhat weedy, and Walters playfully pinched
his arm.</p>
<p><said>You're putting on a little muscle, but I
shouldn't like to back you to cut a sheep in half
with one blow, as I've seen you do it in the old
days.</said></p>
<p><said>That will come to pass again, I dare say,
Bob,</said> Heron answered lightly. <said>What is the
latest news with you, old chap?</said></p>
<p><said>Good news. The old 101st is ordered to the
East. We start from Southampton to-morrow.</said></p>
<p><said>The East? Do you mean India?</said></p>
<p><said>No, no. There is nothing to be done in India.
All is quiet there. China, lad, is our game.</said></p>
<p><said>I wish you were going to India.</said></p>
<p><said>My dear fellow, for what purpose?</said></p>
<p><said>For no particular purpose, save that I have
been reading up Indian matters of late, and I've
got it into my head that our position there is
not so safe as we fancy it is.</said></p>
<p><said>Pooh! England has got India in the hollow
of her hand.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, it may be so. If—— but there, no
doubt you're right.</said></p>
<p>Something in Heron's tone evidently struck
<pb n="64"/>
Walters as curious. He looked at his old friend
steadfastly for a moment, and then burst into
a laugh.</p>
<p><said>What the deuce can go wrong in India?
Our fellows have thorough control over the
sepoys, and I believe the native troops would shoot
down their own countrymen, were it necessary,
and they were called upon to do it. But I must
run away. I've a host of things before me.</said></p>
<p><said>How many leave-takings?</said> asked Heron.</p>
<p><said>Not many. I thank my stars no girl will
cry her eyes out after me.</said></p>
<p><said>Still adamant?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, and likely to remain so. Good-bye,
old chap.</said></p>
<p><said>Good-bye. I envy you your luck. You'll
come back from China Colonel Walters.</said></p>
<p><said>May be or may not. Suppose a Chinese
bullet finds its way into my skull? My dead
body might figure as an idol in a joss-house.
Who knows? I'm ugly enough.</said></p>
<p><said>Get out, Bob. You're only fishing for
compliments, and you won't get one from me.</said></p>
<p>Walters laughed, and with a wave of his hand
rushed away.</p>
<p>A week or two went over. Heron had got
no further at the Horse Guards. He wrote to a
friendly official, who replied that for the moment
he was out of favour with the authorities,
and that speaking on Phil's behalf would do
more harm than good. He suggested a personal
application, and mentioned the name of an
officer who might do him some service. Not
believing much in formal applications, which
<pb n="65"/>
he knew were too often pigeon-holed, Philip
Heron resolved to stay a few days in London,
and call every day at the Horse Guards on the
off-chance of coming across the man he wanted.</p>
<p>One morning he lounged into a West End
Club, one much favoured by military men.
There was rather a large number of members
in the room for such an early hour. They were
talking eagerly, and one old gentleman—an
Indian general—was laying down the law with
great emphasis.</p>
<p><said>Mutiny!</said> <said>Barrackpore!</said> <said>An officer
shot!</said> <said>Regiments disbanded,</said> were among the
disjointed sentences which reached Heron's ears.</p>
<p>He went up to the old soldier, who had pos-
session of <title>The Times</title>, and asked him what had
happened.</p>
<p><said>Mutiny, by Gad, sir!</said> was the answer. <said>And
if I'd been General Hearsey I'd have shot
the ringleaders offhand. What's the good of
his disbanding a regiment? Something much
sterner's wanted to make an impression on those
fellows. What did we do when a mutiny broke
out in this very place, Barrackpore, in 1824?
Fired upon them with artillery, and the cause of
the outbreak was not nearly so serious as this.
It had nothing to do with their religion. We
heard no more of the mutiny. But this milk-
and-water treatment of the scoundrels I don't
like. We shall hear something more before
long: mark my words!</said></p>
<p>This old gentleman not many days before had
been one of the most obstinate in maintaining
that nothing like insubordination, much less
<pb n="66"/>
mutiny, could possibly happen in India. His
sudden change of opinion, to Phil's mind, was
ominous. Heron borrowed the paper, and read
what <title>The Times</title> correspondent had to say.</p>
<p>The affair at Barrackpore happened on
March 30, seven weeks before. There was no
telegraphic communication from England beyond
Trieste and Alexandria, and hence the time the
news took in transmission. In the case of the
outbreak at Meerut, when the horrors of the
Mutiny first began, the time was even longer.
The revolt at this station took place on
Sunday, May 10. The Bombay correspondent
of <title>The Times</title>, writing on June 9 alluded to the
news as requiring confirmation; and not till
June 27 was it actually known in England, and
that the mutineers, after the scenes of bloodshed
at Meerut, had marched upon Delhi, and re-
peated the horrors there. But not one in that
club-room on the morning of May 19 could fore-
shadow these terrible scenes. Phil Heron read
the account of the disbanding of the 19th Native
Infantry at Barrackpore, and the shooting of
Lieutenant Baugh by Mungul Pandy (from this
name all the sepoys afterwards came to be known
as <soCalled>Pandies</soCalled>) with intense interest. Before he
had reached the description of the men laying
down their arms at Barrackpore, and of a scare
at Dum-Dum sending all the Europeans hurrying
in a fright to Calcutta, about eight miles away,
he had made up his mind what to do.</p>
<p><said>General Cuthbertson,</said> said he, in a low
voice to the old officer, <said>you know the directors
of the East India Company?</said></p>
<pb n="67"/>
<p><said>Almost every one of them, from the chair-
man downwards,</said> said the general.</p>
<p><said>Give me an introduction to the director
whom you think will do most for me, I'm
anxious to be in India. I'm off the sick-list now,
and I'm ready for some hard work.</said></p>
<p>General Cuthbertson was over seventy, but the
fire of military ardour was not quite extinguished
—at any rate, something in Phil Heron's glance
rekindled the dying embers.</p>
<p><said>And, by Jove, my lad, you'll have it!</said> ex-
claimed the veteran. <said>I'll write you a letter at
once. We shall want a few thousand like you in
India before this business is over.</said></p>
<p>The blood was coursing quickly through Heron's
veins. How slow everything seemed! He al-
ready wanted to start on his journey, yet so
much had to be done.</p>
<p>He took a cab to the gaunt, grim, dreary East
India House in Leadenhall Street. Probably he
would not have seen the director but for General
Cuthbertson's introduction, for the great man
was full of business. As it was, Heron was
quickly ushered into a spacious room, where sat
a bald-headed old gentleman, with a high stand-
up collar binding each cheek, and with gold
spectacles resting on his nose.</p>
<p><said>You desire, Captain Heron, to volunteer your
services?</said> said he curtly.</p>
<p><said>Yes; I wish to depart at once. The over-
land route will, I presume, get me to Calcutta
in a little less than six weeks.</said></p>
<p><said>You are in a great hurry, young man.</said></p>
<p><said>Is there no cause for hurry just now,
<pb n="68"/>
sir? What about this morning's news from
India?</said></p>
<p><said>The newspapers exaggerate,</said> replied the
director pompously. <said>The Government of a
century is not overturned in a day. This year,
1857, is the centenary of the taking of Calcutta
by the great Clive, of the building of Fort William,
and of the victory of Plassy. It would be a strange
thing if, when we are about to erect a monument
to Clive's memory, the Empire, the foundations
of which he laid for us, should be in jeopardy.</said></p>
<p>Philip Heron was silent. It certainly did
appear to be absurd, especially as he had no
sounder arguments to advance than his own
impressions.</p>
<p><said>But we won't argue the point. I don't
blame you for being anxious over the welfare of
India. Here are some preliminary papers, which
you will read over and sign, and then I should
advise you to go to the War Office, and take
your instructions direct from the military au-
thorities. Good morning.</said></p>
<p>Phil Heron was a new man. He did not care
a jot for the director's abrupt dismissal. He
felt he was already on the way to India, that in
two months or so he should be in Cawnpore—for
it was to some regiment stationed there to which
he desired to be attached. There might have
been some difficulty in accomplishing this, for
red tape is all-powerful; but maybe the War
Office had private information, and knew that
men would be wanted, and so before long the
arrangements were made.</p>
<p>The next mail steamer left Southampton in
<pb n="69"/>
two days, and he had, consequently, not much
time for preparations. But the less luggage he
took the better; he soon got together what was
necessary, and he did not tell his sister Amy his
intention until the eve of his departure. She
heard him with sad eyes.</p>
<p><said>Aren't you very unwise to select such an
unhealthy climate in your state of health?</said> she
asked.</p>
<p>Heron shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p><said>I'm quite well, Amy,</said> said he. <said>But,
health or no health, I'm going.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, it's a great mercy there's no war in India.
I shan't cry over you as I did when you went to
the Crimea. Still, I'm puzzled. Why do you want
to go to India, and in so great a hurry, too?</said></p>
<p>Heron's sister Amy was a little, fair, blue-eyed
woman, who generally managed to get her way
in everything. Her hair brushed her brother's
chin as she put one hand on each of his shoulders
and looked into his face. She was shrewd, and
she read his countenance like a book.</p>
<p><said>You are going because Ruth Armitage is
there,</said> said she quickly.</p>
<p>Heron laughed, but his laugh was forced. He
said little more. He did not allude to the risks
to which Ruth was exposed, nor did he mention
the real object which was taking him so hastily
to India. Had he told Amy of the workings of
his mind, she would have laughed at him for a
dreamer.</p>
<p>The next morning about twelve o'clock saw
Heron at Southampton. The steamer was timed
to start at half-past one, and the last consign-
<pb n="70"/>
ment of luggage was being hastily deposited on
board. He sought out his cabin, and, as an old
campaigner—his Crimean experiences had taught
him no end of dodges—he busied himself in
arranging his goods and chattels so as to have
that handiest which was most wanted, and then
he went on deck. One of the ship's officers ap-
proached the captain just as Philip reached him.</p>
<p><said>High water, sir,</said> said he.</p>
<p>This was the signal. The <name type="vessel" rend="i">Coromandel</name> lazily
revolved her paddles, and the huge mass began
to move, but so slowly that only the gentle
vibrations seemed to indicate motion. But the
narrow outlet from the docks was drawing nearer,
and gradually the steamer was warped out.</p>
<p>At a convenient distance from the docks she
dropped anchor, there to await the coming of the
overland mail and the late passengers. A fussy
little steamer arrived alongside, and, after a
quarter of an hour of intense bustle and seem-
ingly dire confusion, all was declared to be ready,
and soon after the vessel was rapidly cleaving
Southampton Water towards the Channel.</p>
<p>It was a glorious sunset, but Philip Heron was
not in the vein to enjoy it. The setting sun
flooded the restless waves with a blood red, and
to his excited imagination there was something
ominous in the colour. Then the crimson faded
away, and the cold grey of the coming night
buried everything in an ashen-hued pall.</p>
<p>As the first was typical of the realisation of
vengeance, of the lust for blood, of seething
hate, and ungovernable passions, so the second
suggested an abyss of gloom and despair.</p>

<p>While <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stainton with grave face was sitting
by Dick's bed, puzzled by symptoms in the
young man's stupor which he had a difficulty
in diagnosing, a very different scene was being
enacted in the palace at Bithoor. Nana Sahib,
like Dick Heron, was also lying prostrate. Indo-
lence, sensuality, self-indulgence, pampered vanity
were written in his pallid, unwholesome-looking,
puffy cheeks, his dull, sleepy eyes, his limp mouth.</p>

<p>The Maharajah was embedded in soft cushions.
Reclining by his side was Adala, his favourite
dancing-girl. Azimoolah Khan was sitting cross-
legged in front, his alert, wily face presenting a
strong contrast to that of the gross voluptuary,
who, with drooping eyelids, had been listening
languidly to Azimoolah's story, how Dick Heron
had been lured into the palace, and how the
scheme of influencing him through the arts of
Hooseinee Khanum had failed.</p>
<p><said>Hooseinee is too old,</said> said the Nana with
a yawn.</p>
<p><said>Adala would have done better, but she
would not consent,</said> returned the Mahomedan,
shrugging his shoulders, <said>and had she con-
sented Your Highness would have been angry.</said></p>
<pb n="72"/>
<p><said>Adala is mine. Have I not spent a king's
ransom upon her?</said> said the Nana, turning his
fishy eyes on the girl. <said>Have I spoken truly,
Adala?</said></p>
<p>The girl bent her head low, and lifting the
hem of the Nana's robe, she raised it to her lips.</p>
<p>Azimoolah Khan watched the proceeding
with a sneer. He knew well enough that Adala
was no better than the rest of the army of para-
sites, fawning on the Maharajah, for what they
could squeeze out of him.</p>
<p><said>Send for Hooseinee Khanum. I would
question her,</said> said the Nana presently.</p>
<p>The woman was summoned. She marched in
defiantly, and salaamed in the usual fashion, but
there was contempt in the gesture. The Nana
inspired no respect.</p>
<p><said>You boast of your arts, Hooseinee,</said> said he.
<said>Why did you not conquer the Englishman?</said></p>
<p><said>How do I know? Englishmen are not like
our race. They are cold, bloodless.</said></p>
<p><said>You gave him sweetmeats?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes.</said></p>
<p><said>And he ate?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, he ate. He was angry with me. It
was Adala he expected to see. We quarrelled.
He flung me to the ground. He hates me.</said></p>
<p><said>And you, Hooseinee?</said></p>
<p><said>I hate him.</said></p>
<p><said>That is well,</said> drawled the Nana, after a
pause. <said>You may go. You are not to blame.</said></p>
<p>The woman salaamed and departed. The
Maharajah sank into the silken cushions, ex-
hausted by the call his questioning had made
<pb n="73"/>
upon his brain. Azimoolah waited a few minutes
for his master to recover himself, and went on:</p>
<p><said>My lord sees now that his servant was right.
I have told you the truth. What could Hooseinee
Khanum have fooled the young Englishman
into telling? He has no secrets. You could
have heard no more from him than you knew
already. The time has come to strike. Why
do you delay?</said></p>
<p><said>I would like to be certain. You say there
are but few Englishmen left in their own country.
Do you swear that is the truth?</said></p>
<p><said>I swear by Allah it is so. The English have
no soldiers but those in India. The bones of the
rest are whitening in the land of the Russians.
Gold and blood have been wasted in the Crimea.
England has been stabbed to the heart. She
is crippled. Has not England treated you with
injustice? Has she not robbed you of your
rights, and trampled upon the laws of our
fathers? I pleaded in vain for you in London.
The Company refused to listen to my prayer.
There is nothing left for you but revenge. Never
was there a more fitting time for vengeance than
now. It is the will of Allah, and with his help
we will sweep our land free of the accursed
dogs!</said></p>
<p>The Mahomedan in his excitement had
sprung to his feet, and with his long arms waving
and his slim body slightly arched, he was not
unlike a bird of evil omen. His voice was no
longer soft and silky, but harsh and guttural.</p>
<p>Azimoolah's vehemence, so unusual in one
who had such complete command over himself,
<pb n="74"/>
the sinister light in his eyes, roused the flaccid
nerves of the Maharajah, like the lash of a whip.
But he was not entirely convinced.</p>
<p><said>That may be so, Azimoolah Khan,</said> said he
in a wavering tone, <said>but Captain Howar Ken-
drith has said differently.</said></p>
<p>By Howar Kendrith the Nana meant Howard
Kendrick. The natives of India have a peculiar
faculty in the alteration of the names of Euro-
peans to suit their own methods of pronuncia-
tion. Azimoolah Khan was an exception. He
had passed a considerable time in England; he
had a gift for acquiring languages, and he had
conquered the difficulties of English speech.</p>
<p><said>And what has Captain Howard Kendrick
said?</said> asked Azimoolah scornfully.</p>
<p><said>That there are thousands of soldiers in
England; that they have many ships and much
treasure. The English will never let our people
go,</said> cried the Nana, with something like energy,
so much so that Adala thought it necessary to
wave her fan of peacocks' feathers about his
face.</p>
<p><said>Howard Kendrick is a liar. Did he not a
year ago promise to intercede on your behalf
with his father, the director of the Company?
What has come of it? Nothing. Yet you have
loaded him with rupees. How much of your
money has he not thrown away on horse racing,
on cards, on women?</said></p>
<p>It was true. Howard Kendrick had been
particularly friendly with the Nana, had made
the adopted son of Bajee Rao believe he could
do great things, and he had dipped freely into
<pb n="75"/>
the Nana's purse, but with no result, and latterly
the Nana had received him coldly.</p>
<p>The reason Kendrick had given that very
day why he would not be present at the officers'
mess was false. He had no intention of buying
a horse, and his journey was not for that pur-
pose, but to borrow money from the Maharajah.
He had ridden to the palace, and to his disgust
had been refused an audience. The refusal was
couched in the most respectful terms, and accom-
panied by profuse apologies, but Kendrick was
not deceived. He rode away in a towering pas-
sion, for he had set his heart upon obtaining a sum
large enough, not only to pay the most pressing
of his debts, but also to be in a position to dazzle
Ruth Armitage with an idea of his wealth.</p>
<p>Azimoolah saw that his arguments were having
weight with the credulous Maharajah, and he
pushed home his advantage.</p>
<p><said>I have news for your lordship—great news,</said>
said he, going back to his tone of insinuating con-
fidence. <said>I had deferred it until you had seen
for yourself that Hooseinee Khanum could do
nothing. The 19th regiment at Barrackpore
has, as you already know, begun to show the way.
The English think by disarming and disbanding
they have removed the danger. We know
differently. Some of the 19th are now in the
lines at Cawnpore. These men are Brahmins;
they have talked to others of their own caste
here; they have told of things which have hap-
pened at Barrackpore, of the insults to their
sacred religion, of the more insults to come.
The chupatty is passing from hand to hand;
<pb n="76"/>
the people are already saying among themselves
<q xml:lang="hi">Sub lal hoga hi</q> (everything is to become red).
We are ready. We are only waiting your lord-
ship's commands. The astrologers everywhere
are prophesying that this year, the hundredth
from the battle of Plassy, will see the end of the
red coats. And you, my lord, will be at Delhi,
uncountable riches at your feet, the omnipotent
ruler of this mighty land, freed from the vultures
of John Company, freed from the bayonets of
England. You have seen the English maidens
here. They are more beautiful than the girls
of Cashmere. They can be made to love our
race. Have I not told you of the ladies of Bel-
gravia, of Mayfair—every word is true. You
have seen their letters to me when I was in
London. And you, yourself, Maharajah, do
you not admire the English rose of Cawnpore
—Ruth Armitage?</said></p>
<p><said>I must have time, Azimoolah, to think over
this,</said> interposed the Nana, much disturbed.
<said>The English are strong. I must be sure that
others are with us before I act. When I do so,
there will be no going back. Have I not sworn
that my wrongs can be righted only in blood?
Not a man, not a woman, not a child shall escape.
My vengeance shall be complete when the time
comes. Leave me, Azimoolah, to my thoughts.
Adala, summon the musicians.</said></p>
<p>Azimoolah salaamed low. He knew thor-
oughly the man with whom he was dealing. He
had but to excite the Nana's cupidity, his vanity,
his passions, his lust for blood. He had laid the
train, now let the fuse smoulder.</p>
<pb n="77"/>
<p>For the next hour the Nana permitted himself
to be amused by his <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">nautch</foreign> girls, headed by
Adala, all of them beautiful, with soft, dark eyes
and flowing raven hair. They sang as they
danced to the dreamy monotones of stringed
instruments; some of them played by a bow,
others with the fingers. The bangles on their
wrists and ankles jingled, the bells on their
ornaments tinkled in time with the music;
they glided, they twined their bodies, they curved
their arms, each movement of the dance having
its meaning—love, hope, jealousy, hatred,
defiance. From their figures was wafted a
perfume; sweet-scented flowers were inter-
twined with their hair, their jewels were daz-
zling, their raiment gorgeous.</p>
<p>The dance, alternately soothing and exciting,
failed to help the Maharajah to make up his
mind; it simply lulled him into a state of
voluptuous stupor. In imagination he saw
himself at Delhi, living very much the life of
Shah Alum, the old Mogul Emperor, who came
under the protection of the British in 1803, when
Lord Lake obtained possession of the city of
Delhi. The Palace of Delhi at that time was a
centre of sensuality and crime. One who wrote
with knowledge, obtained at first hand, describes
how wrestlers, jesters, dancing-girls, musicians,
forgers, swindlers, thieves, receivers of stolen
property, distillers of spirits, compounders of
sweetmeats and opium, all formed a part of
the palace community.</p>
<p>Sensual intrigue was rife. Wives intrigued
against wives, mothers against sons, men and
<pb n="78"/>
women scoured the country far and wide for
beautiful girls to sell as slaves within the palace.
In such a hotbed of villainy any conspiracy was
possible. Assassinations were frequent, and the
silent river was close at hand to bear away all
traces of the victim. The Bithoor palace was
not so steeped in vice as that of Delhi, but in its
hidden recesses it ran it very close.</p>
<p>The languorous dance ended, the twanging
and scraping of the instruments ceased. His
Highness was in the mood for sleep. His heavy
eyelids drooped; dreams of the revenge over
which in the waking hours of the day he was
continually pondering, succeeded to his visions
of self-indulgence and unbounded wealth.</p>
<p>Revenge was rarely absent from the Nana's
thoughts. The men of the hated race whom he
entertained so sumptuously, the women be
smiled upon and loaded with costly presents,
saw nothing in him but the harmless victim of
pleasure. How they would have been unde-
ceived could they have penetrated his actual
thoughts!</p>
<p>The fat, lazy sensualist's hatred of England
was actuated by motives as base as his own nature.
The Nana was, as already mentioned, the eldest
son, by adoption, of Bajee Rao, the last of the
Mahratta kings. By the Hindoo <foreign xml:lang="hi">Shasters</foreign>, or
scriptures, there is a fearful doom awarded to
those who die childless; and in order to avert a
terrible fate, the system of adoption <q>when
natural issue fails,</q> is permitted. Seereek
Dhoondoo Punth, who, some say, was the son of
a Poonah corn merchant, while others assert his
<pb n="79"/>
father was a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">ryot</foreign> living in an obscure village near
Bombay, was given the rights and privileges of
a naturally born heir. Bajee Rao died in 1851,
and Dhoondoo Punth inherited all the landed
property, houses, and jewels of the deposed king.
But this did not content the rapacious Dhoondoo;
he wanted also Bajee Rao's pension of £80,000,
which Lord Dalhousie had stopped. Dhoondoo
sent a memorial to the Governor of the North
West Province, and this being unsuccessful, he
dispatched Azimoolah Khan to England to plead
his cause with the East India Company and the
Government.</p>
<p>Azimoolah, who had risen from the position
of a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign> to that of a teacher in the
Government School in Cawnpore, was a man of
considerable attainments and inordinate ambi-
tion. He could speak English and French; his
manners were polished, and in London fashion-
able ladies swarmed round him. Successful as
he was in society, he failed both with the Com-
pany and the Government. Disappointed and
enraged, he returned to Cawnpore with a tale
that his non-success was due to the Company
bribing the English Government.</p>
<p>The lie would not have mattered much; what
did matter was his belief that the power of
England was broken. This belief was based on
what he had seen and heard in Constantinople,
through which city he had come on his journey
home. In Constantinople, at that time, it was
the opinion that the English army would meet
its fate in the Crimea as the French army half a
century before had at Moscow. It was Azi-
<pb n="80"/>
moolah's object to possess the Nana also with
this belief. The crafty Mahomedan knew if he
could set up the puppet Nana as ruler of India
that unlimited gold would roll into the pockets of
his prime minister. Hence he was untiring in
his insidious counsels. The Nana's rights had
been ignored by these dogs of Englishmen.
Vengeance should be his.</p>
<p>When would the time of vengeance come?
That was the question the Maharajah was im-
patient to solve. If he could only be sure that
Azimoolah spoke the truth when he said the
power of England was crippled! At that very
moment the crafty mind of Azimoolah Khan,
whose craving for revenge was more intense and
deadly than that of his master, was planning
how he could spur the indolent Nana up to the
striking point. <choice><corr>Hooseinee</corr><orig>Hoosainee</orig></choice> Khanum had failed
with Dick Heron; some other plan must be
tried; some other Englishman selected. Azi-
moolah fixed upon Howard Kendrick for his
next attempt.</p>

<p>In total ignorance of the hideous plotting of the
Nana and his lieutenant, and blind to the signs
of the gathering storm, life in Cawnpore went on
very much as usual. The chief amusement was
the retailing of scandal, and for some little time
the most important piece of gossip was the strange
illness of Lieutenant Dick Heron. For a whole
day he had been unconscious; then followed a
species of delirious fever, which lasted almost a
week, and when his wandering senses returned
he was unable to give any explanation how he
had been attacked or where he had been. <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Stainton was certain he had taken a drug of
some kind, not necessarily a poison, but of what
nature could not be determined.</p>
<p>Another piece of gossip was the rumour that
clamorous demands were being made upon
Howard Kendrick by his many creditors, and that
if he could not satisfy them within a week
something would have to be done. What some
of these creditors feared was that he would ex-
change into another regiment, and that they
would have to whistle for their money. His
influence, thanks to his father being a director
of the East India Company, would do for him
<pb n="82"/>
what others less advantageously placed might
sigh for in vain. It was true that the father,
tired of his son's extravagance and dissipation,
had refused to pay any more of his debts; but
though Sir Oliver Kendrick might refuse to part
with money he might help his son in other ways.</p>
<p>Two days after Dick's attack, Howard Ken-
drick was sitting in his bungalow smoking, sipping
brandy-and-soda, and scowling—especially scowl-
ing. He had not overcome his disappointment
at his failure to see the Nana, nor was he likely
to forget it. Unable to pay his debts of honour,
he had had the salt rubbed in pretty thickly on
the parade, on the racecourse and in the mess-
room. Virtually he had been sent to Coventry.</p>
<p>The thing was the more galling because Dick
Heron being practically <foreign xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</foreign>, Kendrick
had the field all to himself, so far as Ruth
Armitage was concerned. He dared not put in
an appearance at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring's while the cloud
was hanging over him, because the Colonel was
bound to know his position, and maybe, had
said something both to his wife and to Ruth
about his being under a cloud.</p>
<p><said>A cursed nuisance,</said> he muttered, as he
knocked off the ash from his cigar. <said>If I write
to the pater it'll take months before I have his
reply, and then it may be unfavourable. It's
no use going to the bank: I've already over-
drawn my account pretty heavily, and dashed
if I know any fellow who'd lend me even a fiver
—not that a fiver would be of much use. Beastly
nuisance. I shan't forget in a hurry how the
chaps at loo last night in the club card-room
<pb n="83"/>
froze when they saw me coming. A month ago
I was sure of a ten-pound note any night.</said></p>
<p>This was quite true. Kendrick's luck at all
forms of card gambling was phenomenal. Some
of his comrades had their doubts as to whether
luck was entirely the cause of his success.</p>
<p>His cigar had gone out while he was cogitating,
and, flinging it away with an oath, he lighted
another, and was drawing the first whiff when
a servant entered and announced the arrival of
a visitor—Azimoolah Khan.</p>
<p>Kendrick's scowl deepened. The sight of Azi-
moolah Khan reminded him of his rebuff at the
palace, and he did not take the trouble to rise
when the Nana's treasurer entered, nor did he
acknowledge the man's entrance in any way.
He simply stared coldly at the visitor.</p>
<p>Azimoolah, in spite of the important position
he held in the Maharajah's household, was
treated with scant respect by the English offi-
cers. Apart from the fact that the sepoys and
the natives in general were regarded slightingly,
and called niggers, a term which Trevelyan tells
us made its first appearance in decent society
during the years which immediately preceded the
Mutiny—Azimoolah was looked at askance be-
cause of his low birth, and because every one
knew he was an adventurer.</p>
<p>Very few in Cawnpore knew of his prowess in
London fashionable society, and those who did
were only the more contemptuous in their de-
meanour towards him. Of these, one was
Howard Kendrick. He had heard of Azimoolah's
exploits, through his father, the Company
<pb n="84"/>
director, but it suited his purposes to keep his
knowledge to himself. He had an idea the ex-
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign> might be useful in helping him to
fleece the Nana.</p>
<p>Azimoolah took no notice of Kendrick's rude-
ness. He bowed obsequiously, and did not
presume to take a seat.</p>
<p><said>The Maharajah has sent me to apologise to
you, Captain Kendrick, and to express his regret
he was unable to give himself the pleasure of re-
ceiving you when you did him the honour to call.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh,</said> said Kendrick gruffly, <said>I've had enough
of your master's apologies. I don't think I want
any more. If that's the only object in your
coming to see me you needn't have wasted your
time and mine.</said></p>
<p><said>I entreat you not to be angry with your
servant. I quite admit that you are justified in
feeling resentment towards the Maharajah, but
if you will be good enough to extend to me the
privilege of a few minutes' conversation, I think
I can convince you that your time will not have
been wasted. I am under many obligations to
you, Captain Kendrick, and I wish to show you
my appreciation of your kindness, and in a very
material way.</said></p>
<p><said aloud="false">What does that mean, you wily scoundrel?</said>
Kendrick asked himself. <said aloud="false">Have you come to
offer me a loan now that the fat, greasy Nana has
dried up? After all, you <emph>do</emph> owe me something.
I might have damned you out of every set here
if I'd opened my mouth. I could have made a
few good stories out of the <soCalled><foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">Khitmutgar</foreign> Prince</soCalled>
and his doings.</said></p>
<pb n="85"/>
<p><said>Sit down,</said> be growled aloud, <said>and say what
you have to say.</said></p>
<p>Azimoolah obeyed, arranging his limbs with
the ease of a European, in what is an uncom-
fortable position for the Oriental, unaccustomed
to chairs.</p>
<p><said>If I might crave permission to make a
suggestion to Captain Kendrick, who must be a
much more skilful diplomatist than a poor
ignorant man like myself can ever hope to be, I
would venture to say, as one knowing intimately
the weaknesses and vanity of the Maharajah,
that the way to make him a generous friend is
to gratify those weaknesses and flatter that
vanity. Do I make myself understood to your
lordship?</said></p>
<p><said>Hanged if you do? Do you mean that I'm
to go cap in hand and bow and scrape to the
Nana?</said></p>
<p><said>Heaven forbid,</said> rejoined Azimoolah, almost
indignant at the insinuation. <said>Permit me to
explain. I need not remind you that the
Maharajah is smarting under a sense of having
been unfairly treated by the Company and by
the English Government. To Englishmen per-
sonally he is much attached. He admires them;
he has given innumerable proofs of his friendship
to the English residents in Cawnpore, and I
fancy I am right in saying that you yourself
could bear witness to that.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, as you chaps go the Nana's not a bad
fellow. I never said he was. The best thing
about him is the way he's adapted himself to
English customs and tastes. He's as good a
<pb n="86"/>
hand with a billiard cue as any of us; though
he doesn't play as nice a game as be used, and
I told him so the last time we had a hundred up.
He's put on too much flesh.</said></p>
<p><said>You are perfectly right,</said> rejoined Azimoolah
regretfully. <said>I only wish you had more oppor-
tunities of giving the Maharajah the benefit of
your counsel. It is really with some such object
that I have taken the liberty of calling on
now. The Maharajah would like to see you
again, I know. What happened the other day
was not his fault, but was due to the stupid
blundering of a servant who misunderstood
his orders, and who has since been severely
punished.</said></p>
<p>Kendrick heard all this with secret satisfac-
tion. At the same time, knowing as he did
something of the ways of the natives, and that
they never acted without a motive, he wondered
what was coming.</p>
<p><said>That's right enough; but it was dashed
annoying all the same,</said> said he.</p>
<p><said>The Maharajah is quite of your opinion.
He would like to see you, and not only tender
his apologies in person, but proffer you some
practical compensation,</said> rejoined Azimoolah,
drooping his eyes, but without ceasing to watch
the effect of his words on the young officer.</p>
<p>Nothing could please Kendrick more. Said he
condescendingly:</p>
<p><said>I don't bear any malice, but I don't intend
to call on him again without a written invita-
tion.</said></p>
<p><said>And that you will have. Pardon me for
<pb n="87"/>
approaching a matter, which I desire to allude
to with the greatest delicacy and respect. You
are so lavish and open-handed, that it is not
wonderful your good heart should sometimes
land you into embarrassments. Now, I happen
to how that the Maharajah is desirous of placing
a sum of money at your disposal, and I feel
certain that sum would be considerably larger
if your lordship chose to amuse yourself in
the way I suggested—I mean flattering the
Maharajah's vanity.</said></p>
<p>Again Azimoolah drooped his eyelids as if
apologising for his temerity. Kendrick saw he
was approaching the object of his visit.</p>
<p><said>How?</said> he asked haughtily. <said>Can't you
come to the point?</said></p>
<p><said>I am grateful to you for the suggestion. I
will do so. The Maharajah nurses the absurd
misapprehension that England is not only
staggering under the blow inflicted by the
Russian war, but that the maintenance of her
rule in India is a heavy drain on her military
resources; in a word, that she cannot spare
another man to strengthen her power here.
The Maharajah's advisers know that the con-
trary is the case. I who have been in England
have told him so, but he is difficult to convince.
His notions are childish, and no one agrees with
them. But what are we to do with such a
nature? His craze is a harmless one, and we
have to humour him. Those who do so benefit
greatly.</said></p>
<p>Azimoolah suddenly raised his eyes. Ken-
drick read the meaning of his glance. It had a
<pb n="88"/>
personal application. But he said nothing. He
waited for the explanation, which he knew
he could not hurry by showing impatience.
The native of the East is either savagely direct
in his methods or tediously roundabout.</p>
<p>The explanation came. Azimoolah cautiously
suggested that if Kendrick would condescend to
play down to the Nana's foible as to the gradual
weakening of England it would be enormously
to his advantage. Had not his lordship, Azi-
moolah asked with extreme deference, hitherto
laughed at the Maharajah's ideas on the sub-
ject?</p>
<p><said>Why, of course; who wouldn't?</said> retorted
Kendrick with a jeer.</p>
<p><said>Quite so. Your lordship is right. In Eng-
land I learned a proverb. It might have been
written by one of our race. It runs, <q>Answer a
fool according to his folly.</q> I have no more to
say. I thank your lordship for the favour he has
bestowed upon his servant in deigning to listen
to him. The Maharajah will send his invitation.</said></p>
<p>Bowing more in Eastern than in European
fashion, Azimoolah took his departure.</p>
<p><said>Beastly disgusting to have to kotow to a
gross debauchee,</said> muttered Kendrick; <said>but it
might be worth while to agree with the vain fool
that England is going to the dogs. After all,
it's only what I've heard scores of old asses
stiffened with English pipeclay say of the Ser-
vice. Beggars can't afford to be choosers.</said></p>
<p>That evening the Nana's invitation, couched
in abjectly courteous terms, reached Howard
Kendrick. He accepted it.</p>
<pb n="89"/>
<p>Within a week after his interview with the
Nana, Kendrick had settled his debts of honour.
To explain his possession of funds, he hinted that
he had made it up with his <q>governor</q> some
time ago, but until now had thought it well to
keep his mouth shut. <said>The old boy has proved
himself a trump,</said> said Kendrick lightly to his
friends, <said>and there's no necessity for any further
secrecy. Of course, I've promised to run straight
for the future, and I'm going to keep my word.</said></p>
<p>He uttered these words for a purpose—he
knew they would reach Colonel Waring's ears, and
he wanted them to pave the way to enable him to
<soCalled>make the running,</soCalled> for winning Ruth Armitage,
while Dick Heron was lying helplessly on his back.
Two days after, Kendrick was back in his old set,
and things were apparently going well with him,
though he had not yet ventured to approach Ruth.</p>
<p>Jack Hurst in the meantime had returned
from Benares with dispatches and what news
he could pick up. It was now nearing the end
of April, and Hurst reported that on the 8th
Mungul Pandy, the private of the 34th who,
under the influence of <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">bhang</foreign> and religious
fanaticism, had run amok and had incited his
comrades to rebellion, had been hanged at
Barrackpore after being condemned by court-
martial. No further outward trouble had fol-
lowed the disbanding of the 34th and 19th, but
the contagion of discontent was spreading, and
in a very mysterious way. It was not confined
to the sepoys, but had reached the domestic
servants, many of whom had actually insulted
their employers.</p>
<pb n="90"/>
<p>Meanwhile the distribution of chupatties, inno-
cent-looking flat cakes of salt and dough, was
going on from hand to hand in every village and
hamlet with increased activity. No Englishman
knew exactly what the chupatty signified, and
the natives were little wiser. All that could be
learned was that men would do well to keep
themselves prepared, as something was about to
happen.</p>
<p>According to Hurst's information, this increased
activity dated to about a week before his return
to Cawnpore. Was it of sinister coincidence
that this date should approximately agree with
that of Kendrick's visit to the Nana?</p>

<head type="main">The Heart of an English Girl</head>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring was not holding a reception this
suffocating evening. She always found the hot
season very trying to her nerves, and feeling
unequal to the strain of entertaining her friends
she had sent out cards cancelling the func-
tion. Looking more fragile than ever, she was
lying on a couch within range of the current
of air created by the punkah; but the relief
afforded by the cumbrous apparatus did not
suffice, and Ruth in a bamboo rocking-chair
was fanning the lady's sallow face.</p>
<p><said>That'll do, dear,</said> said she in a querulous
tone. <said>The constant movement of your fan
makes me quite giddy. I wish I could go to
sleep, but with the punkah's horrid creak, creak,
it's impossible.</said></p>
<p>Ruth, without a word, closed the fan, and sat
swaying herself gently. She was used to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Waring's attacks of <soCalled>vapours.</soCalled> Fifteen years
ago <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring, then Miss Bosanquet, was the
beauty of Allahabad, where at that time Colonel
Waring was stationed. She had come out from
England to marry, and she succeeded in capturing
the Colonel. He was five-and-twenty years
older than she, but disparity in age is no obstacle
<pb n="92"/>
in India to marriage. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring's beauty
was not of the type which wears well, and there
was now not much left of the good looks which
made her the belle of the station.</p>
<p><said>I'm half sorry I put off those people,</said> she
went on after a pause. <said>Excitement always
does me good. I feel horribly washed out. I
want a change badly. I shall talk to the Colonel
about going to the Hills. Being so near the
Ganges makes Cawnpore frightfully enervating
and unhealthy. Besides, the place is fearfully
monotonous. I suppose the men don't feel it
as we do. They've plenty of occupation, what
with their duties and their racing, pig-sticking,
billiards, cards, and all that sort of thing. But
even they must get tired of doing practically
nothing, and I'm not surprised that some of
them drink and gamble.</said></p>
<p><said>It's a great pity,</said> said Ruth absently. She
was not particularly interested in what <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Waring was saying. She had heard the lady
express much the same sentiments many times
before. Besides, her thoughts were thousands
of miles away—in England.</p>
<p><said>By the way, talking of men who drink and
gamble,</said> went on <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring, with a little
more animation, <said>have you heard that Captain
Kendrick has made it up with his father?</said></p>
<p><said>Has he?</said> rejoined the girl in the same
abstracted way.</p>
<p><said>Yes. It's said Kendrick's turned over a new
leaf. It's very wise of him. Sir Oliver Kendrick's
a millionaire, and if he behaves himself, Howard
will come into all his father's money. The best
<pb n="93"/>
thing he can do is to marry and settle down.
Have you ever thought about him, Ruth?</said></p>
<p><said>In what way?</said></p>
<p><said>My dear,</said> exclaimed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring pettishly,
<said>there's only one way a woman in India ever
thinks about a man—as a possible husband;
that is if he's free to marry?</said></p>
<p><said>I'm an exception to the rule, I suppose. It's
never occurred to me to think about men in that
light.</said></p>
<p><said>Girls always talk like that, of course. What
I should be glad to know from you, is what other
prospects you have other than marrying?</said></p>
<p>Ruth could make no reply to this vital ques-
tion. She knew very well that the small sum
left her by her father had been dipped into
pretty freely by the expenses of her education
in England. The remainder would last but a
very few years. Colonel Waring was thinking
of retiring and leaving India. She could hardly
expect to burden herself upon him then.</p>
<p>Matchmaking was <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring's delight, and
she really wanted to see Ruth marry well. She
showed her interest in the subject by a little
energy. She shifted her position, and, leaning
on her elbow, she looked searchingly at the girl.</p>
<p><said>I've reason to know that a very slight en-
couragement from you would bring a proposal
from Captain Kendrick,</said> said she smilingly.</p>
<p><said>If it depends upon me, he'll never have that
encouragement,</said> said Ruth hastily. <said>I don't
want to marry a drunkard and a gambler.
Didn't you yourself, not so very long ago, warn
me against him?</said></p>
<pb n="94"/>
<p><said>Oh, that was when he had quarrelled with
his father, and his prospects were worth nothing
at all. It's quite different now. He can't be
so bad, as some make out, because the instant he
received a remittance from Sir Oliver—as a sort
of sign, I suppose, that peace was proclaimed—
he set about paying his debts. A reformed rake,
you know, often makes the best husband.</said></p>
<p><said>And the task of reformation generally falls
to the lot of the wife. No, thank you. I don't
care to undertake such a responsibility.</said></p>
<p><said>Really your notions, Ruth, are ridiculous,</said>
retorted <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring, a little angrily. <said>The
love of a good wife alone has its effect.</said></p>
<p><said>I don't deny it, but——</said></p>
<p>Ruth finished the sentence with a shrug of
her round shoulders. The impatient gesture
had its meaning, which the experienced lady
on the couch had no difficulty in interpreting
correctly.</p>
<p><said>I hope you're not going to be silly. If you
throw yourself away on some penniless young
man, you'll speedily repent it. To begin with,
you'll spoil his chances of promotion. Married
men in the army without means are frightfully
handicapped. I suppose your head's full of
Lieutenant Heron——</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring,</said> interrupted Ruth, her
cheeks scarlet. <said>You've no right to say such
a thing. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Heron is nothing to me.</said></p>
<p><said>I'm very glad to hear it. He seems to be on
the downward path, if all's true that's said about
him. You remember what Captain Kendrick
told us—that affair at the Nana's, I mean.</said></p>
<pb n="95"/>
<p><said>Of course I remember, and I thought Captain
Kendrick showed very bad taste in telling tales
against a comrade,</said> cried Ruth indignantly.
<said>I've no doubt Howard Kendrick was as bad as
—as—<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Heron. Perhaps worse.</said></p>
<p><said>That's nothing to do with it; besides,
there's a great difference between the two.
Howard Kendrick's the son of a wealthy man,
and young Heron has little more than his pay.
What is a trifle to one who's rich is often very
awkward and damaging to one who's not.
Captain Kendrick may have exaggerated, but
it's clear his story had some foundation. Lieu-
tenant Heron's illness looks very queer. It's
rumoured that he got into some disgraceful
squabble, and brought the attack upon himself.
But we needn't waste time over young Heron.
I want you to think seriously about your own
position. It would be nice if something could be
settled before I went away. You understand
what I mean, don't you?</said></p>
<p>Ruth understood perfectly well. She had
been painfully conscious for some time past
that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring regarded her with unfavourable
eyes, and for more than one reason. The
principal perhaps was that her youth, beauty,
and freshness made the Colonel's wife look older
and more faded. Naturally men were attracted
by Ruth, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring no longer held un-
disputed sway in her little court. Then there
was the evident partiality the Colonel showed
towards the daughter of his old comrade. It
might be going too far to say that his wife was
jealous of the girl, but she certainly did not like
<pb n="96"/>
her husband spending so much money on Ruth's
dress and finery. It was also clear that when
Colonel Waring retired on his pension, he would
have to be economical, and the lady considered
that any spare cash he had should be hers.
Probably most married ladies would support
these views.</p>
<p>Ruth would have been blind and deaf not to
be perfectly aware of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring's growing
hostility towards her, for the lady did not often
let slip an opportunity of making known her
sentiments. Moreover, it was perfectly clear to
the girl that her only chance of independence
was in marriage. She had had two offers since
she had been in Cawnpore from men holding
good positions in the Civil Service, and had
refused both. Half a dozen officers of various
ranks were ready to fall in love with her, but she
kept them at arm's length. So far as the im-
pecunious ones were concerned, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring
had been exceedingly helpful. The lady knew
how to deal with would-be suitors who were
ineligible.</p>
<p>As <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring said, it was all-important that
the question of her future should be settled.
Had she had friends in England, Ruth might
have solved the difficulty by returning to the old
country. But she knew very few people—Amy
Heron perhaps was the one of all her English
friends with whom she had most acquaintance.
She certainly liked Amy best, but she had a
reason for not seeking Amy's assistance, and that
reason was not wholly unconnected with her
abstraction of mind a few minutes before.</p>
<pb n="97"/>
<p>When Ruth blushed at the mention of Dick
Heron's name, it was not on account of Dick,
but of his brother Philip. Phil had, without
knowing it, won her heart. She had woven
many a web of girlish fancy about the handsome
hussar, who was doubly interesting to her, by
reason of his share in the famous Balaclava
charge, and the wound he had received. Per-
haps it was because she knew how futile were
those fancies, that she thought the more
about him. Her love belonged purely to her
imagination, but it was none the less sweet and
enduring on that account.</p>
<p>So it came about that when she met Dick
Heron she was drawn towards him for his brother's
sake. She liked Dick immensely, but directly
the impulsive lad showed symptoms of a feeling
stronger than mere friendship, she unmercifully
snubbed him. Of course the poor boy could not
understand the girl's waywardness—how should
he?—and he fancied he had offended her in some
way.</p>
<p>The turn the conversation with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring
had taken and the lady's unexpected champion-
ship of Howard Kendrick, had plunged Ruth into
a perturbation of heart and mind, which for the
moment made her silent. She wanted to have
time to realise everything fairly, but she was not
given the chance.</p>
<p><said>Well, you don't say anything,</said> broke in
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring upon Ruth's reverie impatiently.
<said>You can't accuse me of not having furthered
your interests in every way. I might have per-
suaded you to look favourably on Howard
<pb n="98"/>
Kendrick, but I didn't do so when his reputation
was not over good, and when apparently his
father had cast him off, but things having
changed, there's no earthly reason why——</said></p>
<p>A white-robed servant at this moment entered
salaaming obsequiously. He held a card in his
hand which he handed to his mistress.</p>
<p><said>The very man we were talking about—
Howard Kendrick,</said> cried <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring excitedly.
<said>How fortunate. Really, it seems as if it was
to be. My dear Ruth, now's your opportunity.
I'm sure he's come to see you, and not myself.</said></p>
<p>The lady forgot her nerves, and hastily rose
from the couch. Ruth would have quitted the
room, but <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring was between her and the
door, and there was also the possibility of her
encountering Howard Kendrick. Whatever
chance she had of escape was speedily gone, for
Kendrick had entered, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring had greeted
him effusively, and he was expressing a hope
that her indisposition would soon disappear.</p>
<p><said>Oh, it's only one of my nervous headaches—
nothing very serious, but it makes me rather a
dull companion. Ruth must make up for my
shortcomings. My dear, do your best to enter-
tain Captain Kendrick while I get Davis to bathe
my forehead with eau-de-Cologne.</said></p>
<p>And to Ruth's dismay <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring whisked
out of the room with much rustling of her ample
skirt, and the girl was left alone with the visitor.</p>
<p><said>I may at least congratulate you, Miss
Armitage, on standing this beastly climate so
well,</said> said Kendrick, retaining the hand she
had, out of mere politeness, held out to him.</p>
<pb n="99"/>
<p><said>I suppose it is because I'm in my native air,</said>
said she. <said>I was born in India.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, so I've heard. I don't know whether
to envy you or offer my sympathy. For myself,
I hate the place, and I shan't rest till I persuade
my father to let me sell my commission and get
out of it.</said></p>
<p><said>You don't like a military life, then,</said> said
Ruth a little coldly.</p>
<p><said>It's so beastly dull and uninteresting. I sup-
pose if there was some fighting to be done it
wouldn't be so bad, but as it is—well, the fellows
one has to associate with don't make the life more
agreeable. Awfully good chaps, of course, and
very well to meet at mess and all that kind of
thing, but outside regimental matters they bore
one to death. Most of 'em are men whose
families hold no sort of position.</said></p>
<p><said>I'm sorry,</said> said Ruth ironically. <said>How came
it you were so unlucky as to enter the army?</said></p>
<p><said>Pitchforked into it, my dear Miss Armitage.
There's always been one soldier of our family in
the service of the Company for the last three
generations, and my father insisted I should re-
present the fourth. Of course, I had to knuckle
under, but it won't be for long; I'm going to
clear out, and that's why I wanted to have a
little confidential chat with you.</said></p>
<p><said>You honour me,</said> rejoined Ruth, with a
sudden flutter of her heart. <said>But what have
I to do with you leaving the army?</said></p>
<p><said>Everything. Can't you guess?</said></p>
<p>He advanced a pace towards her. She re-
treated instinctively.</p>
<pb n="100"/>
<p><said>Don't run away,</said> he went on. <said>I've really
something most important to say, and you <emph>must</emph>
hear it.</said></p>
<p><said><emph>Must</emph>?</said> she repeated in a tone of mingled
surprise and anger.</p>
<p><said>I beg your pardon, I did not mean to speak
so imperatively, but there are times when one
not master of one's words. I'll put what I
wish to say in another form—as a confession,
eh?</said></p>
<p>Ruth had her eyes fixed apprehensively on his
face. It was not a nice face at any time. The
small shifty eyes and scanty brows, the foxy-
coloured side whiskers, the weak, loosely lipped
mouth always gave her an unpleasant im-
pression, and just now his sickly false smile and
his attempt to ingratiate himself were particularly
repugnant.</p>
<p><said>I'd rather not listen to you, Captain Ken-
drick. I hate confessions of any kind,</said> she
exclaimed hastily.</p>
<p><said>Hang it, you don't help a fellow a bit. I
came to tell you that I love you—that I want
you to be my wife. I've never seen any girl half
as nice as you. It isn't as if I was a poor man,
like most of the chaps stationed here. You
know all about my father, don't you? We had
a bit of a shindy some time ago, but that's all
over. He's a first-rate old boy, and I've only
to take you to England, and present you to him,
and he'll do anything you like to ask him. He
wishes me to marry and settle down. He's said
so over and over again in his letters. I can show
them to you if you like.</said></p>
<pb n="101"/>
<p>Howard Kendrick poured out his words
rapidly, but quick as he was in saying them
Ruth had time to regain her self-possession.</p>
<p><said>I'd rather not, thank you. I don't want to
know your father's wishes. They're no concern
of mine. If you're anxious to marry because
your father desires it I'm sure you'll have no
difficulty in finding a lady to oblige both him
and you.</said></p>
<p>Kendrick's lips paled and twitched slightly.
Ruth's sarcasm stung him, but he tried not to
betray himself.</p>
<p><said>You misunderstand me—really you do. It's
not because of my father that I want to marry
you—that would be absurd, childish. I only
dragged him in to show you that with his approval
you'd be as my wife a very rich woman. Do
listen, please.</said></p>
<p>Ruth had turned impatiently from him. She
was asking herself why the man couldn't see that
his proposal was rejected, and his arguments
offensive, without putting her to the embarrass-
ment of telling him so?</p>
<p><said>There's every reason why you should say
yes. We'll be married very quietly—it can
be done to-morrow if you like: I've already
spoken to Strangeways our chaplain about
it——</said></p>
<p><said>What?</said> cried Ruth, wheeling round and
facing him indignantly. <said>You've had the im-
pertinence to tell <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Strangeways you were
going to marry me without having previously
asked my consent?</said></p>
<p><said>No, no; nothing of the kind. Of course, I
<pb n="102"/>
didn't mention your name. I only told him I
had hopes—and so I have, in spite of what you
say—of being married, and that the marriage
might come off quickly. I've already obtained
leave of absence, and directly I reach England I
shall sell my commission, retire, and we shall
take our position in English society among the
best people. Perhaps I shall go into Parliament.
Look here——</said></p>
<p>He came nearer, and casting his eyes round
furtively, went on in a low voice:</p>
<p><said>I'm going to tell you something. I'm in a
position to know that there's trouble ahead in
India. It may come soon; it may come late;
it may blow over, but I'm afraid it won't. Any-
how, Ruth, I'm very anxious about you. I want
to be sure that you're out of danger, and to be
on the safe side, you—that is we—ought to leave
Cawnpore at once. If we delay, the country
may become unsettled, and we may have some
difficulty in reaching Calcutta. I wouldn't have
mentioned this for fear of alarming you, but
you force me to it because you evidently think
I'm not sincere. I love you, darling, so much
that, sooner than a hair of your head should
be injured, I'd——</said></p>
<p><said>I beg you to say no more,</said> interposed Ruth
hotly. <said>Every word you utter puts you in a
more odious light. I'm shocked to hear you
talking of sneaking away directly there's danger.
If trouble's coming it's your duty to stay and
face it.</said></p>
<p><said>Of course—of course,</said> he stammered con-
fusedly, for the word <q>sneak</q> cut him like a
<pb n="103"/>
lash. <said>I wasn't speaking of myself, but of
you.</said></p>
<p><said>Of me,</said> she cried with infinite scorn. <said>You
seem to forget that my father was a soldier, and
that he died facing the enemy. I don't think
we need prolong our talk, Captain Kendrick. I
wish you good evening.</said></p>
<p>Kendrick's face was white with rage and
mortification. He stood still, quite unable to
make any reply. Then as she was passing him
his mind quickened, and he strode hastily in
front of her.</p>
<p><said>One moment, Miss Armitage,</said> he cried.
<said>I &#x2026; don't want you to go away with a false
impression. I didn't speak the truth in what I
said just now about <soCalled>trouble.</soCalled> I thought per-
haps a—a sense of danger would induce you
to say yes if only to—to get away from
Cawnpore, you know. Of course I was wrong.
I ought to have known you were too plucky.
But I don't think you'll be very angry
now that you know what was really in my
mind.</said></p>
<p>Kendrick's explanation, Ruth considered, did
not make the matter much better. At the same
time, she was relieved to find that there was
nothing to fear. Stories of the disturbances at
Berhampore and Barrackpore had reached the
residents in a modified form, and the majority
were not much disturbed. They thought that
the discontent was purely local, and that the
military authorities were fully able to deal with
any difficulty. But Howard Kendrick had used
the words <q>trouble ahead</q> with such emphasis,
<pb n="104"/>
that for the moment she felt quite uneasy.
Uneasiness, however, had now given place to
anger with the discovery that Kendrick had been
trying to play upon her fears.</p>
<p><said>You've done a mean thing,</said> she cried
vehemently. <said>I don't think any more of you,
Captain Kendrick, because you've confessed to
a falsehood.</said></p>
<p><said>Perhaps not,</said> said he, whiter than ever, and
his voice trembling with passion. <said>Anyway,
may I ask you to keep our conversation a secret
between us, especially that part relating to
what you call my—my falsehood?</said></p>
<p><said>Well, and wasn't it one?</said></p>
<p>Her glance was fixed fearlessly on his face.
His eyes could not meet hers. They drooped,
and he seemed overwhelmed with confusion.
He did not answer, and his silence and disturbed
manner raised strange suspicions in her mind.
Her old uneasiness came back.</p>
<p><said>How do I know that what you said in your
attempt to frighten me isn't really true?</said> she
exclaimed. <said>Tell me have you really heard
anything disquieting? You need not hesitate
about speaking frankly. I'm not likely to
scream or faint.</said></p>
<p><said>I know you won't do either,</said> Kendrick
forced himself to say. <said>I swear to you there's
not the least cause for alarm. That's why I
ask you to forget my foolishness. If it got
about that I had said anything to you, why,
it might come back to me, and I hardly know
how I could explain, without bringing your
name in.</said></p>
<pb n="105"/>
<p><said>You needn't trouble. I'm not likely to talk
about you behind your back.</said></p>
<p>Ruth said this in the coldest and most distant
manner, and swept out of the room, leaving
Howard Kendrick gnawing his lower lip, and
looking like a man who had been thoroughly
chastised.</p>
<p>Kendrick was in no mood to meet <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring.
He would have to explain how he had been re-
pulsed, and this repulse was too recent to be
regarded calmly. He stalked out, climbed into
his buggy, and drove back to his bungalow.</p>
<p><said>I'll follow Heron's example,</said> he muttered
savagely, <said>and be suddenly taken ill. I've
already leave of absence, and illness will naturally
hasten my departure.</said></p>
<p>He was received by a string of servants, and
contrary to his usual contemptuous indifference,
he looked searchingly at them. As a rule, when
he spoke to a native he accompanied his orders
with highly ornamental epithets, sometimes in
English, sometimes in Hindustani, and not
infrequently with the addition of a kick or a cuff.
His present scrutiny did not reveal anything
different from the ordinary obsequious de-
meanour, and he entered the bungalow with
an air of relief.</p>
<p>His first act was to send a note to head-quarters
excusing himself from dinner, on account of
indisposition. Then he went through the letters
which had arrived while he was away. They
were all of the same nature—pressing demands
from creditors, who had heard that he was in
funds, and had paid his debts of honour. They
<pb n="106"/>
were, in consequence, eager to have their bills
settled. Kendrick flung the tiresome letters
away with an oath.</p>
<p>He went into the verandah, and gave his
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">chokadars</foreign> instructions not to admit any visitors,
as the Sahib was unwell, and could see no one.
After this he shut himself in his bedroom, mixed
a brandy-and-soda, and threw himself on his bed
to think out his plan of action.</p>
<p><said>It would have been jolly pleasant to have
had that little girl as a companion during the
journey,</said> he muttered. <said>She was a fool not to
say yes. I meant to act square. I'd sounded old
Strangeways, and he was all right. He'd have
married us in two twos, and my marriage would
have suited the governor's book to rights. It's
what he was always hammering at before we
split.</said></p>
<p>Kendrick tried to keep his disappointment on
the surface of his mind, but deep down was a
cankering thought which persisted in surging
upwards. This thought had to do with his
visit to the Bithoor Palace, when, taking Azi-
moolah's hint, he had adroitly flattered the Nana
and had depreciated his own country's strength
and resources. Of course the talk between the
two sounded like the idlest gossip. True, the
Nana spoke once or twice about his rights which
the English Government refused to acknow-
ledge, but he showed no resentment—indeed,
he appeared to regard the matter as one which
it would be hopeless to revive, and madness
to attempt to assert by force.</p>
<p>Kendrick's conscience pricked him, and he
<pb n="107"/>
went over his conversation with the Maharajah
point by point, and told himself he could find
nothing which could be said to suggest definitely
that the Nana contemplated any act of rebellion.
But why the princely gift of which Kendrick
found himself the recipient?</p>
<p>Argue as sophistically as he might, Kendrick
could not forget the exceptionally oiliness of the
Nana's voice and manner, and his eager ques-
tions as to the present condition of England,
after the strain of the Crimean war—an oiliness
contrasting ominously with the unusual glitter
in his dull eyes, when his visitor answered the
questions in a way to justify the opinion held by
hosts of the natives, that England was depopu-
lated, and that nearly all that was left of her
army was in India.</p>
<p>Again, why was Azimoolah so anxious for Ken-
drick to conciliate the Nana in so singular a
fashion? Azimoolah had no particular love for
Kendrick. His feelings as a rule were rather
the reverse, as Kendrick knew well enough.
Why should the ex-<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign> go out of his
way to put money into Kendrick's pocket, simply
for an hour's talk with, and flattery of the Nana?</p>
<p>Another matter for Kendrick to ponder over
was the attitude of the Nana's retinue, and of the
crowds of hangers on. It was suspicious, to say
the least, and Kendrick had not failed to take
heed of it. Bithoor Palace swarmed with a lazy,
disreputable hoard, who were paid four rupees
a month, and had a suit given them once a year.
These scoundrels were little better than the
scum of the bazaars, and found excitement
<pb n="108"/>
whenever they were so minded in plundering
and blackmailing. The ruffians were, as a rule,
cringing enough to their master's English friends,
but they were certainly not cringing to Kendrick
on the occasion of his last visit. Many of them
did not salaam, and others laughed and made
jokes, evidently at the expense of the visitor.</p>
<p>All this seemed corroborative of the reports
brought by Hurst from Benares as to the growing
insolence of the native servants. There might
be nothing in it, but Kendrick's duty was to lay
the matter before his superiors. But how could
he without disclosing all the circumstances?
He dared not let out that he had had a large
sum placed at his disposal by the Nana, especi-
ally as he had allowed it to be understood that
his recent accession of wealth had come from
his father.</p>
<p>Howard Kendrick not only could not run
straight, but was a cur at heart, and in these two
miserable facts lay the groundwork of all his
actions. He was hated by the sepoys under his
command, and he was well aware of that hatred.
If there should be any rising like that at Barrack-
pore, he would be one of the first against whom
the men would turn. Apart from the talk with
the Nana, the mutterings he had overheard
among his company made him all the more in-
clined to believe that clouds were gathering.
As Ruth had shrewdly surmised, he had spoken
the truth, when he told her trouble was ahead,
and secretly he had resolved to leave Cawnpore
as soon as he could.</p>
<p>And never would he come back. He believed
<pb n="109"/>
in his power to talk his father over. A marriage
with Ruth would have helped him considerably,
but as she refused, he would have to manage
without her. For the next three days he kept
indoors. Of course the regimental doctor came
to see him, but it was easy to get on with <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Rogers, who was a different type of man from
Stainton, and only cared for brandy pawnee.</p>
<p>In the meantime, having nothing to do but
drink and smoke, Howard Kendrick found him-
self at the end of these three days ill in reality.
To say the truth, he was on the verge of delirium
tremens.</p>
<p>In the meantime there had been a little scene
between Ruth and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring. The lady
with <soCalled>nerves</soCalled> could easily fly into a passion,
and she stormed at the girl for what she called
her foolishness in refusing Howard Kendrick.
She tried to bring her husband into the matter;
and when she found the Colonel was inclined to
side with Ruth, she turned her batteries of wrath
upon one of the best natured of men. A little
craft was beneath this display of anger. She
anticipated opposition from her husband to her
journey to the Hills, on account of the expense,
and having contrived to work herself into a
hysterical fit, with prostration to follow, the
poor Colonel was only too glad to unloose his
purse strings for the sake of peace and quietness.</p>
<p>It so happened that a family of some position
in Cawnpore were in the same mind as <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Waring, and it was arranged that the latter
should travel with them. It was the 1st of
May when the party set out, never dreaming
<pb n="110"/>
when they bade their many friends farewell,
that they would never see each other again.</p>
<p>In the beginning of May a deceptive calm
rested upon the Central and North-Western
provinces of India. There was no sign of dis-
content; the bazaars were as crowded as ever,
and trade went merrily on, men going about their
avocations with apparent unconcern. Yet all
this time hundreds of Azimoolah's emissaries—
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">moolvies</foreign> (travelling pilgrims), pedlars, <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">goojurs</foreign> or
robbers, barbers, basket-makers, water-carriers,
grass-cutters, mendicants, and nondescripts of
every variety, were quietly spreading rebellion
and promising golden rewards to all who rose
against the yoke of John Company and the
redcoats.</p>
<p>June 23, the centenary of Clive's victory, which
led to the conquest of India, was to be the day
of a simultaneous rising. But events shaped
themselves otherwise. The impatience of the
conspirators at Meerut and Delhi precipitated
the crisis. But for this, the story of the Indian
Mutiny, terrible as it was, might have been very
much worse.</p>

<head type="main">A Danger Signal</head>

<p>It was the 12th of May. The day had been one
of excessive heat even for the hottest month in
the year in India. From morn till night punkahs
had been kept swinging, without making much
apparent difference in the stifling atmosphere.
The English residents were limp and nerveless,
the natives moved silently, stealthily.</p>
<p>The welcome sunset came, and the fiery red
of the western sky changed to a bluish, opalescent
tint. With the cool evening, life seemed to
return to the exhausted Europeans. Lights
began to appear here and there; the whirr of
myriads of insects was heard; carriages contain-
ing ladies dressed in the height of fashion rattled
by; and the <soCalled>Street of Silver</soCalled> was crowded
with sauntering natives, their white clothing
looking ghostly in the pale light.</p>
<p>One of the principal bungalows in the out-
skirts was brilliantly illuminated. From the
open windows came the sound of a piano, and of
a girlish voice sweet and clear. The song was a
simple one, a popular ballad in the fifties. It
would be called slow and sickly sentimental
nowadays, but at that time it was listened to
with delight.</p>
<pb n="112"/>
<p>This evening it was destined to cause a sensa-
tion. The singer had nearly reached the end of
the third verse when the voice trembled, the
birdlike tones ceased, and suddenly she burst
into tears. A lady with a kindly face imme-
diately went to the girl, who had risen from the
piano, her breast heaving convulsively, her eyes
moist and shining.</p>
<p><said>Dearest Ruth,</said> whispered the lady sooth-
ingly, <said>come with me and sit in the verandah.
The cool air will refresh you. This terribly
suffocating day has been too much for your
nerves.</said></p>
<p>The girl made no reply. She had repressed
her sobs, and allowed her friend, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ewart, to
lead her through the French windows to the
bamboo chairs outside.</p>
<p>The incident, trifling as it was, threw a sadness
over the party, though, to be sure, they were not
in particularly high spirits before it happened.
Still, they did their best to drive away the feeling
of gloom. Colonel Waring, tall, soldierly, erect
as a dart, just then entered with an open news-
paper in his hand.</p>
<p><said>Good news,</said> said he cheerily. <said>The <title>Bom-
bay Gazette</title> has just come. Here is what it says:
<q>India is quiet throughout.</q> We've been alarm-
ing ourselves without a cause.</said></p>
<p><said>What is the date of the paper?</said> asked one
of the party, Standridge, the Deputy-Com-
missioner.</p>
<p><said>May 1st,</said> was the Colonel's reply.</p>
<p><said>Eleven days ago. Much may have happened
since then,</said> retorted the Deputy-Commissioner.</p>
<pb n="113"/>
<p><said>Don't take such a pessimistic view of things,
Standridge,</said> returned Colonel Waring a little
sharply. Then looking round the room he
noticed Ruth's absence, and asked where she
was. He was told what had occurred, and he
went into the verandah.</p>
<p><said>You're not ill, I hope, Ruth my dear?</said> he
inquired with concern.</p>
<p><said>No, indeed. I'm much better now. I don't
know how I came to break down. I suddenly
felt sad and nervous and—and something in the
music—I can't tell you what it was—oppressed
me.</said></p>
<p><said>I think she's all right now, Colonel Waring,</said>
said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ewart.</p>
<p><said>Are you sure?</said> The old soldier looked
anxiously at the girl's white face. Ruth seemed
very fragile at that moment; she had crept close
to the lady as though to seek her protection
from some indefinable danger.</p>
<p><said>I'm half sorry I didn't postpone this little
party, especially as <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring is away,</said> went
on the Colonel, taking a seat on the other side of
Ruth. <said>It seems to me we are none of us in
the humour for pleasuring. Yet it would have
been absurd to put it off. It isn't Ruth's fault
that to-day she's twenty-one,</said> he continued,
smiling pleasantly.</p>
<p><said>I don't see you've any occasion for regret,</said>
said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ewart. <said>It's true we're all a little
troubled; but the clouds will soon pass away.
Don't you think so?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes; no doubt—no doubt.</said></p>
<p>But the Colonel spoke in rather a half-hearted
<pb n="114"/>
manner. Perhaps Ruth's attack of indisposition
had depressed him.</p>
<p><said>Have you heard how <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring is pro-
gressing on her journey?</said> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ewart
presently, by way of breaking an embarrassing
silence.</p>
<p><said>Oh yes. The party she's travelling with
have been very lucky. In spite of the irregu-
larity of the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dâk</foreign> service they managed to secure
conveyances, and, of course, when they reach
Raneegunge they'll take the railway, and there'll
be no more difficulty.</said></p>
<p><said>A good many people have been leaving, I'm
told,</said> continued <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ewart. <said>I don't think
they're doing a wise thing. My husband doesn't
believe there's the slightest danger.</said></p>
<p><said>I know Colonel Ewart's opinions thoroughly.
I only hope he's right,</said> said Waring hastily.</p>
<p>Colonel Ewart, of the 51st Native In-
fantry, was one who had faith in the fidelity of
the troops until towards the end of May, when
his views altered.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ruth sat with her head resting
lightly on <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ewart's shoulder, and her hand
in that of her sympathetic friend. Her tears
had ceased, and her large, dark, tender eyes
were gazing thoughtfully into the night.</p>
<p><said>You're better now?</said> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ewart.</p>
<p><said>Oh yes, thank you,</said> she murmured.</p>
<p>The moon was rising, and soon the whole
landscape would be flooded with a pure soft
light, and all things be as visible as in the day.
There was an enclosure in front of the bungalow
prettily laid out with shrubs and flowers. Be-
<pb n="115"/>
yond could be seen the moving forms of natives.
It was light enough to see that many were
sepoys.</p>
<p>Colonel Waring rose, and was saying he would
tell his guests that nothing serious ailed Ruth,
when a harsh, raucous voice was heard in the dis-
tance. The Colonel stood and listened. An
uneasy expression stole over his face.</p>
<p><said>What's the meaning of that? What's the
fellow calling out? Can either of you ladies
distinguish the words?</said></p>
<p>But neither could, and the Colonel came to the
conclusion that some drunken fellow was creating
a disturbance. Soon a man came in sight. lie
was tall and gaunt, he had long white hair and
beard, and was walking very rapidly. He looked
neither to the right nor left, and he did not seem
to be drunk, for he kept a straight line in the
centre of the road. The people fell back to
allow him to pass. The little group in the
verandah of the bungalow watched him till, turn-
ing round by a large building, he was lost to view.</p>
<p>Whatever this man had been shouting, it had
the effect of stopping the traffic for some little
time. The natives crowded together; they were
seen to be talking earnestly and gesticulating.
What did it mean?</p>
<p><said>Strange that none of us could make out
what the fellow was saying,</said> muttered the
Colonel uneasily. <said>I'd better send Jhundoo to
inquire.</said></p>
<p>Jhundoo was the colonel's confidential ser-
vant, and a man who had always been found
trustworthy.</p>
<pb n="116"/>
<p>For some days indefinable, mysterious, and
alarming apprehensions had prevailed in Cawn-
pore. Many had fears they could not combat,
that something dreadful was impending, but
none could suggest grounds for such a supposi-
tion. There certainly was nothing definite. The
native troops went about their duties in the usual
way, and even the uncomfortable greased cart-
ridge question appeared to have subsided. But
the cloud of doubt and uneasiness refused to
disperse.</p>
<p>Ruth and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ewart sat quietly talking,
awaiting the return of the Colonel. One or two
of the ladies came into the verandah to inquire
after Ruth, and finding her quiet and composed
went back to the room, and the music was re-
sumed. In a quarter of an hour Colonel Waring
returned, but he did not go into the verandah;
he remained talking with the officers who were
of the party.</p>
<p><said>Let us go to the Colonel,</said> said Ruth sud-
denly. <said>I don't know why, but I feel terribly
anxious.</said></p>
<p>She and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ewart entered the room and
threaded their way among the guests, Ruth being
stopped every now and then to answer friendly
inquiries as to her health. At last they reached
Colonel Waring.</p>
<p><said>What does Jhundoo say?</said> whispered Ruth
anxiously.</p>
<p><said>Oh, he was told the fellow was a religious
fanatic. Don't think any more about it,</said> re-
joined Colonel Waring, with an air of indiffer-
ence.</p>
<pb n="117"/>
<p>Ruth was not deceived. In the time of danger
woman's perception is quickened, and the girl
could see a suggestion of anxiety under the
Colonel's apparent carelessness.</p>
<p><said>Dear Colonel Waring,</said> she continued en-
treatingly, <said>I don't believe you're telling me all
that Jhundoo said.</said></p>
<p><said>My dear child, I've told you all that's
necessary,</said> he answered with unwonted gravity.</p>
<p><said>No, you haven't. Something's on your mind.
Do you suppose I'm afraid? Have you for-
gotten who was my father?</said></p>
<p>Her words seemed to strike a tender chord in
the old man's heart.</p>
<p><said>You're right,</said> he returned in a low voice.
<said>I can trust you, my dear, but this isn't the
place to tell you much. I don't want to create
a scare. All I can say is that the fellow we
heard shouting is a messenger of evil. Jhundoo
would only tell me as much as this. Whether
he knows more, and is keeping it back, I can't
say.</said></p>
<p><said>Then the messenger has brought bad news?</said></p>
<p><said>No. He simply uttered one word, which
means that the people are to prepare themselves
for something. But it may be utterly meaning-
less. You know what these Indian fanatics
are.</said></p>
<p>This conversation took place near the door
where Colonel Waring and Ruth were standing,
they having withdrawn a little from the rest
in order to talk quietly, and the Colonel had
hardly finished speaking, when Ruth's ayah was
seen approaching hurriedly. The girl's eyes
<pb n="118"/>
looked wild and terror stricken. She whispered
something to Ruth, who, without answering,
turned and repeated to Colonel Waring what
the girl said. Then the three went out together.
Colonel Waring and Ruth were absent about
ten minutes. On their return both were dis-
turbed in looks and manner. A hush fell upon
the company when the Colonel strode into the
centre of the room.</p>
<p><said>Dear friends,</said> said the old soldier in a low,
deep voice, and speaking very slowly, <said>the
brother of Miss Armitage's ayah has just arrived
from Delhi, with terrible—very terrible—news.
The troops have mutinied, and have taken
possession of the city. They have been joined
by rebels from Meerut, where, I fear, disaster
has also happened, but of this the man could tell
me nothing. I've sent Captain Angelo to Sir
Hugh Wheeler to ascertain if he also has heard
anything. The whole thing's so frightful that
I hope there may be some mistake.</said></p>
<p>All listened with breathless, with painfully
strained attention. Fright was written in every
woman's face, and one poor old lady gasped
hysterically <said>My son's in Delhi,</said> and burying
her face in her hands, sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>A strange light had leaped to the eyes of the
men. Their faces were set and stern. If the
intelligence were true, their own lives might ere
long be in danger, and as for their wives, their
sisters, their daughters, their sweethearts—oh,
it was heart-rending to think of.</p>
<p>All that could be done in that agonising
moment was to hope for the best. The men
<pb n="119"/>
tried to restore the courage of the women and
comfort them, and it was pitiful to see how the
latter struggled to keep calm. Meanwhile Colonel
Waring and his brother officers conferred
together as to the best course to take in the event
of the bad news being confirmed.</p>
<p>At last Angelo returned. Men and women
pressed round him. There was no need to ask
questions. His sad face told the tidings.</p>
<p><said>The news is too true,</said> he said simply—
<said>and worse. It is feared that many of our
friends are dead.</said></p>
<p>He could with truth have said butchered,
but he softened his language for the sake of the
women. Then he turned to Colonel Waring,
and told him that the General wished to see him
at once. There was to be a meeting of the
officers at head-quarters. The party was hastily
broken up. Those men who were not soldiers
left with their wives and daughters, and saw
other ladies to their homes. But several of the
women stayed behind; they were anxious to
know what General Wheeler would do. Among
those who remained was <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ewart. Ruth was
very fond of her, and the two sat hand in hand
through a weary two hours.</p>
<p>Then the sound of feet was heard outside.
Colonel Waring and the other officers had re-
turned. Their calm demeanour soothed the
agitation of the ladies. They had thoroughly
discussed the position with the General, and all
had come to the conclusion that no immediate
danger was to be apprehended.</p>
<p><said>Our troops will reach Delhi in a few days,
<pb n="120"/>
and these rascals will receive such a lesson as
they have never had before,</said> said Colonel Waring.</p>
<p>This was Waring's firm conviction, as it was
the conviction also of the vast majority of his
brother officers; but despite his confidence that
all was well, and that there were no signs of
disaffection among the troops, the night was an
anxious one, and all were glad to see the sun
rise upon the undisturbed and placid streets.</p>
<p>Although there was nothing like a panic,
several of the Europeans prepared to leave the
station. Some set out for Agra, travelling by
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dâk</foreign>, despite the rumour that a very large body
of thieving <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">goojurs</foreign> were coming down from
Delhi. Others hired boats, and ordered them
to be kept in readiness, intending to leave for
Allahabad directly there was the slightest sign
of an outbreak. The more timid did not wait
for this, but departed at once for Calcutta.</p>
<p>The European officers and soldiers were kept
continually on the alert. They, whatever might
be their lot, would have to stick to their posts,
and their wives and families must share their
fate. But not one uttered a murmur.</p>

<p>A week went over since the news of the mutiny
at Meerut reached Cawnpore, and most of the
English here thought the native soldiers would
remain loyal. Yet there were many sinister
and unfortunate incidents. Ill-luck, indeed,
seemed to hover over the English, for it so hap-
pened that a large supply of wheaten flour
arrived by boat from the upper Ganges, and was
sold off very cheaply. The flour was old and
musty, and disagreeable in flavour. Instantly
a rumour spread, that the British Government,
wishing to break down the caste of the natives,
had purposely sent down this flour, mixed up
with the ground bones of cows and pigs.</p>
<p>On the 19th the European residents were
seized with a vague and indefinable alarm. No
one knew what to do, and no one could ascertain
what cause there was for apprehension. Yet
there were plenty of rumours. One was that
mutiny was about to break out; another, that the
<soCalled xml:lang="hi">goojurs</soCalled> from Delhi were coming to plunder
Cawnpore.</p>
<p>What added to the general disquietude was
that there was no place for safety. The officers
<pb n="122"/>
and military residents had previously removed
to new and partly finished barracks to the east
of the Ganges Canal, for the reason that the
native infantry were stationed there. The build-
ing of these barracks—not brick buildings, such
as we see in England, but a series of huts, each
man having his own, where he lodged his family
—was unfortunate. The sepoys grumbled at
having to change to incomplete buildings, while
those they had vacated were standing empty.
It was a grievance that they were not allowed
to remain in their old quarters until the new
ones were quite ready. Excepting in regard to
position, the military were well provided for,
but the only shelter for civilians was the magazine
on the banks of the river. This building had a
high wall round it, and a spacious compound,
with several large, roomy buildings, and was
suitable for refuge; but then it was a long
distance—five miles—from the new native in-
fantry cantonments just mentioned, and the
general did not think it safe to leave the troops
to themselves at so great a distance. So for
the moment should there be an outbreak, it was
quite uncertain what the residents would do.</p>
<p>A deputation of merchants waited upon
General Wheeler to ask his advice. The General
was of opinion that there was no immediate cause
for alarm, but suggested that every non-military
man should arm himself. As for the ladies
and children, they might take shelter in two
long barracks within the city. This the civilians
did not think satisfactory; but they resolved,
in case of any sudden danger, that if there was
<pb n="123"/>
not time to go to the barracks, they would
assemble in the shop of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hay, one of the
principal merchants. In the meantime, Sir
Hugh Wheeler was making his preparations
by ordering an earth wall to be thrown up
round some of the new barracks near the quarters
of the native infantry, never dreaming that by
so doing he was sealing the doom of his country-
men and women.</p>
<p>For two days Ruth had not left the house,
but in the cool of the evening of the 20th she
was tempted to stroll with her ayah beyond the
compound. They passed a group of soldiers,
and Ruth noticed that they had not their
customary quiet and respectful demeanour.
They were talking and laughing loudly. They
glanced boldly and impudently at her, and she
resolved to return to the bungalow at once.
But before she did so, she observed a curious
circumstance. Something was being passed
from one to another. To Ruth it appeared to
be a leaf. Every member of a group handled
this, whatever it was; then it was taken to the
next group, and the same process was gone
through. Clearly it meant some secret sign.
She asked the ayah if she could explain, but the
ayah either did not know or would not say.</p>
<p>Greatly troubled, Ruth hurried back, and to
her relief found that Colonel Waring had just
come in from General Wheeler. She at once
told him what she had seen. The troubled look
which crept into his face frightened her.</p>
<p><said>Ruth, my dear,</said> said he slowly, <said>the time
we have all dreaded has come. You must make
<pb n="124"/>
instant preparations for moving to the can-
tonments. Not a moment is to be lost. What
you saw was the passing of the lotus leaf. The
same thing was noticed before the insubordina-
tion at Barrackpore, and before the outbreak at
Meerut. My dear girl, I fear the worst! It
will be a hard time for all of us. But don't
meet troubles half way. We shall pull through
all right. I'm glad—very glad my wife went
away.</said></p>
<p>Ruth, curious to know the significance of the
passing of the lotus leaf, put some questions
about it. She had heard about the passing of
the chupatty, but the lotus leaf was new to her.</p>
<p><said>I can't explain exactly what the difference
is,</said> returned the Colonel hastily. <said>The fact is,
no one knows the meaning of these distributions
save that they imply a secret signal of some kind.
The lotus is only used among the soldiers, for
the ordinary natives the chupatty is employed.
I've been told that the passing of the chupatty
is not necessarily an ill-omen, but has its origin
in some vow. It's all very well to say that, but
to my mind it doesn't make the matter any
better—it all depends upon the nature of the vow.
But don't let your thoughts dwell upon the
thing, child. India is full of puzzles, and some of
these puzzles when their significance is discovered
are childish enough.</said></p>
<p>Then the Colonel, with a look of preoccupation
on his face, hurried away, leaving Ruth to puzzle
out the meaning of the mystery and romance
conveyed in his words as best she could. The
lotus had always attracted her, and she had been
<pb n="125"/>
content to admire the gigantic leaf, smooth and
shining, the tall and quivering stem, and the
majesty with which it towered above its humbler
companions; but after Colonel Waring's words,
the blood-red flowers of the variety grown in
Bengal seemed to have a sinister aspect. Ruth's
ayah, who was full of Hindoo traditions, had
told her how the lotus was the symbol of the
great god Vishnu, who in many of the temples is
represented as seated upon the lotus in the midst
of waters. The flower was dedicated to Laksmi,
the wife of Vishnu; it was regarded by the Hin-
doos as an emblem of the world, the whole plant
signifying both the earth and its two principles
of fecundation. It was a favourite offering at
the temples, and its poetic side was the legend
that the red lotus was dyed by the blood of Siva,
that flowed from the wound inflicted by the
arrow of Kavina, the Indian god of love. The
ayah was never tired of repeating love-stories in
which the lotus figured in all the wealth of
Oriental imagery.</p>
<p>Ruth was pondering troublously on the lotus
and its associations, when her thoughts were
rudely broken into by guttural voices heard from
without. The hoarse sounds were at first like
the distant roar of an angry sea. Then they
rose to shrill shouts, to sink afterwards to sullen
whispers. Ruth dared not go into the verandah
to find out the cause of the disturbance, but ran
agitatedly in search of the Colonel. She found
him buckling on his sword.</p>
<p><said>Don't be alarmed,</said> said he quietly. <said>I'm
going to see what this hubbub means.</said></p>
<pb n="126"/>
<p><said>No, no,</said> cried the girl, with a sudden burst
of fear. <said>You must not go!</said></p>
<p><said>Nonsense; it's my duty! Besides, I'm con-
vinced there's no actual danger. I believe the
troops in Cawnpore are thoroughly faithful, and
will resist the attempts which are being made to
corrupt them. I'd stake my existence on the
loyalty of my own regiment.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, yes; I know that the men love you—
and so they ought; but who can tell what may
happen when——</said></p>
<p>She stopped. The room was suddenly illu-
mined by a dull, reddish light.</p>
<p>Quickly disengaging himself from the frightened
girl, Colonel Waring hastened out of the room
to the compound. The sky in the direction of
the lines of the 1st Native Infantry was broken
by the glare of fire, with here and there tongues
of flame shooting upwards. It was from this
quarter that the sounds of voices were proceeding.
Crushing her fears Ruth ran into the verandah.</p>
<p>The moon was shining brightly. The whole
landscape was flooded with a pale, silver light,
save where the fire had broken out. Ruth
could see yellow flames and myriads of red sparks
in the midst of clouds of smoke. The fire, she
thought, was not spreading, indeed, short as the
time was since its outbreak, it seemed already
to be dying down.</p>
<p>All at once the girl was seized with a dis-
quieting sensation that she was not alone. Yet
she could not see any one, for the panic-stricken
servants had fled, nobody could say whither.
Suddenly, though she had heard no footstep, not
<pb n="127"/>
even the rustle of a garment, she saw a man
standing close to her—so close, indeed, that he
had but to stretch his arm, to touch her. She
involuntarily recoiled, as much through the sud-
den and mysterious appearance of the man as
by the personality of the man himself.</p>
<p>She recognised Azimoolah Khan, the treasurer,
the right hand, the governing spirit of Nana
Sahib. The Hindoos called him the Nana's
<foreign xml:lang="hi">vakeel</foreign>. Despite his courtly and insinuating
manners, Ruth hated the man.</p>
<p><said>I have not frightened you, I trust, Miss
Armitage,</said> said he in his smooth, oily voice, and
with a deferential inclination of the head.</p>
<p><said>No,</said> Ruth answered coldly. <said>Still, I should
prefer to have had your coming announced.</said></p>
<p><said>Ah! there is no time for ceremony.</said></p>
<p><said>What do you mean?</said></p>
<p>In spite of her desire not to appear timid before
Azimoolah, she could not prevent her voice
trembling slightly.</p>
<p><said>I dare not tell you all. I can only say that
I have come here to save you. Before many
days are over, something terrible will happen.
You know, perhaps, what has taken place at
Meerut, and Delhi, and Futtehpore——</said></p>
<p><said>Futtehpore?</said> cried the girl. <said>No bad
news has come from Futtehpore. Why, it was
but the other day that the Oudh Cavalry were
marched there, and Lieutenant Ashe, with a
battery, was ordered to follow yesterday.</said></p>
<p><said>Lieutenant Ashe will get there too late.
The Oudh Cavalry have murdered their officers.
Captain Hayes and Captain Carey are dead.</said>
<pb n="128"/>
Azimoolah bent his head and whispered the
words in her ear.</p>
<p>All the blood seemed to rush to Ruth's heart,
and leave the surface of her body icy cold. It
was only within the last few days she had met
both Hayes and Carey at a dance given by
Lady Wheeler. They were then full of life and
gaiety; and now—but she could not think of
the contrast. It was too appalling.</p>
<p><said>You tremble, Miss Armitage,</said> continued the
Mussulman, in a soft, purring voice. <said>It is only
natural; but you at least have nothing to fear
if you trust me. At Bithoor shelter and safety
await you. Nay, if Colonel Waring chooses to
avail himself of the Nana's hospitality, as he
and his friends have often done before, he is
welcome.</said></p>
<p>The man's words roused all the girl's spirit.
She could only look upon an invitation to Nana
Sahib's palace at Bithoor as an insult. The
Nana was rarely visited by English ladies.</p>
<p><said>Go back to your master, Azimoolah Khan,
and tell him I desire neither his friendship nor
his shelter. I mistrust both.</said></p>
<p><said>Aha,</said> said he, <said>you are not like the English
officers, Miss Armitage; they trust the Nana.
Has he not offered to General Wheeler his assis-
tance to guard the treasury at Nawabgunge?</said></p>
<p><said>I heard so,</said> returned Ruth hurriedly; <said>but
it makes no difference in my opinion.</said></p>
<p><said>Think well before you refuse,</said> said Azi-
moolah Khan slowly, and with emphasis. <said>You
know not what is coming. England is growing
weaker; we in India are becoming stronger.
<pb n="129"/>
You have taught us to use your weapons; you
have shown us how you conquered our land, and
we may turn the lesson to good account.</said></p>
<p><said>This comes well from you, Azimoolah Khan,</said>
she cried, with indignation. <said>You have been
in England, and you know something of us.
You, like Nana Sahib, have always said you were
friendly to the English.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, I have said so,</said> interposed the Mussul-
man smoothly.</p>
<p><said>Why then do you not exert yourself to
influence your countrymen?</said></p>
<p><said>It is useless. Who can fight against the de-
crees of fate? When the floodgates of passion,
of revenge——</said></p>
<p><said>Revenge! What have you to revenge?
What have we done?</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, I only put the case as thousands look
at it. For myself, I have received many kind-
nesses from English men, and from</said>—he laughed
slily—<said>English women too. But I am power-
less. I know what is in store for your country-
men in India, Miss Armitage. They will be
driven into the <soCalled>black water.</soCalled> Not a soul will
remain on Indian soil. But I would save those
of the English whom I love, and that is why I
beg you to come with me while there's yet time.</said></p>
<p><said>Come—with you?</said> repeated Ruth slowly,
and as though she had not heard aright.</p>
<p><said>It is your only chance of life—of <emph>life</emph>, re-
member. Before long even I may not be able
to save you.</said></p>
<p>He was now quite close to her. He would
have grasped her wrist, but she retreated. She
<pb n="130"/>
was seized with an uncontrollable horror of this
man, with his velvety voice and snake-like
manner. Yet she had heard women—English
women—talk admiringly of his fascinations.</p>
<p><said>My answer is, No!</said> she cried. <said>Not even
to save my life would I go to Bithoor.</said></p>
<p><said>Very well then, there is another way,</said> said
he rapidly. <said>The Nana shall not know that
you have refused his offer. I will charge myself
with your safety. You need not go to Bithoor.
Come to the river. I have a boat in readiness,
and I will take you to Allahabad.</said></p>
<p><said>No. Come when Colonel Waring is here,
and talk to him.</said></p>
<p><said>Colonel Waring? What can he do? Maybe
you'll never see him again.</said></p>
<p>There was something in his tone which set her
nerves vibrating, her senses on the alert.</p>
<p><said>Ah, I see,</said> she cried. <said>This is a trick—it is
treachery! If anything happens to Colonel
Waring it will be at your instigation.</said></p>
<p><said>How unjust you are, Miss Armitage. Is it
possible I could wish harm to any friend of
<emph>yours</emph>? Ah, Miss Armitage——</said></p>
<p>He stopped suddenly. His quick ear had
caught the sound of a footstep. It had the
effect upon him of an electric shock. He clapped
his hands sharply. Instantly the gardens be-
came alive with dusky forms running from
behind the thickets.</p>
<p><said>You see I have laid my plans,</said> hissed
Azimoolah.</p>
<p>The next moment Ruth was surrounded by
his followers—some of the worst of the many
<pb n="131"/>
ruffians in the pay of the Nana. But it was only
for a second.</p>
<p><said>You scoundrels—you devils,</said> shouted an
English voice, and right and left went a couple
of the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign> to the ground, felled like bul-
locks. Fright seized the rest; they took to
their heels, and apparently Azimoolah among
them, for he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Ruth, white as a lily, and trembling from head
to foot, found herself faced by Dick Heron,
flushed and panting. He had his revolver in
readiness, but he had not fired it for fear of
hitting Ruth; now, however, he sent a bullet
after the fugitives.</p>
<p><said>Thank God I'm in time,</said> cried Dick brok-
enly. <said>The villains haven't hurt you, have
they?</said></p>
<p><said>No, Dick. I——</said></p>
<p>She could say no more. To hear himself called
by the old name of their days of friendship, sent
Dick's heart bounding. It was as much as he
could do to explain that, hearing of the disturb-
ance, he had sprung from his bed, leaped on a
horse, half dressed as he was, and had galloped
straight to Colonel Waring's bungalow.</p>
<p><said>How good of you, Dick—and you so ill
too,</said> cried Ruth, clasping her hands.</p>
<p><said>That's nothing. I'm nearly well. I met
the Colonel, and he told me to hurry here and
take you to General Wheeler's entrenchment.
The bungalows in the cantonments aren't safe
any longer, for you and the other ladies.</said></p>
<p><said>But what has happened? Is Colonel
Waring——?</said></p>
<pb n="132"/>
<p>She could not continue. Azimoolah's omi-
nous words were fresh in her mind.</p>
<p><said>He's quite safe; but he's unable to come to
you just now. Don't be alarmed. The fire's
almost extinguished. It broke out in the lines
of the 1st Native Infantry. Our fellows ran
down six guns, and I guess the sight was enough.
Anyhow, the men are obeying orders, and it may
be the fire was accidental. In the hubbub,
Colonel Waring was struck by a stone—oh it's
nothing much, I assure you——</said></p>
<p><said>The poor Colonel!</said> cried Ruth agitatedly.
<said>I must go to him at once. You'll take me,
won't you?</said></p>
<p>She turned her swimming eyes imploringly
upon the lad. He longed to kiss her tears away.</p>
<p><said>I can't,</said> said he quickly. <said>The Colonel's
orders are imperative. I wasn't to lose a moment
in escorting you to the entrenchment. There's
all the more reason to hurry after what hap-
pened just now. I thought I saw that slimy
scoundrel Azimoolah among the mob who were
round you. Was I right?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes—but——</said></p>
<p><said>The first time I meet the rascal I'll give him
the soundest thrashing man ever had. But we
won't talk about him. Run indoors and get
a few things together. You may want them.</said></p>
<p>There was an air of authority about Dick
Heron, which sat well on the lad. Ruth never
liked him so much as now. She obeyed without
a word, and returned in about ten minutes,
accompanied by her ayah, who was carrying a
light portmanteau. Dick Heron took Ruth's
<pb n="133"/>
arm and they set out to walk to the canton-
ments. The latter were quite distinct from
the city, and were spread over an extent of six
miles in a semicircular form along the banks of
the Ganges.</p>
<p>The three reached the border of the canton-
ments without anything untoward happening.
They were now in a road bordered by trees.
Before them lay the plain, and they could see in
the distance the wall of sandy earth which had
been hastily thrown up, forming the entrench-
ment.</p>
<p><said>Five minutes' walk beyond those trees,</said>
said Dick encouragingly, <said>and we shall be
inside the——</said></p>
<p>At that moment a musket was fired not four
yards from them. Then came a piercing scream
from her ayah, and Ruth felt Dick's grasp sud-
denly relax. She turned swiftly, but was
unable to save him from falling. He was lying
at her feet motionless, and blood was trickling
down his cheek. The next moment she was
kneeling on the ground, holding Dick Heron's
wrist.</p>
<p><said>I can feel no pulse,</said> she cried piteously.
<said>Oh if——</said></p>
<p>Her words died away in a mournful cry. She
could see nothing, think of nothing but the poor
lad so treacherously struck down. She was
unconscious of the gleaming eyes, the cruel
pouting lips of the woman who was peering at
her through the foliage. But Nadia saw the
sinister face and recognised it.</p>
<p><said>Hooseinee Khanum!</said> whispered the ayah
<pb n="134"/>
in terror-stricken tones, and in an instant the
woman disappeared.</p>
<p><said>Come away, Missee Ruth—come away,</said>
cried Nadia, shaking from head to foot.</p>
<p>Nadia turned and fled, and Ruth never saw
the girl again. She was not long alone, for the
sentry on guard at the earthworks had given
the alarm, and the picket was hastening towards
her, while inside the entrenchment a sudden
activity had arisen, for no one could tell that the
shot might not be the signal for the attack.
The officer in command of the picket knew Ruth,
and she told him rapidly what had happened.</p>
<p><said>By Jove, this looks like an attempt at
assassination from private motives. I don't
think it has anything to do with revolt,</said> he
returned in a low voice. <said>Poor Heron! Hard
luck to be shot without a chance of defending
oneself. Let me take you inside the fort, Miss
Armitage. This is no sight for you.</said></p>
<p><said>No no, I won't leave him,</said> she returned
doggedly.</p>
<p>The officer allowed her to do as she pleased.
The picket improvised a litter, and the uncon-
scious Dick was carried inside the entrenchment,
and the surgeon summoned.</p>
<p><said>He's not dead,</said> said the doctor. <said>A nar-
row shave though. The bullet hasn't entered
the skull; it's merely a graze. The lad's a bit
run down, that's why he fainted.</said></p>
<p>It was a relief to hear this, and Ruth allowed
herself to be taken to the friends who had pre-
ceded her in seeking the shelter of the entrench-
ment. While sympathising with her, the ladies
<pb n="135"/>
could not resist their own feelings of alarm. To
what terrible tragedy was this attack destined
to be the prelude? So far as they knew, Dick
was the first one in Cawnpore to be struck by a
hostile bullet. How many would follow? The
trembling women dared not ask this question
of each other, yet it was in the minds of all.</p>
<p>Morning dawned, and with the bright sun
came fresh hope. Nothing had happened within
the city, and it was settled that the fire was
purely accidental. Ruth hoped and expected
to see Colonel Waring, but he sent word that he
must remain with his men, as all the other
officers were doing.</p>
<p>It was now May 21. At dawn women and
children crowded into the barracks, according
to orders, and the accommodation began to be
limited.</p>
<p><said>What the place will be like if the wives and
families of the civilians come here too, I can't
imagine,</said> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ewart.</p>
<p><said>Are they coming, then?</said> asked Ruth.</p>
<p><said>They must. There's no other shelter,</said>
answered the lady. <said>It's a pity the magazine
was not chosen instead of this entrenchment;
but I suppose General Wheeler had his reasons.</said></p>
<p>Sir Hugh Wheeler's selection of the spot for
his entrenchment has been severely criticised.
It was in an exposed situation; its breast-high
earthwork provided but a feeble protection,
and gave little or no shelter. Moreover, the
soil was dry and scrubby, thanks to its being the
dry season, and offered little more resistance
than a sieve.</p>
<pb n="136"/>
<p>On the morning of this day, the sergeant-
major's wife of the 53rd, a Eurasian by birth,
went marketing to the native bazaar, when she
was accosted by a sepoy out of regiment
dress.</p>
<p><said>You will some of you not come here much
oftener,</said> were his sinister words. <said>You will
not be alive another week.</said></p>
<p>She came back in great alarm, and told Ruth
and one or two other ladies; and though they
were much frightened they prudently kept the
story from the rest, telling only the General what
they heard.</p>
<p><said>Do not worry yourselves, ladies,</said> said the
old General. <said>I think I know the sepoys as
well as any man in India, and you may depend
upon it, this is all bombast.</said></p>
<p>And acting according to his firm belief, General
Wheeler visited the lines daily, chatted with the
sepoys, and tried to invite their confidence, but
could get no certain knowledge of anything like
plotting, except in the case of one of the 56th
Native Infantry, who was actually given up by
some of the sepoys for attempting to spread
sedition, and was sentenced to be hanged,
though it was considered prudent not to carry
out the sentence.</p>
<p>On the 22nd there was a welcome arrival in
the shape of a detachment of H.M. 32nd Regi-
ment, sent from Lucknow by the chivalrous Sir
Henry Lawrence, though he could ill spare them,
and this accession of strength brought confidence
with it. As the flight to the hastily-thrown-up
entrenchment was having a bad effect on the
<pb n="137"/>
sepoys, all who had taken shelter there went
back to their homes.</p>
<p>Ruth was very anxious about Dick, but in the
hurry and confusion of the removal she did not
see him. Perhaps it was as well, for in her
agitation of mind she might have revealed her
suspicion, namely, that Azimoolah Khan was at
the bottom of the attempt to assassinate him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, though outwardly everything had
quieted down, there was an undercurrent of ex-
citement among the troops, so much so that it
was not considered advisable to fire the usual
salute on the Queen's birthday, May 24. About
this date the Nana carried into effect the offer
he had made to Sir Hugh Wheeler, which the
latter with inconceivable fatuity accepted. This
was the <soCalled>proof</soCalled> of his friendly disposition
towards the English mentioned to Ruth by
Azimoolah Khan; and moving to a bungalow near
the treasury with about 500 armed men of his
own, and two small guns, the Nana took charge
of the place and of the treasure. Virtually Sir
Hugh had delivered himself into the hands of
the rebels; and when, some little time after-
wards, he removed into his entrenchment, leav-
ing the magazine, its guns and its stores of
ammunition for the benefit of the enemy, he
crowned his misplaced confidences with an act
of folly for which the infirmity of years—he was
seventy-four—is the only excuse.</p>

<head type="main"><q>For God's Sake Send Us Troops!</q></head>

<p>Quick as the voyage was—quick, at least, for
those days—it seemed far too slow for Philip
Heron's impatience, and the pilot brigs, tossing
to and fro on the crested waves at the mouth of
the Hooghly, were to him the most welcome
sight in the world.</p>
<p>An soon as the steamer entered the treacherous
channel of the river, she took up a pilot, and there
was a stoppage for half an hour at Kedgeree,
where dispatches from Calcutta were brought on
board. Letters were rapidly distributed, and
Heron looked with envy at his fellow-passengers,
who were eagerly devouring the contents of the
epistles written by their expectant friends.</p>
<p>There was no letter for him—how could there
be? No one knew he was coming. It is true
he had written to Dick on the eve of his de-
parture, but his letter was at that moment lying
in a mail-sack which would not be landed until
the steamer reached Calcutta. He imagined
this his letter would anticipate his arrival at
Cawnpore by a few days only.</p>
<p>Heron asked for an Indian newspaper, but
there was none to be had. Usually a number of
copies were brought to Kedgeree, but not on this
<pb n="139"/>
occasion. Others like himself were disappointed,
and could not understand the reason. How
could they tell that since they had left England,
events had followed thick and fast, and that at
that very moment Calcutta was convulsed with
the news of a disaster in comparison with which
the disaffection at Barrackpore and Dum-Dum
was a mere trifle? No wonder all the news-
papers in Calcutta had been eagerly bought up!</p>
<p>As he paced up and down the deck, watching
the various readers, Heron was struck with the
fact that the faces of those who had received
letters bore the same expression. Everybody
was absorbed. Each eye had a strange glitter of
suppressed excitement. He passed a group
gathered round one man, who was reading his
letter aloud. He evidently regarded the con-
tents as public property, and it was no breach of
good manners on Heron's part to stop and
listen. <q>At first,</q> wrote the reader's correspon-
dent, <q>we could not believe the terrible news,
and we anxiously looked for a contradiction.
But instead of contradiction came confirmation,
and the facts are a good deal worse than the
rumour. There is no doubt that Colonel Finnis
and a number of his officers have been shot by
their men. Ladies have also been murdered.
How horrible to think of! It seems that nothing
was done to stop the progress of the outbreak,
and the mutineers rushed away to Delhi, and
now hold possession of the city. This Meerut
affair occurred on May 11, and the news reached
Calcutta three weeks ago. Lord Canning is
doing all he can to hurry up reinforcements, for
<pb n="140"/>
all kinds of rumours are afloat about the safety
of Cawnpore and Lucknow, but there are but
few troops here, and travelling is terribly slow.
A welcome arrival came two days ago, in the
shape of Colonel Neill with his Fusiliers from
Madras. We are terribly anxious.</q></p>
<p>Then the letter passed on to private details.</p>
<p>At first the effect was paralysing. The pas-
sengers looked at each other dazed and stunned.
Mutiny? Why, it was incredible! Then it
seemed slowly to dawn upon them that they had
friends and relatives at Meerut, at Delhi, at
Allahabad, at Lahore, at Cawnpore, at Luck-
now. A lady who was about to join her husband
in Delhi burst into tears; another, whose son
was an officer stationed at Meerut, fainted.
Others, for whom there was no relief in the shape
of tears, sat with white, drawn faces—they
seemed to have aged ten years in five minutes.</p>
<p>Heron went from one group to another seeking
news, but got little beyond what he had heard
at first. No one, at all events, could tell him any
recent intelligence concerning Cawnpore. The
correspondent of one lady, indeed, wrote from
Cawnpore, but her letter was dated quite a
fortnight before the outbreak at Meerut. Her
letter was a mere record of gaiety, concerts, balls,
dinner-parties, and a little gossip about the latest
scandal. One item, however, interested Heron.</p>
<p><q>The new Lucknow Commissioner, Sir Henry
Lawrence,</q> wrote the lady, <q>seems to be a great
success. He is immensely popular, and has great
influence with the natives. I should think it
quite impossible for any disturbance to happen
<pb n="141"/>
in Lucknow while Sir Henry is there. I hope
he'll be able to help Cawnpore if help is wanted,
though that isn't likely. No man in India knows
and understands the natives better than he does.
Lady Wheeler, you know, is a native of India——</q></p>
<p><said aloud="false">No news is good news,</said> thought Heron, and
he comforted himself with the reflection that
Cawnpore at present appeared to be quite safe,
and he tried to interest himself in the scenery on
either side of the noble river, for the steamer
was now proceeding up the Hooghly as rapidly
as the pilot would permit.</p>
<p>The picturesque groves of cocoanuts reached
to the water's edge, and their bending boughs
threw a grateful shade on the stream. The river
was full of native boats of endless variety, some
skimming the surface like sea-birds, others
hugging the shore and creeping lazily along in
the shadow of the trees. Then as the vessel
neared Garden Reach the groves of cocoanuts
gave place to shrubberies and large stretches of
grass-land, beautifully kept. On nearing Cal-
cutta, the progress was very slow, for the centre
of the channel, carefully marked out with buoys,
had to be strictly kept. Fort William, looking
squat and ugly and almost diminutive, was
passed, and soon after the steamer was moored.</p>
<p>Heron congratulated himself on his prudence
in bringing so little luggage. He was able at
once to go ashore with all his belongings. He
jumped into a running jetty conveyance, and
was taken to an hotel, where he deposited his
property. Then he hastened to report himself
to Lord Canning at Government House.</p>
<pb n="142"/>
<p>Though the hour was so early, the narrow
streets were crowded. The air was full of the
hum of talk—soft, musical accents, with now and
then a shrill laugh. The people, in their snow-
white dresses reaching just below the knee, their
turbans of varied colours, and their dusky faces
looked picturesque to the eye, but in Heron's
present frame of mind he regarded them with
suspicion.</p>
<p>Just as he emerged from the native quarter,
he heard sounds which stirred every nerve in his
body. It was the warlike notes of the High-
land pipers. Philip Heron had not heard them
since that memorable day when Sir Colin Camp-
bell led his brigade up the heights of Alma.
Five minutes' walk brought him within sight of
a detachment of the 78th Highlanders, in
their national dress, marching with that springy,
elastic step he had seen and admired so often.
Heron had many friends among the 78th, and he
could not resist the impulse to run forward and as-
certain if he could recognise any of his old chums.</p>
<p>He halted when he was twenty or thirty yards
ahead, and waited for the men to approach.
On they came like a solid wall. They would pass
where Heron was standing by but a couple of
yards or so. The first two ranks had scarcely
gone by, when he heard his name shouted in a
voice which suggested the moors and the heather
of Scotland.</p>
<p><said>Eh, man! but ye'll be Phil Heron, or may
I never know what the taste of whisky is again!</said></p>
<p>It was Captain Donald Macintyre, the noisiest,
the most reckless, the best-hearted fellow that
<pb n="143"/>
ever breathed; a giant in stature, and with hair
as fiery as his own nature.</p>
<p><said>I'd swear I was Philip Heron, even if that
wasn't my name, rather than that your intimate
acquaintance with whisky should cease, old
fellow,</said> shouted Heron.</p>
<p><said>Weel, that's spoken like a friend.</said></p>
<p>The next moment their hands were clasped.</p>
<p><said>And what are ye doing here, man?</said></p>
<p>Heron told him in a few breathless words.</p>
<p><said>Laddie, ye're the man for us. We start for
Raneegunge in two hours. A company of the
64th go with us, just to make the party not too
Scottish, ye see,</said> said Macintyre, with a grin.
<said>Now run away to the Government House and
see Lord Canning. It's a pity ye're not a Scots-
man; but ye're Yorkshire, and that's not so far
away from the border.</said></p>
<p><said>But where are you going?</said></p>
<p><said>First to Benares, then to Allahabad,
then to Cawnpore, and maybe to Lucknow, if
we're wanted. Colonel Jack Neill with his
<soCalled>Lambs</soCalled>——</said></p>
<p><said>Colonel Neill?</said> cried Heron. <said>Not
Colonel Neill who was in the Crimea?</said></p>
<p><said>The very man. He reached Calcutta a fort-
night ago, with nine hundred of his Fusiliers, and
they're now on their way. If there's any fighting
to be done, Jack Neill's the lad to do it.</said></p>
<p>Donald Macintyre was quite right. Neill was
an Ayrshire man, and the hereditary fierceness
of his ancestors still lingered in him. No fitter
nature for the task of retribution which he had
to perform could be found. He was not one to
<pb n="144"/>
temper justice with mercy. Philip Heron re-
membered him well as an energetic officer of the
Turkish contingent in the Crimea. Lord Can-
ning, at his wits' end for troops, had telegraphed
to Madras, and Colonel Neill, with <soCalled>the Lambs,</soCalled>
as the 1st Madras Fusiliers were called, and of
which he was the commander, lost not one
instant in bringing his men up to Calcutta.</p>
<p><said>What time do you set out, Macintyre?</said>
asked Heron hurriedly.</p>
<p><said>My men are ready now, but the 64th haven't
shown up. They only landed yesterday, ye see,
from Rangoon. The train's timed to start at
six, but I'm thinking we'll not be on the road
before eight. I'm dying to see the long face
that pock-pudding of a station-master will pull
when he finds his blitherin' time-table of nae
guid. Eh. What a lesson John Neill gave him!
But I'll tell you that another time. Run to his
Excellency as fast as your legs can carry ye.</said></p>
<p>Heron took the kindly Scot's advice. In less
than twenty minutes he was at the Government
House, waiting for an audience, and impatiently
kicking his heels in a waiting-room, together with
a dozen men all anxious to see the Governor-
General on important business. Luckily, Heron
had a letter of introduction from an East India
Company's director, also his War Office cre-
dentials; and within a quarter of an hour he was
admitted to the presence of his Excellency,
greatly to the chagrin of others who had been
waiting a longer time than he had.</p>
<p>Lord Canning's kindly, amiable face looked
worn and worried, as well it might, for his
<pb n="145"/>
dominion in India was beginning to tremble in
the balance. The Governor was in possession
of the latest information, and this showed that
the rebellion was spreading fast.</p>
<p>The news from the districts north of Allahabad
was alarming. Between May 25 and 30 the
sepoys at Ferozepoor, Allyghur, Etawah, and
Bolundshun had mutinied. Regiments had
been disbanded at Lahore, martial law had
been proclaimed in the North-west provinces
by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Colvin, the Lieutenant-Governor. Great
fears were being entertained as to the safety of
Cawnpore, Lucknow, and Agra. Delhi was still
in the hands of the rebels. Everywhere the cry
was, <q>For God's sake, send troops!</q></p>
<p>Only a fortnight before, on May 30, Lord
Canning had dispatched this telegram to General
Anson, in command of the British forces then
besieging Delhi:</p>
<p><q>I have heard to-day that you do not expect
to be in Delhi before the 9th. In the meantime,
Cawnpore and Lucknow are severely pressed,
and the country between Delhi and Cawnpore
is passing into the hands of the rebels. It is
of the utmost importance to prevent this, and to
relieve Cawnpore; but nothing but rapid action
will do it. Your force of artillery will enable
you to dispose of Delhi with certainty; I there-
fore beg that you will detach one European
infantry regiment and a small force of European
cavalry to the south of Delhi, without keeping
them for operations there, so that Allyghur may
be recovered, and Cawnpore relieved immediately.
It is impossible to over-rate the importance of
<pb n="146"/>
showing European troops between Delhi and
Cawnpore. Lucknow and Allahabad depend
upon it.</q></p>
<p>But Lord Canning did not know when he
wrote this that General Anson had been dead
three days; nor did he conceive that the Mogul
capital was not to be so easily disposed of, for
instead of being entered on June 9, it was not
captured until September 20.</p>
<p>When Philip Heron entered Lord Canning's
room, all this was in the impenetrable future.
June 9 had come and gone, and Delhi had
not been won. The news of General Anson's
death had arrived, and also the intelligence that
not a single man could be spared. Allahabad,
Cawnpore, Lucknow, Benares, were at the mercy
of the native army. The outlook was black, and
little wonder that Lord Canning was depressed.</p>
<p><said>You wish to join Colonel Neill's force?</said>
said he, inquiringly.</p>
<p><said>I want to get to Cawnpore as soon as I can,
your Excellency,</said> replied Heron. <said>I have
pressing reasons.</said></p>
<p><said>If you join the column you must act under
orders. Colonel Neill is to take his men to
Cawnpore. No doubt, if Lucknow is in need of
help, he will send a detachment there; but I
cannot guarantee that you won't be one of the
party. There is such a thing as chance, and
chance just now seems to dominate everything.
It is quite impossible to forecast the future.</said></p>
<p>Heron had to admit the truth of this. Now
that he was face to face with actualities, and
could see that rules, regulations, and routine
<pb n="147"/>
must be thrown aside in view of the terrible
emergencies, it occurred to him that he should
carry out his plan of reaching Cawnpore sooner
if he were not attached to the force regularly.
Might he not volunteer? Lord Canning de-
murred to this.</p>
<p><said>You had better wait till the new Commander-
in-Chief, Sir Patrick Grant, arrives. He should
be here from Madras with Colonel Havelock in
two or three days' time.</said></p>
<p>Philip Heron had never heard of Colonel
Havelock. Few people had in England, beyond
the friends of his family and some of his old Car-
thusian schoolmates. Yet before many weeks
were over, the mere mention of the name of Have-
lock sent a thrill of pride and admiration through
the heart of every one, whether rich or poor, who
heard it.</p>
<p><said>I cannot wait,</said> Heron broke out impatiently.
<said>I have a brother—quite a youngster—in
Cawnpore. I can't explain to your lordship
my strange yearning to see him and . . . but
I mustn't bore you with my private affairs, and
can only beg of you to grant my request.</said></p>
<p>Needless to say that Ruth as well as Dick
was in Phil's mind, and it was his anxiety
concerning her that gave him the eager manner
which impressed Lord Canning, who took a
sheet of paper, wrote a few lines, folded and
placed the paper in an envelope.</p>
<p><said>Take that to Major Stirling, of the 64th.
He may be able to accede to your wishes.</said></p>
<p>Heron warmly thanked the Governor-General,
and hurried away to find Major Stirling. The
<pb n="148"/>
latter had already left his quarters with his men,
and was on the road to the railway station,
Heron hastened after him, and found him in
conference with a grizzled warrior, the grand
old fighting Colonel Walter Hamilton, the com-
mander of the 78th, and better known among
his men as <soCalled>Wattie.</soCalled> Heron waited until the
conversation was over, and then, catching old
Wattie's eye, saluted him. Heron well remem-
bered the veteran in the Crimea. Wattie re-
membered him, too, for his eye sparkled, and
striding towards Heron, clapped him on the
shoulder.</p>
<p><said>I ken ye, laddie. Whaur is't that I've seen
ye?</said></p>
<p><said>The last time we met, Colonel, was just after
Balaclava. I was being carried to the surgeon
when you passed me, and gave me a sup from
your whisky-flask.</said></p>
<p><said>Eh, mon, but ye're richt. Gie me your han'.</said></p>
<p>And the next moment Heron's fingers were
clasped with a force that left them bloodless and
numbed. <soCalled>Wattie</soCalled> was thorough in every-
thing he did.</p>
<p>The encounter was a lucky one, for if Major
Stirling had any scruples about accepting Heron's
services, the latter knew he should have Colonel
Hamilton's good word. And so it proved. The
colonel of the Ross-shire Buffs, as the 78th were
called, introduced him to the Major, and the
matter was arranged.</p>
<p><said>We are off in half an hour,</said> said Major
Stirling. <said>You're ready, I suppose?</said></p>
<p><said>The sooner the better, sir. Yet, with your
<pb n="149"/>
permission, I would like to run to my hotel. It's
close handy. I shall be back in a quarter of an
hour.</said></p>
<p>The Major nodded. Heron did not think of
taking any luggage, but his sword was very
precious. It had served him well on the field
of Balaclava, and to lose it would be like losing
a trusty friend. He rushed to the hotel, secured
his sword, a brace of revolvers, and a brandy-
flask; asked the landlord to take charge of his
portmanteau and trunk, and, if it was his fate
never to return, to dispose of them and their
contents for his own benefit. Then he hastened
to the railway-station.</p>
<p>Heron could only take the clothes in which
he stood upright. They were not suitable for
the climate, consisting as they did of the ordinary
undress uniform of the Hussar regiment to which
he belonged. But in this respect he was no worse
off than the Highlanders, for they fought every
battle of the fierce campaign begarbed in their
woollen doublets.</p>
<p>Heron found the carriages crowded with men,
laughing, talking, and occasionally swearing.
But every now and then a fierce, stern look
crept into their eyes, telling of the wild yearning
in their hearts to avenge the murders at Meerut
and Delhi.</p>
<p>Heron was about to enter a carriage when he
heard his name yelled out. Macintyre, the
Highland red-haired giant, was howling and
gesticulating at him three carriages away.</p>
<p><said>Come in here!</said> he shouted. <said>Shame on
us if we can't find room for a Balaclava boy!</said></p>
<pb n="150"/>
<p>Heron managed to squeeze himself into the
closely packed carriage, and the next minute
was shaking hands right and left. The 78th
and the 64th were mixed up, but, as Macintyre
said, they would be able to sort themselves when
they got to Raneegunge. Some of the officers of
the 64th were in the carriage, and with them
Heron speedily made friends.</p>
<p><said>See that spalpeen of a station-master?</said>
cried Major Tim Cassidy, pointing to an official
who was standing, watch in hand, a little dis-
tance away. <said>It's meself that would like to see
him start the thrain before he has his orders.</said></p>
<p>What had this official done to make himself
so objectionable? Heron soon learnt. When
Colonel Neill and the first detachment of his
<soCalled>Lambs</soCalled> arrived, this official had an idea that
the time-table of the railway company, and not
the suppression of the Mutiny, was the all-
important thing. In a very pompous way he
went to Neill and told him that if his men were
not ready the train must start without them, as
time was up, and the train could not be kept
waiting.</p>
<p><said>Leave me to make my own arrangements,
sir!</said> said Neill sternly. <said>When my men are
in the train the train will start, and not be-
fore!</said></p>
<p><said>Excuse me, Colonel Neill,</said> said the official
pertly, <said>you may command your regiment, but
you don't command the railway!</said></p>
<p>Neill made no reply to the fellow, but beckoned
to a sergeant.</p>
<p><said>Take that man into custody,</said> said he.</p>
<pb n="151"/>
<p>The next moment the astonished railway
official found himself roughly handled by a
couple of <soCalled>the Lambs,</soCalled> and he shrieked aloud
for assistance. Guards, stokers, and porters
came running up eager to help their superior;
but, when they attempted to do so, in a twinkling
they were stuck up against the wall, each with
a man with fixed bayonet standing over him.
And in this way Neill brought the station-master
to reason.</p>
<p>The troops reached Raneegunge by the after-
noon, but here their troubles began. From
Raneegunge the journey would be by the Grand
Trunk Road, which runs from Calcutta to Delhi,
a distance of some nine hundred miles. This
road was made by the East India Company, and
remains one of the few memorials of their at-
tempts to improve the communications of India.</p>
<p>At Raneegunge the energetic transport officer
was doing his best to push on men, stores, and
ammunition; but he had almost a superhuman
task. Had the Company furthered the construc-
tion of railways, how easy it would have been!
But the official minds of the old days cared little
for India. <q>India for the Civil Service,</q> was
their motto. So long as they drew their salaries,
India might take care of itself. Railways, irri-
gation works, improvements of roads, all were
pooh-poohed.</p>
<p>The officials worked like Trojans. Every
available horse and bullock along the line had
been purchased by the Government; every cart
and carriage secured for the conveyance of
troops. The road was one incessant stream of
<pb n="152"/>
traffic—men in all kinds of conveyances, ammu-
nition-wagons, rumbling artillery-trains, drawn
by teams of bullocks, urged on by gesticulating
and yelling drivers; camels and elephants were
also pressed into the service. The river steamers
were carrying men and stores; but they moved
too slowly, for, apart from the windings of the
Ganges, it was the dry season. The stream was
perpetually varying in depth, and there was
constant danger of a vessel grounding on a sand-
bank.</p>
<p>But with all the energy and lavish expenditure
of money, the transport service was miserably
inadequate. The distance between Raneegunge
and Benares could be traversed in five days, it
is true, in a carriage drawn by horses; but how
many men could be thus conveyed? Only
eighteen to twenty-four every day! At this rate
it would take forty-two days to transport 1,000
men to Benares only! How much longer to
Cawnpore and Lucknow? What an answer to
the despairing cry, <q>For God's sake, send us
British troops!</q></p>
<p>So, while horsed carriages were used as much
as possible, the bulk of the relieving force were
dispatched in bullock-wagons, which were able
to take a hundred men a day; and although the
time occupied was double that of the horsed
carriages, yet in the long run they were quicker.
But when Heron saw the long teams of bullocks,
many of them weak and wretchedly underfed,
painfully plodding along the dusty road, one
sometimes falling, and delaying the whole train
of wagons for half an hour and more, he almost
<pb n="153"/>
groaned aloud, for he knew how those imprisoned
at Cawnpore and Lucknow must be wearily
longing for the help which alone could be their
salvation. He ventured to ask Colonel Hamilton
what he thought were the prospects at Cawnpore.</p>
<p><said>Sir Hugh Wheeler is alone worth a thousand
men,</said> said he. And then he added, with Scotch
caution: <said>But I'll nae be sure Sir Hugh wad not
rather ha'e the men.</said></p>
<p>Major Stirling was more communicative.</p>
<p><said>Lord Canning thinks Cawnpore and Luck-
now are safe,</said> said he. <said>I saw Neill's instruc-
tions, and one passage was this, <q>My object is
to place at Sir Hugh Wheeler's disposal a force
with which he can leave his entrenchments at
Cawnpore, and show himself at Lucknow or
elsewhere.</q></said></p>
<p>This dispatch, Heron subsequently learned,
was withdrawn on June 10, at the very moment
when Sir Hugh Wheeler was surrounded by
thousands of black, howling demons, when shot
and shell were crashing through the flimsy de-
fences of his entrenchment, when death was
rapidly diminishing his little force, when the
women and children in his charge were suffering
bodily and mental agony such as it is scarcely
possible for the mind to conceive, much less to
realise.</p>
<p><said>Then,</said> said Heron, <said>we shall first proceed
to Cawnpore?</said></p>
<p><said>Undoubtedly, unless sufficient troops are sent
up to enable us to divide our forces. There's
some talk of a movable column being formed.
If so, I hope the command will be given to the
<pb n="154"/>
man who's daily expected to arrive from Madras
with the new Commander-in-Chief, Sir Patrick
Grant.</said></p>
<p><said>Ah! and who is he?</said></p>
<p><said>Every inch a soldier—Colonel Henry Have-
lock. Ask Colonel Hamilton what he thinks of
Havelock. They were together at Bushire. The
Persian War gave Havelock little to do. It was
over too soon. The Ross-shire Buffs will be
glad to see him. He led them at Mohunera,
where the Persians fled at the sight of our
fellows. Havelock is emphatically the man for
this business. No one understands the science
of war better than he does, no one knows India
so well.</said></p>
<p>Major Stirling's words were prophetic. Within
five days of Philip Heron's departure from
Calcutta, the <name type="vessel" rend="i">Fire Queen</name> brought Sir Patrick
Grant and Havelock into the Hooghly. They
reached Calcutta on June 17, and Sir Patrick
hastened to present Havelock to Lord Canning.
His words of introduction were curt and to the
purpose:</p>
<p><said>Your Excellency, I have brought you the
man,</said> said he. And Lord Canning had the
wisdom to think so, too.</p>
<p>Those few words saved India. But it was not
for many months afterwards that Heron heard
of them. At the moment they were being
uttered he was jogging along in a villainous
conveyance, the springs of which threatened to
break at every jolt, vainly trying to summon a
patience which he knew very well he did not
possess.</p>

<head type="main">The Hand that Fired the Fuse</head>

<p>For some days previous to the first alarm which
sent the frightened residents hurrying into the
entrenchment, Howard Kendrick had been going
from bad to worse, and at the time of the in-
cendiary fires, he was quite oblivious to the
hubbub and confusion in the city. The plan of
shutting himself in his bungalow under the plea
of illness, instead of helping on his scheme of
leaving Cawnpore retarded it. He had drunk
so hard during his solitude that <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Rogers,
easy-going as he was, put his foot down, and
declared that the <soCalled>invalid</soCalled> was not in a fit
state to undertake the long and arduous journey
to Calcutta.</p>
<p>But apart from the effects of continuous
<soCalled>pegs</soCalled> of brandy, something else happened which
kept Kendrick in Cawnpore. It fell to the lot
of Colonel Waring to perform a very unpleasant
duty. This duty arose out of a letter he had
received from Kendrick's father, the East India
Company's director. Had the young man kept
himself sober, he might have got away before
the letter arrived; as it was, it descended upon
him like a thunderbolt.</p>
<pb n="156"/>
<p>Sir Oliver Kendrick's letter reached Colonel
Waring shortly after the retirement on the 21st
from the barracks within the entrenchment, and
when he, with many others, hoped the disturbance
had blown over. In the afternoon of the 24th
his buggy was at Howard Kendrick's bungalow,
and the Colonel, his kindly face unwontedly
stern, alighted. The real cause of Kendrick's
indisposition had oozed out, and Colonel Waring
was well aware what was the matter. But it
was not this which made him stern. So many
officers gave way to drink that an occasional
excess was regarded as a venial fault.</p>
<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Rogers chanced to be with the captain
when Waring called, and the surgeon received
the visitor in the sitting-room.</p>
<p><said>I'm afraid, sir,</said> said he apologetically, <said>that
Captain Kendrick's not in a fit state to carry on
a connected conversation.</said></p>
<p><said>I can judge of that for myself, I presume,</said>
said the old colonel grimly; <said>the business which
has brought me here must be cleared up at
once.</said></p>
<p>Rogers raised no further opposition, but
ushered Waring into the bedroom. The man
on the bed turned his bloodshot eyes on the
unwelcome visitor. A remnant of discipline
still clung to him; the sight of the colonel had a
sobering effect, and he made a strenuous effort
to pull himself together.</p>
<p><said>Au'f'ly good of you to call, sir,</said> he mumbled.</p>
<p><said>Glad you think so, Captain Kendrick. I
won't say what's uppermost in my mind as to
your folly, and the disgraceful example you're
<pb n="157"/>
setting to the youngsters at this time when we
want men who are level-headed, and have some
respect for themselves and the Service, because
I've something more serious to say than to ex-
press my personal opinion of your conduct. I've
had a letter from your father. I hope your
mind's not too muddled to understand its
purport. I'm going to read it to you.</said></p>
<p>These words fell on Howard Kendrick's brain
like little hammers. He raised himself on his
elbow, and glared at the old soldier, who went
on remorselessly from the beginning to the end
of the letter. Sir Oliver, it appeared, had received
a communication from the manager of the bank
at Cawnpore, stating that Captain Kendrick had
considerably overdrawn his account and wishing
to how what was to be done. Sir Oliver had
replied that the bank must take its own course,
as he had washed his hands of his son.</p>
<p><said>I am writing to you to the same effect,</said> the
Colonel went on to read, <said>so that you may
understand Howard's exact position. I see no
reason to alter my resolve, and for the present,
at all events, he must expect no assistance from
me.</said></p>
<p><said>On receiving this letter,</said> continued Colonel
Waring, <said>I called at the bank and inquired
what instructions they had had from Sir Oliver,
and I was told they had heard nothing from him
beyond the reply to their letter, which reply
confirmed what your father has written here.
But</said>—and Colonel Waring's voice took a
deeper note—<said>they informed me that a large
sum had been placed to your credit, and that
<pb n="158"/>
this money had come through Azimoolah Khan.
Its source is evident. The Nana is supplying
you with funds. For what purpose?</said></p>
<p>The Colonel fixed his eyes on Kendrick, whose
lips were nervously twitching in the endeavour
to make some kind of answer.</p>
<p><said>No harm, I s'pose,</said> at last he jerked out,
<said>in . . . Nana lending . . . money. Lots of
our fellows . . . done . . . same thing . . .
borrows.</said></p>
<p><said>If there's no harm, why did you let it be
spread about that you'd made up your differ-
ences with your father? Why did you insinu-
ate he had supplied you with funds? Damn it,
sir, you told a confounded lie.</said></p>
<p>Kendrick could only gaze helplessly at the
irate Colonel. He was unable to say anything.</p>
<p><said>While you've been drinking your brains
away, worries outside have been gathering, and
by George, we've had a narrow escape of a
repetition of Meerut, Delhi, and the latest ter-
rible business at Futtehpore,</said> went on Colonel
Waring.</p>
<p>Kendrick knew nothing of the outbreaks at
these places. He was in a drunken stupor on
the 20th, when the news arrived.</p>
<p><said>Meerut—Delhi? What's been going on
there, sir?</said> mumbled Kendrick.</p>
<p><said>Murder—slaughter—massacre! Don't ask
me. You ought to have known. Look here,
Kendrick, I've only one thing to say to you.
Unless you drop that poison</said>—Colonel Waring
pointed to the brandy bottle—<said>you'll be
cashiered. I leave you to think over it.</said></p>
<pb n="159"/>
<p>The Colonel rose, stiff and uncompromising,
and stalked into the next room, where he gave
Rogers something remarkably like a wigging.
Then he departed, angry, distressed, and puzzled.
Waring was not like Sir Hugh Wheeler; he had
no faith in Nana Sahib, and as for Azimoolah, he
detested him. Ruth had told him everything,
and how she suspected Azimoolah had had a hand
in the attempted assassination of Dick Heron,
and the Colonel agreed with her.</p>
<p><said>I know Azimoolah's record,</said> muttered the
Colonel, as he drove back to his bungalow. <said>He
was nothing but a charity boy. Then he was
a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign>, and afterwards a <foreign xml:lang="hi">munshi</foreign> to
Brigadier Scott, who made him over to Brigadier
Ashburnham, who kicked him out on finding he
had been guilty of bribery and corruption. He's
the knave, and the Nana's the fool. By Jove,
a precious pair. And these are the rascals Ken-
drick's so thick with. What the devil does it
mean?</said></p>
<p>The Colonel might well ask the question, but
not even Howard Kendrick could answer it,
though his conscience might supply the key now
that he knew of the tragedies at Meerut and
Delhi.</p>
<p>Whatever effect the interview may have had
on Kendrick's mind, he paid no heed to his
colonel's warning, and when Rogers next entered
the room he found that his patient had helped
himself to the brandy and had drunk quite half
a tumbler full neat. The spirit had whipped his
flagging nerves for a brief space into something
like action, and he was walking unsteadily about
<pb n="160"/>
the room muttering and gesticulating. The sur-
geon noticed a change had come over the man.
It looked as if a crisis were approaching.</p>
<p><said>Get back to bed,</said> commanded Rogers.</p>
<p><said>Mind your own business. Let me alone,</said>
retorted Kendrick. He stopped his pacing
abruptly, and growled out: <said>What's this busi-
ness at Meerut and Delhi? Why the devil
didn't you tell me?</said></p>
<p>Rogers would have avoided the subject, but
Kendrick insisted upon knowing, and thinking it
might bring the man to a better state of mind
the surgeon related the terrible story. Kendrick
listened moodily, and, to the doctor's surprise,
showed no excitement or even emotion. Rogers
imagined his brain was so enfeebled that he did
not realise the nature of the catastrophe.</p>
<p>This was not the case: cause and effect were
slowly evolving themselves in his mind. Howard
Kendrick's thoughts were black. He saw him-
self as the one who had applied the torch to
the materials which were only too ready for
combustion. It was becoming evident to the
wretched man that whatever were the doubts
that had held the Nana back, they had been
dispelled by the fatal talk which had enriched
him, Howard Kendrick.</p>
<p>Then Kendrick wanted to know what had been
going on in Cawnpore, and Rogers told him how
fires had broken out, that the English residents
had fled in panic to the entrenchment, and how
they had returned when nothing more serious
than the musket shot which wounded Dick
Heron had happened.</p>
<pb n="161"/>
<p>Kendrick made no comment, and Rogers,
thinking he might safely be left, went to call on
another patient. He was absent some hours,
and on his return he found a crowd of excited
sepoys and natives outside Kendrick's bungalow,
and Kendrick himself behaving like a madman.
What had occurred was this: Kendrick, armed
with a musket, had wandered out into the dark-
ness, had been challenged by a cavalry patrol,
and had fired at the man, fortunately missing
him. This untoward circumstance hastened
events. The <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">sowar</foreign> made his complaint; a court-
martial was held on Kendrick, who was ac-
quitted, on the ground of his condition at the
time, and it was held that his musket must have
gone off by accident.</p>
<p>The decision gave mortal offence to the
troopers of the Second Cavalry, who had long
been looked upon as active in the work of dis-
content, and angry mutters were heard that
maybe it wouldn't be very long before <emph>their</emph>
weapons went off by mistake too.</p>
<p>Two days after this Kendrick's body was found
floating in the Ganges Canal.</p>
<p>The consternation the discovery caused was
terrible. Some tried to find comfort in the
supposition that the wretched man had, in a
fit of mania, committed suicide, but the general
feeling was that the curtain was about to rise
upon revolt and bloodshed. Yet up to
May 30 all was calm, and Sir Hugh Wheeler
was so sure he could command the situation,
that he actually passed on to Lucknow a part
of the detachment of the 84th, which had been
<pb n="162"/>
sent from Benares. As rank and file crossed the
bridge and marched towards the capital of
Oudh, there was many a malicious smile on the
faces of the dusky crowd, watching the redcoats
depart.</p>
<p>Early in the evening of June 4 Ruth was
sitting in a corner of the verandah of Colonel
Waring's bungalow, her heart full of dire mis-
giving, when a native stealthily approached,
and slipped a note into her hand. He immedi-
ately glided away.</p>
<p>The note ran thus:—</p>
<p><q>This is the last chance, Miss Armitage. The
lives of the English—men, women, and children
—are numbered, but I can yet save <emph>you</emph>. If
you accept my offer, be at the wall of the entrench-
ment near the road leading to the canal at
nightfall.</q></p>
<p>The note could be from no other than Azi-
moolah; the angry blood rushed to her pale
cheeks, and she crushed the note in her nervous
fingers. She was about to tear the paper into
fragments, when it occurred to her the General
ought to see it. It might convey to him a
warning.</p>
<p>She instantly went to head-quarters. The
General was not there. He had gone to pass
the night, as usual, near his men of the 53rd.
There was no one high in command. Apparently,
some event was near at hand, or why should all
the principal officers be absent? Even Colonel
Waring, though his hurt was not well, was
away.</p>
<pb n="163"/>
<p><said>I dare not take it to the General,</said> said the
old sergeant-major to whom she had spoken.
<said>But I'll get a messenger. Ha! What's this?
Something amiss?</said></p>
<p>A dozen—fifty—a hundred pistol shots were
heard. The reports were not simultaneous, but
came in clusters so to speak. The firing was in
the direction of the quarters of the 2nd Cavalry,
and the next moment was heard the thud, thud
of horses' hoofs, and the shouting of men. Then
a column of fire shot in the air. One loud report
awoke the echoes, and reverberated with sullen
thunder.</p>
<p><said>Great Heavens, what is that?</said> cried
Ruth, tremblingly.</p>
<p><said>The garrison alarm gun, miss. We're in
for it now. The devils have broken loose!</said></p>

<head type="main">The Flight to the Entrenchments</head>

<p>The much-dreaded explosion had come. In a
flash the news had spread that the 2nd Cavalry
had mutinied, and having set fire to the riding-
master's bungalow, had fled, carrying off with
them horses, arms, colours, and the regimental
treasure chest.</p>
<p>Alarmed by the sound of the signal gun
crowds of civilians—men, women and children,
in a pitiable state of fright—came pouring
into the entrenchments for shelter. Up to
this time they had been lodged in tents, in the
soldiers' church of <abbr>St.</abbr> John, and in other build-
ings. Made uneasy by the threatening state of
affairs, they had left their houses and bungalows,
quite a week previous, and had taken up their
quarters as best they could.</p>
<p>Four guns were placed in position inside the
entrenchment, manned by European artillery-
men, who in strange headgear, nightcaps and
wideawakes, and side-arms looked like melo-
dramatic buccaneers. A seething crowd of every
colour, sect, and profession filled up the barracks,
and every five minutes buggies, <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">palki-gharries</foreign>,
vehicles of all sorts, drove up and discharged
<pb n="165"/>
cargoes of writers, tradesmen, and a miscellaneous
mob of every complexion—white and tawny—all
in a state of terror.</p>
<p>Ladies were sitting down at the rough mess
tables in the barracks with their ayahs and
swarms of frightened children; and upon this
scene of scare and crowding the Indian sun
poured down its scorching rays, and the air,
undisturbed by punkah or cooled by wet mats,
was stifling, foetid, intolerable.</p>
<p>Through all the scene of confusion, and
despite the gathering fears of the women, the
brave old General was cheery and calm. Yet
even he had come to the conclusion that the
danger could not be averted. The crowding
of the Europeans into the entrenchment had
increased the distrust of the sepoys. Con-
fidence was at an end.</p>
<p>The barracks, simply a long building with a
thatched roof and a verandah, situated at the
south-west corner of the entrenchment, became
terribly crowded, and the scene was very painful.
Every one was full of dire apprehensions as to
what was about to happen, and it was this
ignorance of the future and the vague presenti-
ment of coming evil which made the suspense
so agonising.</p>
<p>Men held their wives' hands, and tried to
whisper words of comfort and hope; women
clasped their weeping children to their bosoms,
and soothed their fears. The only portion of
happy humanity in that seething multitude
were the babies, who smiled in their mothers'
frightened eyes in all the happiness of ignorance
<pb n="166"/>
and innocence. In the midst of this distress
came the sound of distant musketry and artillery,
while the pale dawn was heralded by a crimson
light in the direction of the 2nd Cavalry lines
in the south, where barracks and bungalows were
blazing.</p>
<p>When Ruth returned to the thatched barrack
from the General's quarters, she found the little
space near the verandah which had been assigned
to her, invaded by two ladies and their children.</p>
<p><said>We are are so sorry to inconvenience you,</said>
said one of the ladies apologetically, <said>but we
don't know where to go, and——</said> a sob stopped
her utterance.</p>
<p><said>You need not be sorry,</said> said Ruth gently,
<said>we must do our best to share each other's
burdens. Have you just come?</said></p>
<p><said>About an hour ago. We had arranged for
carriages, but hearing of the outbreak of the
cavalry, we thought they might stop us, and so
we walked. This is my sister</said>—pointing to
the other lady—<said>and my husband is somewhere
about. These are my children. We were very
frightened when we got to the canal bridge, for
we saw a number of sepoys armed with muskets,
apparently lying in wait for somebody. On
seeing us, some pretended to be washing their
hands, and others drinking water, but all looked
quite confused. It was terribly alarming, for
the place was very solitary, and it was almost
dark. We turned and ran, and got to the
entrenchment by a roundabout road, and we
are very thankful indeed we reached here
safely.</said></p>
<pb n="167"/>
<p><said>And you know nothing of what has hap-
pened?</said></p>
<p><said>No; we only heard the guns firing.</said></p>
<p>Ruth did her best to comfort the agitated
women, but it was not much that she could do.
She was oppressed by a terrible feeling of help-
lessness, and how that terrible night of suspense
passed, she scarcely knew. However, in spite
of the suffocating heat, her anxiety, and the
distress around her, fatigue at last overcame
her, and she fell into an uneasy slumber.</p>
<p>The sun was already hot when she was awak-
ened the tramp of footsteps on the verandah.
Half a dozen soldiers were bringing in an im-
provised ambulance of bamboo, on which was
lying a grey-bearded native soldier, his head
enveloped in bandages. The wounded man,
Ruth was afterwards told, was the gallant old
soubadah-major of the mutinous 2nd Cavalry
—the solitary instance of any native belonging
to that regiment who retained his fidelity. When
the men broke out, they ordered him to accom-
pany them on pain of immediate death. The
faithful old fellow steadily refused, and said he
would neither go with them himself, nor sanction
their doing so. The ringleaders then fell upon
him, and he defended the colours of the treasure
which were in the quarter-guard as long as he
could, and at last fell covered with wounds.
The fellows left him for dead, but when found
by our men, he was still alive, and brought into
the entrenchment, where he died after a few
days.</p>
<p>All that morning the women and children were
<pb n="168"/>
huddled together, not one daring to go out.
The heat was intense, and the punkah which was
rigged up did not seem to make much difference
The musketry firing continued for some hours,
and then was suddenly succeeded by the sullen
boom of artillery. What did this portend—
victory or further disaster? Who could tell?</p>
<p>At ten o'clock there was a terrible scare inside
the barrack. It was the first shot fired by the
mutineers at the entrenchment. It came from
a nine-pounder on the north-west, struck the
mud wall, and glided out into the barrack. A
large party of ladies and children were at the
time outside, and the consternation was indescrib-
able. The bugle call sent every man instantly
to his post, many of them carrying in their
ears for the first time the peculiar whizzing of
round shot, with which they were soon to
become familiar.</p>
<p>The intention of the mutineers was probably
to unsteady the nerves of those within the en-
trenchment—a favourite method in the East of
preparing for an attack—for in a short time
the artillery fire ceased, and a group of officers
were seen approaching the barrack. Among
them, Ruth recognised Colonel Waring. She
could not restrain her impatience. She knew
he would be longing to be assured of her safety,
and heedless of the blazing sun, she ran across
the compound to meet him. He took both her
hands and kissed her.</p>
<p><said>Cheer up, my dear girl,</said> whispered the old
colonel. <said>At least we have not been taken
by surprise. We know now our friends from
<pb n="169"/>
foes. We shall hold our own, never fear. Come
into the shade. I don't want my Ruth to have
<choice><reg>sunstroke</reg><orig>sun-stroke</orig></choice>.</said></p>
<p>They entered the verandah, and were immedi-
ately surrounded by an anxious crowd, eager to
hear the tidings.</p>
<p>It seemed that an hour or two after the flight
of the cavalry the 1st Native Infantry also
bolted, leaving their officers untouched upon the
parade ground. Indeed, before going away they
begged of their officers (who, like those of the
other regiments, had for some time been in the
habit of sleeping in the quarter-guard) to leave
them. As to the two other regiments—the 53rd
and the 56th—what had precisely happened was
not very clear. The accounts differed.</p>
<p><said>It was like this,</said> said a young officer. <said>At
seven o'clock this morning Major Lampson,
Captain Attnell, and Captain Lawford rode out
after the beggars, who had gone off to recon-
noitre, and Ashe's battery was ordered to pursue.
They got as far as the canal, when suddenly
came an order for the guns to be brought back,
as it looked as if the 53rd and 56th were about
to break out. Whether that was so or not, I
cannot tell. Anyhow, I know that the 56th
went off, and that about half-past nine nearly
the whole of the native commissioned officers of
the 53rd reported to Sir Hugh that their remon-
strances were no good. The men were deter-
mined to go. Then the General ordered Ashe's
battery to open fire on them. I don't see what
else he could have done,</said> added the speaker, in
an apologetic tone.</p>
<pb n="170"/>
<p><said>It was a mistake—a horrible mistake!</said> ex-
claimed Colonel Waring, with emphasis, <said>and a
mistake for which we may suffer bitterly. The
General was misinformed. The men were peace-
fully occupied in their lines cooking; no signs
of mutiny had appeared in their ranks; they had
refused all the solicitations of the deserters to
accompany them, and seemed quite steadfast,
when Ashe's battery opened fire upon them by
Sir Hugh Wheeler's command, and they were
literally driven from us by nine-pounders. It
was inexcusable.</said></p>
<p><said>Well sir, I can't say anything about that.
The officers of the 53rd are certainly all right,
and they've been ordered to occupy the Artillery
Hospital for the present,</said> said the young fellow.</p>
<p>All that day carts were going and coming,
laden with the baggage of those who had taken
refuge in the entrenchment. Every now and
then a fresh blaze showed where the mutineers
had set fire to a bungalow; but up to this time,
with the exception of the murderous outrage on
the soubadah-major, they had not taken the
life of any one—certainly of no English person.
At least those in the entrenchment were con-
gratulating themselves that this was the case.
That very afternoon they were undeceived.</p>
<p>About two o'clock the corpse of a European
was brought into the entrenchment in a cart by
some natives, and it was at once recognised as
that of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murphy, of the East Indian Railway.
The poor fellow had started to go to his bungalow
on the railway line, and seeing some mutineers
in the distance, shouted for his horse to be
<pb n="171"/>
brought. He mounted, and galloped towards
the entrenchment; but a volley was fired, and
he was shot in the back and head.</p>
<p>After this there could be no mistaking the
intentions of the mutineers, and within a few
minutes the bugle was heard sounding the
assembly for a general muster in the open space
in front of the thatched barrack. Hither
hurried all the men, civil as well as military,
every one indeed, within the entrenchment capa-
ble of bearing arms. They were divided into
sections, and officers appointed, and then arms
and ammunition were served out from a pile of
weapons brought away from the sepoy lines.</p>
<p>Danger was rapidly approaching, and it was
clear that the handful of Englishmen would soon
be fighting for their lives, and for the lives of
those most dear to them, the news coming that
evening that the native artillery attached to Ashe's
Oudh Horse Battery had become mutinous. The
men who belonged to this battery, after being
disarmed, were turned out of the entrenchment.</p>
<p>Just before night came on sentries were ap-
pointed, and the new military part of the garrison
who had just been enrolled took their turn in
the trenches. Hours of intense anxiety were
passed, but nothing happened to cause alarm.
All that the sentries had to report was the con-
tinual burning of bungalows in every direction.</p>
<p>The next morning was June 7, and great
excitement was caused by the arrival of a
messenger from the Nana. He was at once
taken to General Wheeler. The old General, who
spoke Hindustani as fluently as he spoke Eng-
<pb n="172"/>
lish, received the man coldly, hardly acknow-
ledging his low salaam. The two presented a
remarkable contrast—the white-headed, some-
what diminutive (Sir Hugh Wheeler was a little
man) English soldier, upright as a dart, and the
cringing, dusky Oriental, who happened to be
above the average stature of the Hindoo.</p>
<p><said>Well?</said> said the General stiffly, <said>and what
says Seereek Dhoondoo Punth?</said></p>
<p>It was significant of the General's feelings that
he no longer used the Nana's courtesy title but
called him by his real name.</p>
<p><said>I have a letter from the Maharajah,</said> said
the man, bending low.</p>
<p>General Wheeler broke the seal, and as he read
his brows contracted till the white eyebrows
stood out stiff and bushy. The man slyly
watched the General's face, and after a long
pause, said obsequiously:</p>
<p><said>What answer am I to convey to his High-
ness?</said></p>
<p><said>There is no answer! Go!</said> was the stern
reply. <said>Burdon,</said> he added rapidly, in Eng-
lish, to a young lieutenant who was acting as
his secretary, <said>hurry this fellow away. He
may want to delay and spy out our defences.
When he is gone, summon all the officers here.</said></p>
<p>Within five minutes the General was sur-
rounded by a group of resolute men, every one
of whom he could trust to the last drop of their
blood.</p>
<p><said>Gentlemen,</said> said Sir Hugh curtly. <said>I
have just received this letter from the Nana, in
which he is good enough to express his intention
<pb n="173"/>
of attacking us at once. You are Englishmen
and know what to do. I need say no more.</said></p>
<p><said>The infamous traitor,</said> shouted Colonel
Waring.</p>
<p>The old General shrugged his shoulders and
made no reply. No one had believed more in
the honesty of the Nana than General Wheeler.
Doubts had been thrown on the fidelity of the
Mahratta, and Sir Hugh had even been warned
against him; but alas! with no effect.</p>
<p>It was no use wasting time over vain regrets,
and the General at once proceeded to discuss the
best way of utilising the little force at his dis-
posal. Meanwhile native messengers who could
be relied upon were dispatched in hot haste to
the cantonments to bring in those officers who
had not yet vacated their houses. Not a minute
was lost in obeying the order. Goods and
chattels of every kind were left to fall a prey to
the rebel sepoys and <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">goojurs</foreign>, who, after appro-
priating everything they fancied, set fire to the
bungalows.</p>
<p>The day was Sunday, and the thoughts of all
went to peaceful England. The poor women
could in imagination hear the church bells
ringing, and tears filled their eyes.</p>
<p>What kind of place was it that these doomed
men, women, and children—numbering in all
about a thousand souls, of whom 225 were
women, and 320 children—had gathered in for
protection? It consisted of two long hospital
barracks, one (already mentioned) with a
thatched roof, and the other wholly of masonry.
They were single-storied buildings, with ver-
<pb n="174"/>
andahs running round them, and with the usual
outhouses attached. These two buildings were
some 120 <abbr>ft.</abbr> apart, and between them was a
well, the only source of water-supply, wholly
unprotected from the fire of the enemy.</p>
<p>The shape of the entrenchment was, roughly
speaking, an oblong of about 800 <abbr>ft.</abbr> by 500 <abbr>ft.</abbr>
enclosing the two barracks, and consisted simply
of a mud wall, at no place higher than 4 <abbr>ft.</abbr>,
and not even bullet proof at the crest, for the
scorching sun had crumbled the surface to
powder. The apertures for the artillery ex-
posed both the guns and the gunners, whilst an
enemy in the buildings adjacent to the earth-
works outside could find ample cover.</p>
<p>Around the entrenchment the guns were
placed, three on the north-east and three on the
south, to range the plain which separated the
officers' cantonments from the city. A small
three-pounder which had been rifled some time
before, was also placed in position; but it could
only be used for grape, as there was no conical
shot in store. In addition, there was Lieutenant
Ashe's half-battery of horse artillery, consisting
of two nine-pounders and a twenty-four pounder
howitzer. These ten guns were all the artillery
which could be brought to the position, and they
constituted the garrison's sole means of defence
by artillery, the poor little mud wall being the
only bulwark. Ammunition was plentiful, there
being in the field magazines two thousand
pounds of powder, with ball cartridges and round
shot in abundance.</p>
<p>At half-past ten on this day, June 8, the
<pb n="175"/>
enemy opened fire, and the bugle inside the en-
trenchment sounded <q>All hands to arms!</q>
Immediately every man proceeded to the earth-
works, and nearly all day, exposed to the hot
winds and scorching rays of the fierce Indian
sun, awaited the attack of the foe. There was a
difference of opinion as to when this attack
would come. No one knew if the rebels had
any recognised leaders, and without leaders the
native troops would not be very eager to try
conclusions with their late masters.</p>
<p><said>They haven't got the pluck to come on by
themselves,</said> cried Dick, who with an Enfield
was making good practice at the dusky figures
moving about, as they imagined, out of range
of the rifles.</p>
<p><said>That was a good shot of yours, Heron.
It's sent the cowards to the shelter of that
building. Look how they're running! Mind
that round shot, it's coming our way. Move,
McQuin,</said> shouted Colonel Waring to a gunner
who was standing close by.</p>
<p>The man evidently saw the shot, but he stood
rooted to the spot in a kind of fatal fascination.
He could have got away, but he did not attempt
to do so, and he was killed instantly. This was
the first death within the entrenchment.</p>
<p>As the day advanced, the fire of the enemy
grew hotter, and the range better, but only a
few balls struck the barracks. But few as they
were, they caused the utmost tenor. All through
that terrifying day the shrieks of the women
and children were heard, and their wailings were
at times <choice><reg>heart-rending</reg><orig>heartrending</orig></choice>; but after the initiation
<pb n="176"/>
of the first day, they learned silence, and never
uttered a sound, except when groaning from the
horrible pain and suffering they had to endure.</p>
<p>No musketry was fired by the sepoys for
some hours. The idea evidently was to batter
down the earthworks first, and this they thought
would not take long. Here they were totally
mistaken. They did not know the bulldog
tenacity of the British. When night fell, how-
ever, incessant volleys of musketry began.
Rest was utterly impossible. Waiting the as-
sault supposed to be impending, not a man
closed his eyes in sleep, and throughout the
whole siege snatches of troubled slumber under
the cover of the wall constituted the sole relief
the poor weary men could obtain. It was still
worse for the women, who, shut up in the stifling
barracks, could only endure; and endure they
did, with a patience and courage that have rarely
been equalled and never surpassed.</p>
<p>When morning broke on the second day, it
revealed a terribly painful sight in the groups
of jaded women and children, many of them so
wan and helpless in appearance as almost to
suggest death itself. A few were lying on
mattresses, others were on rugs and mats, but
many had nothing but the bare boards to rest
upon.</p>
<p>Ruth shared her corner with the two ladies
and the children already mentioned and, like
the others, scarcely slept for five consecutive
minutes. Apart from the rattle of muskets,
the moaning of the children, who suffered in-
tensely with thirst, was enough to keep her
<pb n="177"/>
awake. When she saw the little ones, with
large, staring, tearful eyes and flushed cheeks,
crying vainly for water to cool their parched
throats, her heart went out to them in pity.</p>
<p><said>I will see what can be done,</said> said she.
<said>Where is Dhoolah Singh?</said></p>
<p>She went in search of this man, who was one
of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Waring's servants. He was not to be
found—nor were any of the others. All the
servants had slipped away during the night.
The commencement of hostilities was sufficient
for them.</p>
<p>Thrown on her own resources, Ruth tried to
find a water vessel not exhausted, but she failed.
All the skins for containing water were empty,
and so were the buckets.</p>
<p><said>This is terrible!</said> she said to a tall, stout,
good-natured woman named Widdowson, the
wife of a private in the 32nd Regiment, who
afterwards distinguished herself in a remarkable
way. <said>The poor little dears are parched, and
they won't believe me when I tell them there's
no water.</said></p>
<p><said>My God!</said> cried the woman. <said>They'd be
a good deal happier if they were dead. It's hard
to see 'em suffer so.</said></p>
<p><said>Where's the well?</said> asked Ruth suddenly.</p>
<p><said>Over yonder, just in front of the barracks
—worse luck.</said></p>
<p>It was about a hundred feet away, and exposed
to the fire of the enemy.</p>
<p><said>Give me a bucket. I'll go and get some
water.</said></p>
<p><said>You!</said> exclaimed the horrified woman.
<pb n="178"/>
<said>Why, my dear, good young lady, it's as much
as your life is worth.</said></p>
<p><said>Some one must do it,</said> said Ruth desper-
ately.</p>
<p>The woman would have detained her, but
Ruth was too quick. Seizing a bucket, she
threaded her way amidst the groups of recum-
bent figures, and reached the verandah. For
one instant she paused. With the dawn, the
sepoy artillery had reopened fire. The aim was
very bad, but this in no way lessened her risk.
As Ruth stood hesitating, a round shot passed
close to the well. Had she been drawing water
at the time, it must have killed her.</p>
<p>Then it occurred to her that the chances were
against a shot going over that precise spot a
second time, within a few minutes, and without
waiting another instant, she dashed forward,
and reached the well in safety, returning with a
bucket full of water. It was a daring deed,
and one she was never permitted to repeat.</p>

<p>For two days General Wheeler's stronghold
had been besieged. The Nana imagined that a
couple of hours' sharp firing, with heavy guns,
would destroy the British garrison, and entire
possession of the entrenchment would follow.
So impressed was he with the idea of his in-
vincibility, that he made a vow not to alight
from his horse until the English had surrendered!</p>
<p>He was convinced of his mistake on the very
first day; and when evening arrived, and no sign
appeared of defeat or surrender, he was obliged
to descend from the saddle; and ordering a
carpet to be spread in a deep ditch near one of
his batteries, there he passed the night. On
the following morning, finding little or no hope
of success, he removed into Duncan's Hotel,
about three quarters of a mile from the en-
trenchment, and on the outskirts of the native
city.</p>
<p>To the besieged it was soon evident the ques-
tion of the commissariat would speedily become
one of vital importance. Either in consequence
of the deception of the native agents who had
been engaged to send in supplies, or because
<pb n="180"/>
Sir Hugh Wheeler had only arranged for the
support of the military, the stock of provisions
was ridiculously insufficient.</p>
<p>Nor was this the worst oversight. The place
of storage for the casks of beer which had been
brought in was so unfortunately selected that
within twenty-four hours the greater part of
these casks were tapped by the enemy's shot,
and deep were the lamentations of the men at
the loss of so much valuable liquor. While the
dainties, tinned and otherwise, lasted they were
equally divided without regard to rank; and
odd indeed was the assortment which went to
make up each one's allowance.</p>
<p><said>What's the bill o' fare to-day?</said> asked a
private meeting a comrade coming from the
stores, where Captain Williamson had been
serving out the rations.</p>
<p><said>I'm in luck, laddie—a mug o' champagne,
a tin o' preserved 'errings, an' half a pot o' jam,</said>
said Tommy.</p>
<p><said>My! I hope as how that'll be my luck too.</said></p>
<p>But this was not possible. However, Tommy's
comrade did very well with tinned salmon, rum,
and a box of sweetmeats. The first two he kept
for himself, and the third he gave to the children,
and piteous it was to see the poor little things
trying to make themselves happy, while shots
every now and then crashed through the frail
walls of the barracks, and the hideous sounds of
bursting shells and volleys of musketry drowned
their feeble voices.</p>
<p>The mixed and luxurious fare soon came to
an end. After the dainties were exhausted,
<pb n="181"/>
the rice and flour were reserved for the women
and children, and soon even these were reduced
to the monotonous and scanty allowance of one
meal a day, consisting of a handful of split peas
and a handful of flour—scarcely more than half
a pint together for a daily ration.</p>
<p>On this scanty fare the devoted little band of
defenders had to perform incessant labour under
a tropical sun, in the hottest part of the day.
Many of the civilians had never been accustomed
to go out in the hot winds, except in a covered
conveyance, and they suffered severely when on
sentry duty, some covering up their heads
with cloths dipped in water, others putting up a
temporary shelter of empty boxes, sheets, baskets,
or anything their ingenuity could suggest.</p>
<p>The first three days were terrible. Fatalities
were numerous, and a portion of the thatched
barrack was transformed into a hospital, and
thither the dead and dying were carried. The
women were never tiring in their attentions to
those who were struck down, and the surgeons
worked incessantly, but their means and appli-
ances were very limited, and the small stock
of linen clothing was speedily reduced in sup-
plying bandages.</p>
<p>It is impossible to imagine the terrible effect
the sudden bursting of large shells in the
verandah, and elsewhere in close proximity to
the barracks, had upon the tenderly reared
ladies and children. In one or two cases the shock
was so great as actually to cause death. The
casualties were as appalling as they were un-
expected. On the third day of the firing, seven
<pb n="182"/>
servants took shelter under the verandah.
They were leaning against the wall, when a shell
falling outside bounded in their midst, and burst
with tremendous effect, causing instant death to
five, and wounding the sixth. The seventh
escaped unhurt.</p>
<p>What added to the horror was that the dead
had to remain unburied until the night. No
one dared to perform the last offices to loved
ones and friends in the daytime, when a continual
shower of shot and shell and a hailstorm of
bullets were pouring over the devoted place.</p>
<p>Sadly and silently were these funerals per-
formed. At first the mourners attempted to
dig graves, but they soon abandoned the task;
there had been no rain for months, the ground
was too hard, and there was great danger of
being shot, for at intervals all through the night
came harassing volleys of musketry, fired as
much with the idea of destroying rest as with
the intention of killing.</p>
<p>So, after a time, outside the mud wall of the
entrenchment, and near a block of unfinished
barracks, an enclosure was parted off and con-
verted into a cemetery, and there within three
weeks were laid two hundred and fifty men,
women, and children. Sad was their fate, but
at least it was a happier one than that of those
they left behind.</p>
<p>On the fourth day of the siege Ruth was
coming from the hospital, where she had been
doing her best to tend the wounded. She was
weary and worn, and the effect of semi-starvation
was asserting itself in her face, which had already
<pb n="183"/>
lost its roundness. Two little children—orphans
of but twelve hours' date, the father a private,
having been killed by a musket ball, and the
mother having died of sunstroke—came running
towards her. They were crying bitterly. She
took the youngest, a curly-headed boy of four,
in her arms and kissed and soothed him.</p>
<p>The heat and the foul atmosphere of the interior
of the barracks were unbearable, and she stepped
into the verandah with the child in her arms.
The enemy's fire was at that moment directed
towards the other side of the entrenchment.
She could just see over the low wall, and while
looking she was startled by an unexpected sight
—an English officer galloping over the plain
near the sepoy lines!</p>
<p>Hope sprang within her heart. Surely this
solitary horseman must be the pioneer of a
relieving force. She darted into the barrack wild
with excitement.</p>
<p><said>They're coming! They're coming!</said> she
cried.</p>
<p>At first the poor women thought she was
alluding to the sepoys, and they shrank back in
terror; but a second look at her radiant face
reassured them.</p>
<p><said>Our soldiers are coming!</said> she gasped.
<said>We're saved! saved!</said></p>
<p>She returned to the verandah followed by a
group of excited women, and they too, saw the
single horseman, and, breathless with excitement,
watched him run the gauntlet of a deadly fire.
He bore a charmed life, for not a bullet touched
him. But where was the advancing force whose
<pb n="184"/>
approach he was supposed to be heralding?
Not a man was to be seen.</p>
<p>The sepoys at a distance yelled and screamed
and fired at random, but they dared not pursue
the daring rider. They had a wholesome fear
of the accuracy of the fire from behind the en-
trenchment's rampart.</p>
<p>Urging on his exhausted horse, the gallant
soldier rode straight as an arrow towards the
entrenchment, and a loud hurrah burst from a
hundred English throats as the animal made its
final effort, and, clearing the wall, fell a struggling
heap of man and horse the other side. A dozen
volunteers, Dick Heron among the number,
heedless of sepoy bullets, rushed to the assistance
of the fugitive.</p>
<p><said>My God, Bolton, is it you?</said> cried Dick,
grasping both hands.</p>
<p>The two were old comrades. Bolton was a
lieutenant in the 7th Cavalry, which had been
encamped at Choubeypore, a few miles to the
north-west of Cawnpore.</p>
<p>Bolton shook himself free from his stirrups
and struggled to his feet, but he was too ex-
hausted either to speak or walk. He looked like
a man who had seen unspeakable things. He
was assisted into the barracks, and taken to
General Wheeler's quarters. A little brandy—
there was not much left in the medical stores
—revived him. The old white-headed General
looked sadly enough at the young officer.</p>
<p><said>You bring bad news, Bolton. I can read
disaster in your face,</said> said General Wheeler.</p>
<p><said>Disaster indeed, sir. The 7th have mutinied
<pb n="185"/>
and murdered all their officers. I alone have
escaped.</said></p>
<p>Bolton's voice was low and stern. He seemed
to speak with difficulty. The tones were hollow
and broken. The memory of the scenes he had
witnessed was at that moment too vivid for
description. Nor did General Wheeler ask for
details. When death was all around what did
it matter how others died? The old man's hands
were clenched tightly. It was the only sign of
emotion he showed. Presently he said, in an
ordinary voice and maimer, as though he were
asking the time of day:</p>
<p><said>When did this happen?</said></p>
<p><said>Yesterday evening. I've been riding all
night. I found all the main roads blocked by
rebels, but I reached the city somehow, and there
heard a worse story than that of the deaths of
my poor comrades. Three boats with some
thirty men, the same number of ladies, and
about sixty children, arrived the day before
yesterday from Futteghur. They had not heard
what had happened at Cawnpore, and they hoped
to find shelter here.</said></p>
<p><said>Shelter in Cawnpore!</said> muttered the gen-
eral with a groan, <said>Poor creatures! poor
creatures!</said></p>
<p><said>It's too awful for words,</said> returned Bolton,
his voice quivering. <said>They got to within a
mile of the magazine, when the boats grounded.
The cowardly fiends opened fire upon them, and
the fugitives rushed for protection into the long
grass on the banks of the river. The wretches
then set fire to the grass, and two of the ladies
<pb n="186"/>
and some of the children were burnt to death.
What could the rest do but surrender?</said></p>
<p><said>And then?</said></p>
<p>The old General spoke almost mechanically;
his lips twitched for an instant, then were firm
once more.</p>
<p><said>And then—my God, it's too horrible to
think! The men were bound together and
driven like a flock of sheep to the slaughter. The
women and children, many of them without
shoes, dragged themselves along with cut and
bleeding feet. No food was given them, and
very little water. Yesterday they were taken
before the Nana, and some say that the villain
was inclined to show mercy, but that his brother
Bala and the troopers of the 2nd Cavalry were
thirsting for blood. However this may be, at
three o'clock yesterday afternoon the captive
men, women, and children were driven into a
heap, and this devil Bala sat upon a big stone in
the plain, and gave the word to fire. After dis-
charging two rounds of shot the wretches fell
upon the poor victims with swords and bayonets,
and completed the slaughter.</said></p>
<p>The two men, one full of years, the other just
past the threshold of manhood, looked at each
other. The fire of righteous vengeance flashed in
the eyes of both. The General brought down his
hand heavily upon the little table in front of him.</p>
<p><said>If I am spared,</said> he cried, <said>if—but it is
a waste of words to say what one would do with
these human tigers. What happened to the poor
souls from Futteghur yesterday may happen
to us to-morrow. Bolton,</said> said he, suddenly
<pb n="187"/>
breaking off, <said>not a word of this massacre to
any one. It mustn't get to the ears of the
women. They've behaved nobly. One would
expect nothing else from English women.
Heaven alone knows their terrible trials, their
anguish of mind, their agony of body. Don't
let us add a single pang to their misery.</said></p>
<p><said>You may depend upon me, sir,</said> cried the
young lieutenant with emphasis.</p>
<p>At that moment a step was heard outside the
door of the little room set apart for the use of
General Wheeler; and Captain Moore, one of
the many heroic men who fought like lions
throughout that terrible time till death overtook
them, entered. His face and hands were dirt-
begrimed, his beard was of a week's growth, his
clothes were soiled and tattered, one of his arms
was in a sling.</p>
<p><said>What is it, Moore?</said> asked Sir Hugh.</p>
<p><said>It's getting too hot in barrack <abbr>No.</abbr> 4, sir.
Heberden, Latouche, and Miller are doing splen-
did work, but it is wearing them out. The black
devils dare not show themselves, but they're
only waiting their time. We ought to spare a
dozen men for barrack <abbr>No.</abbr> 4.</said></p>
<p><said>Can we do it?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, sir. Captain Jenkins is ready with a
detachment. You've only to say the word.
The barrack ought to be held at all costs.</said></p>
<p><said>Very well, Moore. Let the men go.</said></p>
<p>These barracks, of which <abbr>No.</abbr> 4—referred to
by Captain Moore—was one, played a very
important part in the defence of the entrench-
ment. They consisted of a series of nine un-
<pb n="188"/>
finished detached buildings intended for the
accommodation of the native infantry. They
were in course of erection when the siege began,
and were of red brick, each being about 200 <abbr>ft.</abbr>
in length. They were situated outside the en-
trenchment, and ran in a line nearly north and
south.</p>
<p>Of these buildings only one—<abbr>No.</abbr> 4—had a roof,
and that was only of a temporary character.
None of them had any floor, and heaps of bricks
and building materials were strewn about.
Captain Moore saw the importance of these
barracks when the construction of the entrench-
ment was commenced, and before a shot was
fired took possession of them. Commanding the
entrenchment as they did, they afforded ad-
mirable cover for an enemy, who from a shelter
could harass the besieged from innumerable
loopholes, and be themselves in perfect safety.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the force at General Wheeler's
disposal was not large enough to allow the whole
of these barracks to be occupied. Only two
could be held, and the rest fell into the hands of
the rebels. The two exceptions were <abbr>Nos.</abbr> 2
and 4. <abbr>No.</abbr> 4 was defended by the three gallant
men just mentioned, Heberden, Latouche, and
Miller, railway engineers and surveyors; and
valiantly these brave fellows fought, though
their first (and last) military experience was
here. Their profession had sharpened their
sight; they were admirable judges of distance,
and they never raised their rifles but a sepoy
bit the dust.</p>
<p><abbr>No.</abbr> 2 was under the charge of Captain Mow-
<pb n="189"/>
bray Thomson, destined to be one of the sur-
vivors of the heroic garrison. He had erected a
sort of crow's nest inside the barrack with the
building materials he found, and here a man
was stationed, who, as soon as he saw any sign
of movement among the sepoys in <abbr>No.</abbr> 1 barrack,
gave the signal to his comrades below, and any
sepoy who ventured out never went back.
Captain Stirling, a splendid shot, never missed
his man, and from first to last must have killed
many scores of the enemy.</p>
<p>The task of relieving barrack <abbr>No.</abbr> 4 was one of
great difficulty, and attended with considerable
danger, quite two hundred yards separating the
barrack from the rampart of the entrenchment.
Captain Jenkins got his men together, and they
were about to dash across the intervening space,
when a shell burst near them, and so terribly
wounded one poor fellow that he died the same
evening. Dick Heron volunteered to fill the
man's place.</p>
<p>Captain Jenkins looked at Dick's thin, eager
face, pale, delicate, more boyish than ever, and
hesitated.</p>
<p><said>Do you realise what this means, Heron?</said>
said he. <said>You may never come back.</said></p>
<p><said>I can take my chance with the rest, I sup-
pose,</said> returned Dick. <said>It's not much more
dangerous than staying here.</said></p>
<p><said>That's true. Very well, I'll take you.</said></p>
<p>In one sense the delay caused by the bursting
shell, apart from the loss of a valuable man, was
fortunate. It was discovered that by an over-
sight sufficient ammunition had not been served
<pb n="190"/>
out. It was intended that each man should
have as much as he could carry. This was very
important, for there was no store in the barrack,
and when the defenders were short of cartridges,
a man had to run across to the entrenchment and
take the chance of being shot on the way.</p>
<p>The serving out of the ammunition was likely
to take some little time, and while it was being
done Dick glanced at the thatched barrack
where the women were lodged. He had an
intense longing to see Ruth Armitage before he
set out. If he were never to see her again!
He could not resist the impulse, and dashed
across to the verandah. He had caught sight
of her as she was about to enter the barrack.
When he reached her, he saw she had been
crying.</p>
<p><said>Good-bye, Miss—no, I can't call you Miss
Armitage. It's Ruth now, isn't it?</said></p>
<p>He held out his hand and she took it a little
shyly.</p>
<p><said>Good-bye?</said> said she, ignoring his words
about calling her by her Christian name. <said>Where
are you going?</said></p>
<p><said>Across to <abbr>No.</abbr> 4 barrack. I thought that
you—that I might—dash it all, I can't say what
I want to say! Ah, how cruel it all is!</said></p>
<p>A look of pain and despair crept into the eyes
of the poor young fellow. When death came, it
would be sweeter if he were to die with the girl
he loved; and this was what he wanted to tell
her. Ruth could say nothing. She knew that
he loved her, and she was very sorry for him.</p>
<p>Dick held Ruth's hand tightly. He wanted
<pb n="191"/>
to remember that clasp. At that moment life
was divided from death by a thread, which
might snap without warning: there was no time
for emotion, and his voice was quite steady when
he next spoke.</p>
<p><said>I may never see you again, Ruth. That's
why I said good-bye.</said></p>
<p>Ruth was not so calm as he. Dick felt her
hand go cold as ice.</p>
<p><said>You are better off than we are,</said> she stam-
mered. <said>At least you will die fighting, but we
poor women——</said></p>
<p>Something seemed to rise in her throat and
choke her utterance. It was much the same
with Dick. The two were silent for a few
seconds, and during those few seconds the
horrors around them were unseen, the boom of
shot and shell, the crack of bullets were unheard.
The moments were flying; soon he must tear
himself away. Dick forced himself to speak.</p>
<p><said>I want to ask a favour of you,</said> he went on
huskily. <said>May I have something of yours—I
don't care how trifling—to cheer me? I'm a
stupid fool, I know, and I suppose if things were
different from what they are, it would be no good
telling you that—that—Heaven help me, I can't
keep it to myself any longer—I love you. There,
it's out! Don't be angry with me.</said></p>
<p><said>Angry?</said> faltered Ruth. <said>Why should I
be angry? What does it matter—now?</said></p>
<p><said>True, what does it matter?</said> he replied,
drawing a deep breath. <said>Still, if I thought
that you had a little love for me—if you only
liked me very much——</said></p>
<pb n="192"/>
<p><said>Don't say any more,</said> interrupted Ruth
agitatedly. <said>How can women help loving men
who are sacrificing their lives as you are all
doing? I know, every woman knows, that but
for us you would march out and cut your way
through the ring of fire. Many would fall, but
some would escape, while if you stay there is but
one doom for every one. Yes, I love you for
your bravery.</said></p>
<p>She put out her hands and clasped his frankly.</p>
<p><said>Ah, I don't mean that,</said> he cried. <said>Who
wouldn't be brave with such as you to guard?</said></p>
<p><said>Heron, we're ready. Hurry!</said> was heard
the voice of Captain Jenkins through the din.</p>
<p><said>Dear Ruth—if—I'm spared, I——</said></p>
<p>He could say no more. At that supreme
moment words, no matter how eloquent, were
meaningless. He raised her hand and pressed it
to his lips, and then something in her eyes told
him that such a cold, formal leave-taking was
childish. He threw formality to the winds, took
her in his arms and kissed her passionately. He
felt the warm pressure of her lips in return. He
released her, pale and weeping. She had intense
pity for the poor young fellow, and would have
uttered words of comfort if she could.</p>
<p><said>Take this,</said> she whispered hurriedly, dragging
a silk handkerchief from round her neck. He
seized it eagerly, his face mantling with pleasure.</p>
<p><said>God bless and save you, darling,</said> he cried.
<said>Your gift is my mascotte!</said></p>
<p>His eyes bright and jubilant he thrust the
handkerchief in his vest, and waving his cap
rushed away. Ruth, her heart panting the
<pb n="193"/>
while, watched him join the party, who by this
time were scaling the low rampart, and running
one by one to <abbr>No.</abbr> 4 barrack.</p>
<p>Throughout the mutiny, not only at Cawnpore,
but elsewhere, nothing succeeded so well as
audacity. The very daring of our men had the
effect of paralysing the sepoys, and though hardly
one of that little party of forlorn hope ought to
have reached the barrack alive or unwounded,
there was not a casualty. The gallant band of
engineers, exhausted as they were, summoned
strength to give their relievers a hearty English
cheer.</p>
<p>That day the fire of the enemy was unusually
fierce, and it was rumoured that on the morrow,
June 11, a grand attempt to storm the entrench-
ment would be made, and that the attack would
be led by Nana Sahib in person. The defenders
of <abbr>No.</abbr> 2 barrack were on the alert, but nothing
unusual happened. Just before nightfall they
saw a man cautiously lower himself over the
rampart, and dart across the intervening space.
This man was brave Captain Moore.</p>
<p><said>Boys,</said> cried Moore breathlessly, as soon as
he entered the barrack, <said>now's the time to
give the rascals a lesson. Who's game for a
dash to spike their guns? We ought to know
how to do it,</said> he added grimly, <said>for they're
our own.</said></p>
<p>The group around Moore volunteered to a man.</p>
<p><said>Sorry,</said> said he, <said>I can't have you all.
Six must remain behind to throw the scoundrels
off the scent with a hot fire.</said></p>
<p>The three engineers, greatly to their disappoint-
<pb n="193"/>
ment, and three of the relief party were selected
to stay in the little fort. Moore pointed out
that the utmost activity was needed, and the
engineers were too worn out for the demand
likely to be made on their strength.</p>
<p>When it was fully dark, Moore and his party
set out, creeping along the sandy bed of what, in
the wet season, was a water course. A couple
of big guns had that day been dragged by the
rebels from the magazine, and Moore had spotted
the place where they had been planted.</p>
<p>Like snakes the men wound their way along,
not one breathing a word though they might
have talked with perfect safety, for the inces-
sant firing would have drowned their voices.
Anxiety and strained nerves kept them silent.</p>
<p><said>Heron,</said> whispered Moore, <said>I've seen you
sprint on the running-ground. Now's your
chance to show what your best is like. We two
will do the spiking, and the others will keep off
any of the devils who may spot us.</said></p>
<p>Dick felt a sudden glow pass over him. He
could have rushed on to the work at that moment,
but Moore restrained him.</p>
<p><said>Wait till I give the word,</said> the Captain
whispered.</p>
<p>Moore issued his orders to the men who were
following, and crept on, Dick keeping close by
his side.</p>
<p><said>Halt! We're near the spot now,</said> said
Moore, under his breath.</p>
<p>The bank of the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">nullah</foreign> was very low at this
point, and Moore paused for a moment to
reconnoitre.</p>
<pb n="195"/>
<p><said>There are the guns,</said> he breathed; <said>about
a hundred yards ahead, a little to the right.
Now for it.</said></p>
<p>They climbed the bank. On reaching the top,
a couple of sepoys caught sight of them, crouch-
ing though they were, and with a yell of terror
took to their heels. They had seen Moore's face,
and maybe recognised him. Probably they
imagined he was at the head of an attacking
force, and they rushed away to give the alarm.</p>
<p><said>Quick, Heron, they mustn't reach the tents!</said>
muttered Moore from between his set teeth.</p>
<p>His revolver was in readiness, and he shot one
dead. The other, who was some distance in
advance, ran his hardest, but the champion
sprinter of Cawnpore was pursuing him. He
had scarcely covered twenty yards when Dick
cut him down. His death must have been
almost instantaneous. The next moment Dick
found Captain Moore by his side.</p>
<p><said>That was well done,</said> Dick heard Moore
whisper. <said>Better than a pistol shot. On, my
lad, before they've time to guess what we're at.</said></p>
<p>They could see the guns looming in the dark-
ness, and, running at the top of their speed, they
succeeded in spiking a couple of the largest.
They then crept back to the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">nullah</foreign>. Just as
they reached it a volley was fired close to them.
It was doubtful, however, whether those who
fired knew that the little band of Englishmen
were near. The muskets must have been fired
at random out of pure nervousness, for not one
of the party was hit.</p>

<p>The next day a grand attempt to storm the
entrenchment was made, but Nana Sahib did
not appear. The wily wretch had too much
regard for his own skin. He wanted to show
his followers that he was a man of undaunted
courage, and after announcing with much bom-
bast that he was going to lead the army to the
attack, he gave instructions to certain con-
fidential friends to announce that the Nana
might not expose his sacred head in battle, as,
in the event of his fall, the army would have
no one to look to. Thus the rascal preserved
his character for bravery, without encountering
danger.</p>
<p>When the attack was begun, the defenders
were surprised to see that their immediate assail-
ants were an undisciplined mob of Hindoos and
Mussulmans, who had been assembled in the city
to give courage and confidence to the sepoys.
The Mahomedans had been called together
under the green flag, and the day having been
decided by the priest to be a propitious one,
they marched to the sepoy camp. But as it
was found that the Mahomedans did not turn
<pb n="197"/>
up in sufficient numbers, the Hindoo flag was
hoisted, and the proclamation, while calling
upon the Hindoos to join, stated that <q>every
Hindoo who does not join the righteous cause, is
an outcast. May he eat the flesh of cows!</q>
and a good deal more to the same effect.</p>
<p>The sepoys put this motley mob in front, their
idea being to let them receive the first fire of the
English guns, and then advance to the charge
under cover of the cowering <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign>.</p>
<p>The little force inside the entrenchment was
on the alert. The batteries were under the
command of the gallant Lieutenant Ashe, Lieu-
tenant Eckford, Lieutenant Dempster, and the
intrepid Lieutenant Delafosse. Between the
batteries men were stationed, fifteen paces apart,
and sheltered by the wall. Each man had at
least three loaded muskets by his side, with
bayonets fixed, in case of assault. Some of the
trained men had as many as seven, and even
eight, muskets each.</p>
<p>Colonel Waring took his place with the rest of
the men. All difference in rank was forgotten.
The old soldier looked in at the thatched barrack
on his way to his post. Ruth ran to meet him,
and flung her arms round his neck.</p>
<p><said>Dear Colonel Waring,</said> she cried, <said>let me
go with you. It's terrible waiting here helpless,
and not knowing anything.</said></p>
<p><said>What, in heaven's name, can you do, my
dear?</said> exclaimed the Colonel blankly.</p>
<p><said>I can load muskets for you,</said> she whispered.</p>
<p>The old man did not at once reply. He
stared at the girl in amazement.</p>
<pb n="198"/>
<p><said>By God, you're right, my girl,</said> said he, at
last huskily. <said>You're a soldier's daughter,
and you'll fight and die, if need be, like a soldier.
Come!</said></p>
<p>Not another word was said. The brave Eng-
lish girl, erect and dauntless, followed the old
man to the wall, and took her place by his
side.</p>
<p><said>As soon as I have fired a musket, re-load
it.</said></p>
<p>The veteran spoke sternly, and with a soldier's
air of command. His eyes shone with a wild,
fierce light such as Ruth had never seen in them
before. She was conscious of a change even in
herself. Their old relations had changed: they
were now comrades fighting for their lives.</p>
<p>Ruth knew perfectly well how to load a musket,
and she was so expert, and the old Colonel fired
so rapidly, that in less than five minutes the
guns became too hot to hold without great pain.
Apart from the heat caused by the firing, the
sun made the barrels as though they had been
thrust in a furnace. The girl felt her hands
becoming scorched; but she bravely endured
the torture, and Waring, who was shooting as
coolly as though he were knocking over pheasants,
every bullet bringing down its man, never had to
wait for a loaded weapon.</p>
<p>It was soon seen that the rabble had no heart
for fighting. They halted at about two hundred
yards from the entrenchment wall, and no
efforts of the sepoys behind could induce them
to advance a single inch farther. The fire of the
defenders was wildly returned, but only with
<pb n="199"/>
muskets. The spiking of the guns the previous
night rendered the guns unusable.</p>
<p>Suddenly a terrific roar of cannon was heard
from Ashe's battery. The grape-shot tore its
way through the crowd, dealing death and
destruction. Shrieks of terror rent the air,
and the next moment the whole host turned
tail, and took to their heels in every direction.</p>
<p><said>Done 'em, by God,</said> muttered the Colonel,
smiling grimly. <said>The rascals won't forget
this lesson. If we only had a few shells!</said></p>
<p>The old officer was right. By some terrible
omission no shells had been stored. The result
was that the sepoy force were able gradually
to advance their batteries day by day nearer the
entrenchment. But for this, the gallant little
garrison might have held out.</p>
<p>Colonel Waring ceased to fire. It was but
wasting ammunition. Besides, a score or so of
the men stationed in the outside barracks had
rushed out in pursuit. They were cutting and
slashing till their arms ached, and friends and
foes were mixed. The Colonel turned to where
he had left Ruth. She had disappeared, and he
looked across to the thatched barrack, expecting
to see her under the verandah. But he was
mistaken. Then he heard the next man, sta-
tioned fifteen paces from him, give a shout,
and saw him leap over the wall.</p>
<p>Waring looked across the parapet, and to his
amazement beheld Ruth stooping over a native
who was lying on the ground. A wounded
sepoy a few yards off, with a fiendish look on his
face, was in the act of levelling his musket at her,
<pb n="200"/>
when the man who had leaped the wall foiled his
intention with a vigorous bayonet thrust. The
girl was quite unconscious of her peril.</p>
<p><said>A narrow escape for you, miss!</said> growled
Private Lyons, of the 32nd, the man who had
run to her rescue. <said>You ought never to have
come outside.</said></p>
<p>They were joined by Colonel Waring, who, to
his amazement, saw that Ruth was binding up
the arm of the native.</p>
<p><said>My dear child,</said> he cried half angrily.
<said>What have we to do with wounded Hindoos?
Haven't we enough wounded of our own?</said></p>
<p><said>Don't you see who it is?</said> cried Ruth.
<said>Don't you know Frank Hale?</said></p>
<p><said>What!</said> ejaculated the Colonel.</p>
<p><said>It's all right, Colonel Waring,</said> said the
wounded young man, in a faint voice, and in
unmistakable English accents. <said>I never thought
to reach her alive.</said></p>
<p>Frank Hale was the son of one of the principal
merchants of Cawnpore. Many of the residents
had not had time to get to the entrenchment
when the Mutiny broke out, and sad indeed was
their fate. Hale disguised himself as a native,
and remained in hiding until the rabble were
assembled to march upon the entrenchment.
He then joined the crowd, hoping to find his way
to his countrymen, running a fearful risk, not
so much from the sepoys as from the bullets
of the besieged. He had escaped both only at
the last moment to have his arm gashed by the
tulwar of a native who had recognised him.
It was then that Hale had through an opening
<pb n="201"/>
in the wall, made by a round shot the day
before, caught sight of Ruth, and shouted her
name and his own. She heard him and crept
out through the aperture.</p>
<p>The lad, he was scarcely more, was frightfully
emaciated, and the loss of blood weakened him
so much he fainted. He was carried into the
thatched barrack; but there was no room for
him in the apartment which had been converted
into a hospital. It could not be said he had
gained much by escaping into the entrenchment.</p>
<p>A gleam of hope crept into the hearts of the
poor women at the news of the defeat of their
assailants; but it soon faded. The handful
of brave fellows who had ventured in pursuit
had to return almost immediately, an over-
whelming force of the enemy having assembled.
The defeat could only be regarded as a tem-
porary check; the next day the attack would
most likely be renewed.</p>
<p>Frank Hale described the state of the city
at the time of the outbreak as most appalling.
It was, he said, as if the day of judgment had
come. The European quarter was surrounded
by fire. Swarms of dusky natives, the labouring
classes, the scum of the city, crowded in on all
sides, plundering the houses, and getting drunk
on the wines and spirits they found there.</p>
<p>On the following day, when the mutineers
commenced the attack on the entrenchment,
the state of things was worse. The 2nd Cavalry-
men, in an excited state of bravado, galloped to
and from the magazine at a tremendous rate,
their swords jingling in their scabbards, their
<pb n="202"/>
horses' feet resounding on all sides, and throwing
up clouds of dust. The soldiers seemed frenzied.
Then guns of various sizes and ammunition
wagons, drawn by Government bullocks, were
taken from the magazine, to be used against the
Englishmen who had once owned them.</p>
<p>Hale said that when the batteries opened fire
it seemed as if the earth was turning upside
down. Fear and trembling were on all sides,
except among the mutinous troops, and the
plunderers, who went about committing all
kinds of atrocities. Meanwhile the work of cold-
blooded murder of the Europeans who had not
gone into the entrenchment, but hid themselves
in places where they thought they would be safe,
was carried on with unremitting ferocity.
Natives, in many instances their own servants,
betrayed them to the murderers. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mackin-
tosh, a well-known resident of Cawnpore, and
one of his sons dressed themselves like <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">chowka-
dars</foreign>, and remained amongst their servants for
a day or two, but were soon recognised. Then
they put on the dress of Brahmins and ran
away, but on the road, being alarmed, got under
a bridge, where some boys pointed them out to
the sepoys, who dragged them from their hiding-
place, and hacked them to pieces. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mackin-
tosh, a lady of seventy, was hiding in her washer-
woman's house, but was discovered and taken
before the Nana. Even so old and so helpless
a woman was shown no mercy. She was be-
headed. Not one of those who remained out
of the entrenchment but was traced out and
butchered.</p>
<pb n="203"/>
<p>There was no resistance, save in the case of
a discharged drummer of the 2nd Infantry, who,
with a few native Christians, took shelter in a
small but strongly built flat-roofed house, the
doors of which they barricaded with bricks and
stones. Here they repelled during the whole of
one day the attacks made upon them. But at
night the wretches set fire to the thatched
verandah at the sides of the house, and the
gallant little band of heroes were burnt to death.</p>
<p>There was not a house in Cawnpore but
what was searched. The murderers even went
into the villages in the outlying districts, and
hunted for Europeans. At Nujjubgurh, about
sixteen miles to the east of Cawnpore, occurred
one of those heroic episodes with which the
Mutiny abounds, and which cannot be read
without a thrill of admiration. Here <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Edward
Greenway, with his aged mother, his wife and
children, together with a friend, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hollings,
sought refuge, thinking the rebels would not
proceed so far away to molest them. <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Hollings was a capital shot, and determined, if
attacked, to fight to the last.</p>
<p>On the approach of the murderous rabble,
all the inmates of the house ascended to the
upper part, where, from a terrace which ran
round the building, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hollings opened fire.
So good was his aim, that he killed and wounded
some sixteen of the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign>. The news of his
gallant resistance reached the Nana, and a detach-
ment of troops was dispatched from Cawnpore
to take the household prisoners.</p>
<p>By the time the sepoys arrived, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hollings
<pb n="204"/>
had exhausted all his ammunition, and when
he found he could fight no more, he sat down
on one of the balustrades, fully exposed to view,
and called out to the troops to shoot him.
Several shots were fired, and at last one struck
him in the chest, and brought the brave fellow,
head foremost, to the ground, and the fall com-
pleted his death. After this, the others gave
themselves up, and would have been killed
there and then, but a promise of high ransom
by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenway saved their lives.</p>
<p>A Portuguese merchant named De Gama,
who did not think General Wheeler's entrench-
ment strong enough, hid in a house, where he was
discovered, and taken before the Nana, with
whom he used to have extensive dealings. As
he knew the Nana so well, he thought his life
would be spared. Vain hope! The wretch
turned his face away in anger, and one of his
followers interpreting his expression immedi-
ately drew his sword, and struck De Gama three
or four times with it. The poor fellow fell bleed-
ing to the ground, and a few more strokes
finished him.</p>
<p>A family named Jacobie contrived to cross
the river at night, and remained under cover
of long grass on the banks. They were dis-
covered and sent to the Nana, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jacobie dying
of sunstroke on the way. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Jacobie was a
woman of high courage, and defied the Nana to
his face, reproaching him for the cold-blooded
murders he had committed. She told him it
was an act of cowardice to kill helpless women
and children, and that she and her children had
<pb n="205"/>
done nothing to offend him in any way, and if
he thought that by killing her and others
England would become empty, he was greatly
mistaken. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Jacobie's bold speech had the
effect of shaming the Nana and all present, and
she was ordered to be sent to the Sowada Kothi
with her children, there to be kept prisoners
along with old <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenway.</p>
<p>Besides the slaughter of Europeans and
Eurasians, many Hindoos and Mahomedans,
suspected of aiding or serving the British force,
were put to death. A list was made of all the
bankers, who were shorn of their wealth, and
property of every description was plundered or
wantonly destroyed. Any attempt to carry
intelligence or supplies to the besieged was
punished with death or mutilation of the hand
or nose, by the order of the Nana or his diabolical
lieutenant, Azimoolah Khan.</p>
<p>Everything which poor Frank Hale had to
tell was listened to with feelings of horror,
heightened by the thought that the fate of these
victims might be theirs also. Despair had
begun to spread through the entrenchment,
and it needed all General Wheeler's persuasion
and calmness to prevent the women giving way
to frenzied lamentations.</p>
<p><said>Help must reach us before the 14th,</said> said
stout Sir Hugh. <said>The messages I received
on the eve of the outbreak told me that Neill
was on his way with the Madras Fusiliers.
Two hundred—nay, one hundred—of Neill's
<soCalled>Lambs</soCalled> would suffice.</said></p>
<p>And the drooping spirits of the poor creatures
<pb n="206"/>
revived at the thought that on the 14th an end
would come to their miseries. Nothing but
this hope buoyed them up.</p>
<p>The day after the failure of the rebel assault
the fight was renewed. The sepoys could be
seen bringing more guns, and an incessant
musketry fire was poured into the entrenchment
from the nearest corner, while the guns sent
their shot without intermission against the brick
walls of the buildings. It was marvellous, indeed,
that they held together.</p>
<p>This was June 11, and on that day the torture
was increased by a fresh horror. Those in the
thatched roof barrack were suddenly startled
by hearing shrieks proceeding from the other
buildings. The next minute terrified women
and children were seen crowding out of the
door, and running across the open space to the
thatched barrack. The fear of the shots, which,
as usual, were flying all round, was for the
moment overcome by a new alarm.</p>
<p><said>The barracks are on fire!</said> was the agonised
reply to the frenzied questioners.</p>
<p>It was quite true, but the disaster was not so
great as was imagined. A quantity of clothes
in one of the rooms had indeed become alight,
but the fire was soon extinguished, not, however,
before a panic had arisen. Unfortunately, the
result of this stampede was that the thatched
barrack, already crowded to excess, was filled to
suffocation, for the timid women refused to go
back.</p>
<p>Up to this time some slight shelter from the
missiles had been obtained by standing at the
<pb n="207"/>
angles of the walls, and in the archways of the
doors; but now, with fresh numbers crowding
in, some were forced into the centre of the
apartment, where already was a great gash in
the roof.</p>
<p>Among those who were thus compelled to
change their position was a lady who held the
hand of her little son, a handsome boy of five,
tightly in her own. Scarcely had they gone a
couple of yards towards the middle of the room,
than something struck the roof with a deafening
crash, and an 18-pounder fell, killing the boy
instantly. The wail of grief which burst from
the lips of the agonised mother went to the
hearts of all, oppressed as they were already
with the intensity of unspeakable misery.</p>
<p>This was only one of the dramatic bereave-
ments which happened during this awful time.
It was immediately after the death of the poor
little chap that Captain Seppings, the officiating
deputy-paymaster, wrote a melancholy record,
which was afterwards found on the wall. He
was standing under one of the door arches, with
wife and children, quite calm and collected, and
endeavouring to encourage the ladies with him.
After kneeling down and praying, he took out
a pencil and wrote on the wall:</p>
<p><q>The following were in this barrack on June 11,
1857: Captain Seppings, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> ditto, three
children, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Wainwright, ditto infant, <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Cripps, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Halliday.</q></p>
<p>This 11th of June seemed fated to produce sur-
prises. Captain Seppings had just replaced the
pencil in his pocket, when another piercing
<pb n="208"/>
shriek of a female was heard. Two soldiers'
wives were seen hastily moving to a corner in
a side room where there was a cot, and pointing
to it. Quick as lightning, Sergeant Loveland
rushed forward, and dragged out a most hide-
ously loathsome figure of a native, blackened
and scorched all over, as if burnt with fire.</p>
<p><said>You demon!</said> hissed the sergeant between
his teeth, as he dragged the wretch across the
floor to the verandah.</p>
<p>Every one shuddered. They knew the lot in
store for this incendiary. The sound of a pistol
fired on the verandah told that justice had been
short and sharp. No one could tell how the
fellow came to be in the barrack. It was, how-
ever, settled that he had something to do with
the fire in the flat-roof barrack, for a box of
matches was found on the body, and doubtless
he intended to set fire to the other barrack also.</p>
<p>When the alarm had subsided, some of the
women were persuaded to return to the shelter
from which the fire had driven them. The
journey back through a hailstorm of bullets had
to be made. It was done; but such were the
nervousness and excitement, many forgot their
apartments, and took up fresh quarters. Chil-
dren were separated from their parents, wives
from husbands, and the wretchedness and
anguish of mind, if such a thing were possible,
were increased.</p>
<p>As the afternoon of the 11th wore on, the
battle waxed very hot, and at about five o'clock
several desperate attacks were made by the
mutineers. Thousands of armed men were
<pb n="209"/>
spread about under every corner available, their
muskets and bayonets only perceptible, and firing
as fast as they could load. Their batteries threw
in hot shell, and grape, tearing and crashing.
The walls, the supporting timbers, the roofs, the
verandahs were rapidly becoming tottering ruins.
The din of this fearful cannonading and musketry
was so incessant, lasting nearly a couple of hours,
that it resembled continuous claps of thunder in
a tremendous storm.</p>
<p>But throughout all this the sepoys dared not
show themselves. When the line of the un-
finished barracks outside the entrenchment be-
came filled with the mutineers, creeping up one
by one, a gallant band, under Captain Jenkins,
or the intrepid Moore, or Mowbray Thompson,
would sally out from barracks <abbr>Nos.</abbr> 2 and 4, and
with musket and sword clear these shelters of
the foe. Scores of the enemy were cut down, for
they never stopped to fight—they were in too
great a funk. When they were driven out into
the open the men behind the entrenchment wall
marked them, and very few escaped with their
lives.</p>
<p>At last the end of the terrible day came, and
many were the fervent prayers offered up for
the speedy coming of Neill. Only three days
more, the poor women tried to comfort them-
selves with saying, and he would be in sight with
his <soCalled>Lambs.</soCalled></p>
<p>But the 14th came, and no Neill appeared.
Then, indeed, despair was close at hand.</p>

<head type="main">Why Help did not come to Cawnpore</head>

<p>Meanwhile Colonel Hamilton with his small
army of relief, and with Philip Heron attached
to his staff, was pushing his way to Benares, the
Holy City of the Brahmins, with as much speed
as the innumerable obstacles would permit.</p>
<p>The troops travelled along the Grand Trunk
Road, which, nine hundred miles in length, runs
from Calcutta to Delhi. It is one of the few
noteworthy results of the East India Company's
rule, and in parts is a very fine piece of engineer-
ing work. The difficulty was the deficiency of
traction power. The supply of horses broke
down three days after leaving Raneegunge;
bullocks were not to be thought of, and it was
only by a mixture of persuasion and threats that
natives were induced to drag the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dâk</foreign> carriages.</p>
<p>They reached the river Soane, about a hundred
miles from Benares, to find that the river was
nearly dry, and that to ferry across was im-
possible. The coolies refused to go any farther,
and bullocks had to be hired. Seven mortal
hours were spent in crossing the river-bed, the
animals occasionally sinking above their knees
in the wet sand, and refusing to move.</p>
<p>The native drivers plied the whip remorse-
<pb n="211"/>
lessly; they poured out benediction and male-
diction with equal volubility. The animals were
their children, their sons, their brothers, their
good uncles, their esteemed brothers-in-law.
They were gentlemen; they were pigs; they were
princes; they were dogs, and so were their
ancestors for several thousands of years. Mac-
intyre cursed them in Gaelic, Major Tim Cassidy
addressed them in the vernacular of the Dublin
slums. Heron tried the effect of a little of the
Turkish slang he had heard used in the Crimea.
The bullocks were impervious to all.</p>
<p><said>Begorrah, if we only had a Welshman among
us now,</said> exclaimed Cassidy. <said>I'm tould that
there's no animal breathing can stand being
sworn at in Welsh.</said></p>
<p>The officers had plenty of time during that
intermediate passage of the river to sketch the
romantic fortress of Rhotasghur, which, with a
grim picturesqueness of its own, stands out a
notable landmark on the river-bank; but not
one was in the mood for sketching. Vague
rumours had reached them from Benares. Neill,
it was asserted, had been compelled to stay there
instead of pushing on to Cawnpore. The news
came from a Company's agent at one of the
refreshment bungalows—a solitary instance of a
man who had not deserted his post.</p>
<p>These refreshment bungalows had been built
by the Indian Government for the accommoda-
tion, at fixed rates, of the higher grades of
travellers. A bungalow of this kind generally
contained two separate suites of apartments—a
dining, sitting, and bedroom, a dressing- and a
<pb n="212"/>
bath-room—the last not being the least valued
by the dusty traveller. The furniture was not
more than a bed, a table, two or three chairs,
and the bathing-room apparatus. The estab-
lishment of servants consisted of a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khansuman</foreign>,
or steward, a bearer, a cook, and a sweeper.</p>
<p>But with the exception of the one mentioned,
all the refreshment bungalows were desolate.
The soldiers ransacked one or two in the hopes of
finding something in the larders, but they were
literally empty. Not even a chicken, the in-
variable adjunct of these bungalows in peaceful
times, was to be found. The custodians, panic-
stricken, had fled. There were other ominous
signs of revolt. Bad news must have come from
Benares, for the villages along the line of route
were peopleless. Tired of the snail-like progress
of the bullocks, Colonel Hamilton sent out a
foraging party in search of natives to draw the
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dâk</foreign> carriages, and, thanks to the high pay
offered, this effort was successful.</p>
<p>Philip Heron saw by the appearance of the
men that he was really in the North-West
Provinces. The natives of the Doab were fine,
stalwart fellows—very different from the slim
and undersized Bengalis. Their clothes, too, were
better. In place of the dirty whity-brown rags
of the Lower Provinces, they wore coloured
garments gracefully adjusted.</p>
<p>The nearer the party got to Benares the more
confirmatory was the evidence that the mutiny
must have broken out there. Still they could
get no definite news. It was not until they saw
in the pale light of the dawn the temples and
<pb n="213"/>
cupolas of the famous Brahminical city that they
learnt what had happened.</p>
<p>During the heat of the day the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dâk</foreign> carriages
were used. In the early morning and in the
evening, until far into the night, the men
walked, and so lightened the labour and hastened
the progress. Travelling by <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dâk</foreign> is a process of
locomotion only now to be seen in remote parts
of India. A <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dâk</foreign> may be described roughly as a
large palanquin running on four big wheels.
Round the roof is a railing for the more secure
accommodation of such luggage as cannot be
packed outside. The interior is lined with strong
woollen stuff; the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dâk</foreign> carriage is of consider-
able length, and there is space in it for a great
many odds and ends.</p>
<p>Some ten miles from Benares, Heron, with
Cassidy and Macintyre, were tramping ahead of
the main body, when they saw a horseman
cantering along the dusty road, followed by a
dozen or so mounted men. The leader shouted,
waved his hand, and put his horse to a gallop.</p>
<p><said>Hurrah!</said> he called out heartily, when he
was near enough. <said>Welcome, Ross-shire Buffs!
I'm Jim Ellicott, of the <soCalled>Lambs.</soCalled></said></p>
<p><said>Bedad! more tiger than lamb, I'll go bail,</said>
said Tim. <said>You may as well know us by name.
Here's Donald Macintyre, the best fellow that
ever breathed—ye'd say so, too, if you saw
Donald with a dhrop of whisky inside of him—
t'other is Phil Heron, a Balaclava boy; and I'm
meself—that is, I'm Tim Cassidy, of the 64th.
What's up at Benares?</said></p>
<p><said>Nothing just now but hanging niggers and
<pb n="214"/>
burning villages,</said> rejoined Ellicott, with a grim
smile. <said>We've had a sharp time of it; but Neill
hasn't got a tender hand, and the pandies are
finding it out.</said></p>
<p><said>And where's the Colonel?</said> asked Macin-
tyre.</p>
<p><said>Gone to Allahabad. Started over a fort-
night ago with forty-three of the Fusiliers.</said></p>
<p><said>And has he reached there safely?</said></p>
<p><said>You bet,</said> answered Ellicott—better known
as <soCalled>big Jim Ellicott</soCalled>—in a confident tone.
<said>If there's a way to do a thing, John Neill's the
man to find out that way. Mind you, we've
heard no news of him since he started; but he's
all right, I'll swear.</said></p>
<p><said>Eh, man, but is all quiet at Allahabad?</said>
asked Macintyre. <said>It's the most important
military station on the Ganges, ye see, and the
wurrst protected.</said></p>
<p><said>That's so,</said> said Ellicott. <said>Anyhow, we'd
heard that nothing was very wrong when Neill
set out; but, to tell you the truth, the sepoys
have done their work of interrupting the com-
munications better than usual.</said></p>
<p>This was quite true, as Heron afterwards dis-
covered. The telegraph wire between Allahabad
and Benares had been cut, and the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dâk</foreign> carriages
smashed into fragments by the mutineers.
Later on the <soCalled>lightning <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dâk</foreign>,</soCalled> as the natives
called the telegraph, was made use of in a
fashion never dreamt of by its original con-
structors. Some of the more ingenious of the
sepoys discovered that the hollow iron posts
which supported the wires would make a good
<pb n="215"/>
substitute for guns, and that the wire cut up in
pieces could be fired instead of lead.</p>
<p><said>Do you think Neill is making his way to
Cawnpore?</said> said Heron.</p>
<p>Big Jim shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p><said>I should think not. He's left more than
half his force at Benares. What can he do with
forty-three men? They can't spare a man at
Allahabad. No; he won't move a step till we
push up from Benares. It's a good thing you
fellows have come; it'll relieve the work a bit.</said></p>
<p><said>Have you heard from Cawnpore?</said> went
on Heron anxiously.</p>
<p><said>Not a word. How could we? Haven't
I told you that <choice><corr>communications</corr><orig>communiations</orig></choice> have been cut off
for nearly three weeks?</said></p>
<p>Three weeks! What might not happen in
three weeks? The reports already received
showed that wherever the rebellion broke out
it spread with lightning-like rapidity. It was
not a question of days, but of hours. It seemed
to Heron of far more importance to push on to
Cawnpore than to linger at Benares, where
Neill's stern reprisals had already had their effect.</p>
<p><said>Yes, I know,</said> exclaimed Ellicott impatiently,
when Heron pointed this out. <said>But I can only
obey orders. The Colonel's made me hangman
in ordinary, and, by Heaven, I'm doing my duty.
What do you think of a row of three gibbets
with three ropes to each? Wholesale, isn't it?</said>
And stern Jim Ellicott rode away to meet
Colonel Hamilton and Major Stirling, and left
the others to go on towards Benares.</p>
<p>Just as the party had come in view of the
<pb n="216"/>
famous <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">ghauts</foreign>, which, the river being low,
seemed of a towering height, another officer
from Benares, Captain Jervis, met them, and
told what had happened during the past fortnight.
It seemed that when Neill arrived at Benares,
he intended starting with a detachment for
Cawnpore on the following afternoon; but shortly
before the appointed time, intelligence was
received from Lieutenant Palliser (who had
been sent to Azimgurrh, fifty-six miles east of
Benares, to bring away the treasure there) of
an outbreak in this place.</p>
<p>The story was exaggerated, but it had the
effect of causing much uneasiness at Benares.
Brigadier Ponsonby consulted with Neill, and,
doubts being entertained by the brigadier as to
the loyalty of the 37th Native Infantry, he
proposed that their muskets should be taken
from them, leaving them, however, their side-
arms. The Sikhs and the 13th Native Infantry,
also stationed at Benares, were believed to be
staunch. Neill was not in favour of this half-
and-half course. He urged immediate and com-
plete disarmament, and eventually the brigadier
gave way.</p>
<p>At 5 <abbr>p.m.</abbr> Neill was on the ground with 150
of Her Majesty's 10th, sixty Madras Fusiliers,
three guns, and thirty men. At this time no
intimation had been received by any officer that
the corps was disposed to mutiny. On the con-
trary, Colonel Spottiswoode, the commanding
officer of the 13th, declared that his European
non-commissioned staff <q>observed nothing
doubtful in the conduct of the men, but that up
<pb n="217"/>
to the last moment every man was most obedient
and civil to all authorities.</q></p>
<p><said>What happened exactly,</said> said Jervis, <said>I
don't quite know, and I don't believe anybody
else does. It was an awful muddle, that's all I
can tell. Brigadier Ponsonby was attacked
with sunstroke, and Colonel Spottiswoode and
Colonel Neill did not seem of the same mind;
so what with one and what with the other, the
sepoys were driven wild with panic. I hope I
may never see such a sight again. And the worst
of it is, I don't believe the beggars intended to
mutiny. The fact was, we made too much fuss
about the disarmament, and they thought we
were all in a funk, and intended to shoot the lot.</said></p>
<p><said>But ye haven't told us yet what they did,
man?</said> said Macintyre, with the quiet per-
sistency of the Scotchman.</p>
<p><said>It was this way. The 37th were drawn
up in front of their lines, with the cannon pointed
at them. Our fellows were posted within musket
range, and the Sikhs and 13th Cavalry within sight.
You see, the 37th, finding themselves hemmed in
with musketry and artillery, of course thought
they were going to be blown to pieces, and all that
the officers could do didn't remove the impression.
That was the beginning of the business.</said></p>
<p><said>And then?</said> said Heron.</p>
<p><said>Well, the men were ordered to put their
arms into the little stone buildings which we
call kotes, and they obeyed. It was all right
up to that time; but when they saw the 10th
marching to the kotes to secure the muskets,
they went into a sort of frenzy, and made a rush
<pb n="218"/>
for the kotes. Our fellows ran, too, and it was
neck and neck for a time; but somehow the
pandies got there first, and then it was like
putting a match to a magazine. They opened
fire upon their own officers, kneeling and taking
deliberate aim. Just think of it! Yet, upon my
soul, I believe ten minutes before they hadn't the
slightest intention of doing anything of the kind.</said></p>
<p><said>They just ran amuck, ye mean?</said> said
Macintyre.</p>
<p><said>That's it. Major Barrett, who thought
they had been unfairly treated, shouted that he
would remain with them, and share their fate.
It made no difference. Their blood was up, and
while some fired upon Barrett, others attacked
him with their bayonets. The same with the
sergeant-major. They were only saved by a
guard of faithful sepoys, who got them away.
While this was being done, poor Captain Guise,
of the 13th Cavalry, was riding across the parade-
ground, and fell riddled with bullets.</said></p>
<p><said>The scoundrelly blaiguards!</said> cried Tim
Cassidy, his moustache bristling. <said>I knew poor
Guise, and, by Heaven, I'll avenge his death!</said></p>
<p><said>You needn't trouble, major,</said> said Jervis
quietly, <said>his loss has long since been requited
in Hindoo blood. Dodgson, who was appointed
in Guise's place, very nearly met the same fate.
When he told the troopers he'd been sent to
command them, they broke into a low murmur
and flashed their swords. <said>God!</said> I exclaimed
to Ellicott, <said>the cavalry are turning traitors!</said>
The words were scarcely out of my mouth,
when one of the fellows raised a pistol and fired
<pb n="219"/>
at Dodgson. The bullet grazed the funny-bone
of his sword-arm, and his hand dropped as if
it were paralysed. Then the rascal who fired
the pistol rushed to cut him down; but another
man got in the villain's way, and Dodgson just
escaped by the skin of his teeth.</said></p>
<p><said>But what in the name of Heaven were our
men doing all this time?</said> exclaimed Heron.</p>
<p><said>Why, returning the fire of the mutineers.
It was a confoundedly unfair fight, for our men
were in the open, while the rebels were skulking
behind the kotes, and firing from these shelters.
But our turn was to come. When the cavalry
broke loose, the Sikhs were seized with the
contagion, and rushed madly on the guns.
Captain Olpherts was ready. He wheeled round
his guns splendidly, and poured a shower of grape
into the beggars. This staggered 'em a bit, but
they came on again with fiendish yells, and this
time they were joined by the cavalry and the
37th. R-r-r-rh! went Olpherts' guns a second
time, and this was enough. The sum total was
that the 37th were utterly smashed, and the
cavalry and the Sikhs frightened out of their
wits. The whole lot turned tail and went off.</said></p>
<p><said>Where to?</said> said Heron.</p>
<p><said>Ah, there's the worst of it! I'm afraid
they've gone to Allahabad to spread the rebellion,
and from Allahabad they may make a dash for
Cawnpore and Lucknow. I call this Benares
business most unfortunate. I'm sure it might
have been avoided.</said></p>
<p>This was indeed disquieting. It was no satis-
faction to any one to know that Neill had been
<pb n="220"/>
flogging and hanging without stint at Benares.
If Jervis was right in his opinion that the sepoys
at Benares had been forced by misapprehension
into mutiny, what a responsibility might rest
upon those who had blundered! Yet who could
have foretold the appalling consequences of that
fatal delay at Benares? The fierce outbreak at
Allahabad—an outbreak marked by one of the
most cold-blooded acts of atrocity that that
terrible time could show—was perhaps a natural
sequel; but no one could conceive the horror
of Cawnpore, the dastardly treachery of the
Nana, and his still more treacherous lieutenant,
Azimoolah Khan.</p>
<p>The little body of troops entered Benares in
something like a procession. The European resi-
dents turned out to meet them. The natives,
who swarmed in the narrow streets, looked
sullenly upon the men of the 64th, and wonder-
ingly at the Highlanders. The dress of the latter
puzzled them not a little.</p>
<p>In spite of the anxious thoughts which were
ever present in his mind, Philip Heron could not
help being impressed by the picturesqueness,
the wealth of glowing colour, the teeming life
of Benares. It was still the early morning
when the party reached the interior, yet the city
was all astir. They threaded lanes and alleys
so narrow that they could hardly force their
way through the crowd; high buildings lined
these lanes on each side, and, judging from the
squalor and filth of the thoroughfares, no one
would imagine that these high buildings con-
cealed stately gardens and spacious quadrangles.</p>
<pb n="221"/>
<p>Looking from the tall, slender minarets of
Aurungzebe's mosque, the city is seen to spread
itself out like a map, divided into sections by
thin, tortuous lines. In the broad spaces be-
tween the lines are the secluded retreats, hidden
by the high buildings and walls bordering the
narrow streets. Some of these retreats are re-
markably beautiful, surrounded by stone cloisters
decorated with a profusion of ornament and
flanked by high towers. The smaller ones are
laid out in parterres of flowers, with fountains
in the centre, and all are tenanted by numerous
birds of the brightest plumage.</p>
<p>When passing through the gate leading into
the city they heard a sound strange to English
ears—the voice of a priest calling the muezzin.
To Benares, the <soCalled>Holy City,</soCalled> come shoals of
pilgrims, and crowds of beggars of every de-
scription blocked up the entrances to the various
sacred buildings. Many of these mendicants were
most hideous and repulsive. Maimed and dis-
torted figures, their injuries mostly sell-inflicted,
jostled against the visitors, begging for alms.
Numbers of these miserable wretches had no
covering whatever, except a coating of mud and
chalk; while their long, untrimmed beards and
hair were matted with filth.</p>
<p><said>Begorrah!</said> exclaimed Cassidy, with a
shudder of disgust, <said>let's get out of this. Ugh,
you beast. Hang me it you're not too disgusting
for even the point of my toe to touch you, or I'd
kick you out of the way!</said> This was to a
particularly objectionable fakir, who suddenly
protruded an indescribably horrible hand, the
<pb n="222"/>
nails of which extended inches beyond the
finger-tips.</p>
<p>Quarters were assigned to the new-comers, and
they were not sorry to sit down in a roomy
bungalow to breakfast—the first good meal they
had had since they had left Calcutta. Of course,
they soon fraternised with the officers of Her
Majesty's 10th, and naturally the talk was of
nothing but what had happened in the city.
Then the all-important question came. Were
they to push on to Allahabad, or should they be
ordered to remain at Benares? To Heron the
decision was of vital moment, and he impa-
tiently awaited the return of Macintyre, who
was attending upon Colonel Hamilton. Old
<soCalled>Wattie</soCalled> and Major Stirling were in conference
with Colonel Spottiswoode. Macintyre joined
his comrades in the afternoon, and was imme-
diately surrounded. His resolute face was de-
cidedly gloomy.</p>
<p><said>We've got to stay here, laddies, among the
filthy pilgrims. The Fusiliers are moving as
rapidly as they can up to Allahabad. We're to
follow them, but not until Havelock arrives.</said></p>
<p><said>And when will that be?</said> Heron asked.</p>
<p>No one could say. It was indeed useless at
the moment to hazard an opinion upon anything
dependent upon time. Fate, with persistent
malignancy, seemed to be pursuing the military
and civilians shut up in Cawnpore, and every-
thing went wrong.</p>
<p>Thus Colonel Neill with a good portion of his
men arrived at Benares on June 3, the day before
the Cawnpore sepoys broke out into open mutiny.
<pb n="223"/>
Neill had intended starting for Cawnpore the
afternoon of the day after reaching Benares.
Had he done so the horrors of the Cawnpore
tragedy would never have occurred.</p>
<p>But for this delay Neill was not in the least to
blame. According to the latest news from the
doomed city, there did not appear to be any
immediate danger. True, on May 27 General
Wheeler wrote: <q>All quiet; but I feel by no
means confident it will continue so</q>; but this
was no more than might be expected, and it did
not appear to warrant any urgent necessity for
pushing on to Cawnpore in view of the unrest at
Benares itself, where, as already related, Neill
within two days after his arrival had his hands
full.</p>
<p>It was strange, in spite of over a century of
British rule in India, that we knew so little of
the inner workings and life of the native, whether
Hindoo or Mahomedan. The rapid transmis-
sion of news from village to village, from city to
city, was one of the mysteries never solved.
There seemed to be a secret mail, but of its
mechanism Europeans knew nothing. It is in-
disputable that outbreaks occurred within a few
hours in places many miles distant from each
other. One outburst seemed to precipitate a
second and a third, yet the intervals of time
were so brief as to preclude the possibility of
news being conveyed by ordinary means.</p>
<p>The closeness of the dates of the various re-
volts would indicate something more than a mere
coincidence. On May 30 the troops at Lucknow
and Bareilly mutinied; on the 31st they broke
<pb n="224"/>
out at Budaon, and Shahjehanpore. On the
3rd occurred the butchery of the officers and
residents at Seetapore; on the 4th the outbreaks
at Cawnpore and Benares. On the very day
when the <soCalled>loyal</soCalled> 6th were murdering their
officers at Allahabad the sepoys at Jhansi were
revelling in massacre. On that day also Nana
Sahib, with a politeness truly fiendish in its
irony, intimated by letter to Sir Hugh Wheeler
his intention of opening fire upon the entrench-
ments!</p>
<p>This coincidence of attack argues in favour of
a well-thought-out and carefully arranged
scheme of rebellion, but of such a scheme there
is very little direct evidence. Even allowing there
must have been a plan, the details must have
been upset by the premature outbreak at Meerut.
But excepting at Cawnpore, where the Mahara-
jah had a definite grievance, and had for years
been whetting his appetite for vengeance, it is
difficult to find a well-founded case of a definite
policy on the part of the mutineers. However
this may be, it is certain that the rebels when
defeated at one place knew well enough where
to hasten to assist other revolting centres.</p>
<p>After Neill had done his best to quell disorder
at Benares, he had the rising at Allahabad to
cope with, and here his difficulties were tre-
mendous. He found that the authorities had
done nothing. They had laid in no supplies;
they had made no preparation for the transport
of troops to Cawnpore and Lucknow, where help
was so sorely needed. They had not even at-
tempted to open communication with Cawnpore,
<pb n="225"/>
and knew nothing of the terrible straits to which
the devoted garrison was reduced. Yet Cawn-
pore was but 120 miles distant, and this fact
makes it more poignant to think of the heroism
of the men, and the patience and endurance of
the women during that ghastly three weeks of
bloodshed and terror from the 6th to the 27th,
and of that dark and unspeakable tragedy of
July 16.</p>
<p>Again we say no fault can be laid at the door
of Neill. He worked like a Trojan; and had he
known of the state of affairs at Cawnpore, he
would have made a dash for the beleaguered
garrison, small and inadequate as his force was.
When tidings at last reached him he vigorously
engaged in preparations for sending a relief force,
and he wrote to Sir Henry Lawrence on the
18th, and also on the 23rd, telling him he was
about to dispatch immediately 400 Europeans
and 300 Sikhs to the assistance of Cawnpore.</p>
<p>Once more the Fates intervened. Cholera
broke out in Allahabad. The supply of medicine
and medical appliances was, like everything else
in the city, very deficient; and when Neill was
in a position to make a definite move it was
discovered that there were but sixteen <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dhoolies</foreign>
or litters available, although a considerable
number of these was a primary essential for the
projected expedition, and that all materials for
making others were wanting, as well as workmen.
Neill had to telegraph to head-quarters for a
supply, and, cruel irony of Fate, the order was
given at Calcutta on the very day of the capitu-
lation of Cawnpore!</p>

<head type="main">No Surrender!</head>

<p>June 14 came and went, and the poor, half-
starved, wounded, rapidly diminishing garrison
knew nothing of Neill's movements, nor the
cause of his delay.</p>
<p>On the evening of that day General Wheeler
wrote to Sir Henry Lawrence at Lucknow
describing his position. He said: <q>The whole
Christian population is with us in a temporary
entrenchment, and our defence has been noble
and wonderful, our loss heavy and cruel. We
want aid—aid! If we had 200 men we could
punish the scoundrels and aid you.</q></p>
<p>Pathetic and simple words, but the hope they
expressed was vain. Sir Henry Lawrence was
himself at that moment sorely pressed, the
mutiny having broken out in Lucknow.</p>
<p>General Wheeler's letter, however, was sent,
and it may be wondered how, when hemmed in
by a merciless and vigilant enemy, he could con-
trive to dispatch letters. Communications, how-
ever, continued to be conveyed until June 24,
when Lieutenant-Colonel Wiggins wrote the last
letter received from Cawnpore by messengers
retained by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Martin Gubbins, the financial
commissioner for Oudh. What answer Sir
<pb n="227"/>
Henry returned to General Wheeler's appeal for
aid is not known. Whatever it was, it must
have filled the brave old man with despair. Sir
Henry Lawrence, writing to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Tucker, the
Commissioner of Benares, on June 16, said:</p>
<p><q>I would risk the absence of so large a portion
of our small force, could I see the prospect of its
being able to succour Sir Hugh Wheeler. But
no individual here cognisant of facts—except
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gubbins—thinks that we could carry a single
man across the river, as the enemy holds all the
boats, and completely commands the river.
May God Almighty defend Cawnpore, for no
help can we afford!&#x2026; I have sent the pith
of this to Colonel Neill to urge him to relieve
Cawnpore, if in any way possible.</q></p>
<p>The words, <q>The enemy holds all the boats,
and completely commands the river,</q> were of
terrible significance, as will be seen later on, but
at the time Sir Henry wrote he only had regard
to the conveyance of troops. But they meant
more—far more—than this.</p>
<p>It was of course very early recognised that
the river was of supreme importance, and on
hearing of the outbreak at Cawnpore, Sir Henry
directed Captain Evans, the officer stationed at
Onao (twelve miles from Cawnpore), to secure
all the boats he could. But the mutineers had
forestalled us by breaking up the bridge at
Cawnpore, and taking possession of the boats
which had composed it, as well as those at other
ferries on the farther side of the stream. Thus
it will be evident that there was not a gleam of
hope anywhere? Forlorn indeed was the state
<pb n="228"/>
of the Cawnpore garrison, and heavy the thoughts
of Sir Hugh Wheeler.</p>
<p>Every day the position became more terrible,
for, failing in their attempts to take the entrench-
ment by storm, the rebels brought more heavy
guns from the magazine (if this magazine had
been blown up as the gallant Willoughby blew
up the magazine at Delhi!), and formed several
most formidable batteries under cover of the
night, as close as they could to the earthworks.</p>
<p>Eventually there were no fewer than seven of
these batteries, in addition to a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">nullah</foreign> a short
distance to the north-west of the entrenchment,
from which the enemy pushed on a sap, whence
they poured in a near and deadly fire, and from
this network of attack the rebels kept up their
fire day and night; the heaviest cannonading
being for about two hours in the morning, and
the same in the evening, when each gun would
throw between twenty and thirty shots an hour.
The aim, too, was rapidly improving, especially
as to the shells, which rarely overshot the mark.</p>
<p>June 13, the day before the expected succour
by Neill, was a memorable and fatal one in the
history of the siege. The enemy, failing to fire
the barracks by means of incendiaries, began to
use heated shells. At 5 <abbr>p.m.</abbr>, when the hopes of
relief were highest, a shell fired by a one-eyed
<choice><reg>soubadah</reg><orig>soubadhar</orig></choice> of artillery took effect. The marks-
man was a pensioner of the British, but he had
no gratitude, and he complacently pocketed
ninety rupees, which the Nana gave him for
bringing about the worst calamity which had
yet befallen the besieged, for the shell set fire
<pb n="229"/>
to the thatched roof, and, fanned by a strong
breeze, spread with appalling rapidity.</p>
<p>When Colonel Waring saw the column of fire
shoot upwards, followed by a roar and a crackle,
and the screams of the terrified women and
children, he was at the ramparts. Duty de-
manded that he should remain at his post, but
the thought that a frightful fate awaited Ruth
was too much for the old man. Flinging down
his rifle, and, feeble as he was, he hurried to
the blazing barrack. Those inmates who could
move were endeavouring to escape through the
only opening—a narrow doorway. They were
panic-stricken, and one woman had fainted,
blocking the way. The shrieks of those trying
to force their way out were heart-rending.</p>
<p>The old officer dashed at the huddled mass,
and seizing the woman nearest to hand dragged
her out. Then he went for another and another,
and by this time he had assistance—a slim active
figure in a tattered shirt and trousers, his face
and hands begrimed with powder. At last the
entrance was cleared, and those behind had now
a chance to escape.</p>
<p><said>Quick! quick!</said> shouted the Colonel.</p>
<p>He stood at one side of the door, so as not to
obstruct the outward rush; his newly arrived
companion stood at the other, and they did their
best to drag out the helpless ones. As Colonel
Waring laid hold of each new-comer, he cast a
hasty glance at her face. The one he sought he
could not find. Then his firmness gave way.</p>
<p><said>My God!</said> he gasped, <said>if she is to die, I
will die with her.</said></p>
<pb n="230"/>
<p>Frenziedly he made a dash for the interior,
to be stopped at the doorway by the man on the
other side, who flung his arms round the Colonel's
waist, and hurled him backwards.</p>
<p><said>Who are you?</said> shouted Waring. <said>Let
me go, or by Heaven I'll——</said></p>
<p>His disengaged hand went to his belt. But
he had not time to seize his revolver. His
assailant, with the adroitness of the expert
wrestler, gave the old colonel a Cumberland
<soCalled>backheel,</soCalled> and in a second the latter was
lying perfectly unhurt on the ground, and
before he had time to rise his assailant had dis-
appeared within the burning building. Here he
showed, could any one have seen him, method
in his madness. In a flash he had torn off one
of his tattered shirt sleeves, and holding the rag
to his nose and mouth, he crept farther and
farther into the hot, choking atmosphere. The
barrack was alight at the end away from the
door. The flames enabled him to see dimly the
shapeless forms of the poor victims who had
been unable to escape, and who had died—
mercifully, a painless death—of suffocation.</p>
<p>One woman was lying about a couple of yards
from where he was swaying under the effects of
the foul, poisonous air. He fancied he saw a
slight movement of the prostrate form, and
holding the rag tighter to his face with his left
hand, he stretched out his right arm as far as he
could reach, lying down his full length to do so.
His fingers clasped an arm thin and delicate as
that of a child. He dared not stand upright
for fear of fainting, and that would mean death
<pb n="231"/>
to him and to the girl or woman whose wrist
he was grasping. He slid backwards, propelling
himself by his left elbow, and by his knees and
feet, with a wriggling motion. His right hand
never let go its hold, and gently he drew the
woman towards the door. Whether he had
succeeded in reaching the opening he did not
know. A curious sensation of drowsy faintness,
in which all things earthly seemed crumbling
into chaos, crept over him. He knew no more.</p>
<p>But rescue was near at hand, though he was
unconscious of it. When he opened his eyes,
there was stout and tender-hearted John Mac-
Killop of the Civil Service kneeling by his side,
and moistening his forehead with a cloth dipped
in a pitcher of water.</p>
<p><said>Where am I?</said> came from his white lips.</p>
<p><said>Whaur are ye? In the devil's den I'm
thinking, puir laddie. I would I could say ye
were anywhere else,</said> said John sadly.</p>
<p><said>But she—I had hold of some one's arm!
Is she saved too?</said></p>
<p><said>Aye, aye, the puir lassie, though ye'd better
ha'eletherbide. It's only waking to more misery.</said></p>
<p><said>You're right; but tell me who is she?</said></p>
<p><said>Who is she? Who but Miss Ruth Armitage,
an'—</said></p>
<p>Dick Heron's eyes glistened.</p>
<p><said>Thank Heaven,</said> he muttered. <said>At least
I've shown her that I'd die for her.</said></p>
<p>MacKillop caught the words and looked at
him pityingly.</p>
<p><said>Weel, we're a' doing much the same for each
other, I'm thinking.</said></p>
<pb n="232"/>
<p>Yes, that was true, and no one had a better
right to say so than John MacKillop. It was
the duty of the brave fellow to fetch water from
the well in the centre of the entrenchment, the
only water-supply the garrison had. The well
was also a target for the enemy's artillery, so
that the appearance of a man with a pitcher by
day and by night, and the creaking of the tackle
were signals for a shower of grape. Many times
had MacKillop carried his life in his hands until
the journey came from which he never returned.
Just now, despite the hailstorm of bullets—for
the firing of the barrack had sent the rebels into
devilish joy—John MacKillop had once more
gone to the well, and brought water, to the
salvation of Ruth Armitage and Dick Heron.</p>
<p>But what was the safety of two lives in the
face of the appalling tragedy of that brief half
hour? Death had hitherto been contented
with single victims; but now there had been a
wholesale immolation. Panic did its work,
many of the wounded and sick could not be
removed, and about forty were left to their fate.</p>
<p>There was no time for thought of oneself.
Personal emotions, feelings, inclinations, love,
were crushed. Self-sacrifice was the one thought
uppermost. Dick, assured that Ruth was safe,
did not seek to see her—indeed, he could not.
As soon as he had pulled himself together he
went to the earthworks to take his share at the
guns or rifle.</p>
<p>The fateful day on which Neill was so con-
fidently expected—June 14—was marked by
a fiercer attack than the besieged had hitherto
<pb n="233"/>
experienced. On this day reinforcements arrived,
and the object evidently was to take the en-
trenchment by storm. Its capture was to be
the sequel to the firing of the barracks, but the
rebels failed, as they had failed before. Again
and again they tried to approach the feeble
rampart, but were each time met with a vigorous
fire from the batteries within, and at nightfall
they gave up the attempt.</p>
<p>All through the frightful time General Wheeler,
incapable of much active work, was thoughtful
and kind. He could do but little, yet when the
poor oppressed women saw his spare, worn,
shrunken figure near them, they felt cheered,
though they knew not why. He had taken his
post with the others in the defence, and shared
in the privations. There was no difference
between his lot and that of the private soldier.
After the fire the terrified women and children
were huddled together behind a couple of wa-
gons, and a heap of debris—packing cases,
broken furniture and rubbish from the barracks
—and here Sir Hugh found them. Like those of
every one else, Sir Hugh Wheeler's clothes were
dirty and torn, his face and hands were grimy,
and he looked more like a vagrant who had
tramped miles on a dusty road than a General
in the British Army.</p>
<p><said>There's only one place where at the moment
you can go—the trenches in the south corner,</said>
said he to the women. <said>The attack just now
is on the north and east. You'll be safe there.
When night comes you shall be moved to one of
the barracks outside.</said></p>
<pb n="234"/>
<p>The women heard this without a murmur,
though they knew it meant exposure to the
pitiless sun for two or three hours. Ruth was
lying on a mat in the shadow cast by a wagon,
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <choice><corr>Widdowson</corr><orig>Widowson</orig></choice>, the sturdy wife of a private of
the 32nd, fanning and moistening her forehead
with a damp rag. The General stopped and
looked pityingly at her.</p>
<p><said>Poor child,</said> said he compassionately. He
sighed deeply when he thought of his own
daughters, who were also in the entrenchment.</p>
<p>The girl was in a half-unconscious state, but the
voice of the General roused her. She struggled
into a sitting position, and, pushing back her
hair, which was streaming over her face, she cast
a wild glance of entreaty at the gallant old
soldier as he was moving away.</p>
<p><said>Sir Hugh,</said> she cried faintly, <said>do not go
yet. I want to speak to you.</said></p>
<p>The General turned and sat down on a box by
her side, so that she should not exhaust her
strength by having to speak loudly. It was
like his kindliness.</p>
<p><said>Sir Hugh,</said> said she, fixing her large, sad
eyes upon him, <said>how long is this horror to
last?</said></p>
<p><said>Why ask me, my dear? I am certain that
if our countrymen can reach us they will.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, yes; but they don't know how we are
situated.</said></p>
<p><said>That's the worst of it—they don't know.
Colonel Neill ought to be at Allahabad before
this. If we could only send a messenger to
him!</said></p>
<pb n="235"/>
<p><said>Yes; I've been thinking of that, General
Wheeler. Let me go!</said></p>
<p><said>Go? Go where?</said></p>
<p><said>To Allahabad. I can disguise myself as a
native woman. I can speak Hindustani as I
can my native tongue. Let me go!</said></p>
<p><said>Madness, my girl. You don't know what
you're saying. No woman can make her way
through that camp of tigers. You think because
you know the Hindustani language that you
also know the native manners and customs—
customs which have been handed down from
generation to generation. No, no; it would
never do.</said></p>
<p>Ruth made no reply. She felt the old General
was right.</p>
<p><said>Neill ought to be here to-morrow—at the
latest within a week,</said> went on General Wheeler.</p>
<p><said>And if not?</said></p>
<p><said>If not——</said> Sir Hugh drew a long breath.
<said>You are able to answer that question quite as
well as I can.</said></p>
<p>Again Ruth was silent, and the General was
about to rise from his seat when the girl grasped
his arm convulsively.</p>
<p><said>I don't believe help will ever reach us, Sir
Hugh—not, at least, before we are starved to
death.</said></p>
<p><said>We must hope for the best,</said> was all the
General could say.</p>
<p><said>Many of us are past hope. We would gladly
welcome death. I've been thinking there's one
way which might help us. You're quite right in
saying I could not get to Allahabad—I feel I
<pb n="236"/>
haven't the strength. But I might go to
Bithoor—to Azimoolah Khan.</said></p>
<p><said>Great Heavens! <emph>That</emph> man—that devil, I
ought to say! What are you talking about?</said></p>
<p>Ruth heard him unmoved. Her manner was
the manner of one who had made a vow, and had
sternly resolved to keep that vow. Without the
slightest quiver in her voice, she told simply,
almost mechanically, the story of Azimoolah
Khan's offer, before the siege began, to save her.</p>
<p><said>But,</said> exclaimed the General, <said>is it possible
you don't know what this offer meant?</said></p>
<p><said>I can guess,</said> said Ruth faintly, and with
downcast eyes. <said>I should probably not have
gone to Allahabad, as Azimoolah promised, but
to Bithoor—to the Nana's palace.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes,</said> said Sir Hugh with emphasis.</p>
<p><said>I've been thinking that if I now accepted
Azimoolah's offer he and the Nana might be
induced to draw away their forces and let you
and the others go free.</said></p>
<p><said>And do you imagine that I, an English
soldier, would consent to such a negotiation?</said>
cried Sir Hugh agitatedly. <said>No; our liberty
shall not depend upon such a sacrifice.</said></p>
<p><said>What does my life matter when the lives of
so many others would be saved?</said></p>
<p><said>Your life?</said> asked the old man, with a keen
and searching look.</p>
<p><said>Yes,</said> returned the girl, with a sad ghost of
a smile flitting over her brave face. <said>I should
but deceive Azimoolah and dupe the Nana.
When you were safely away I should kill myself.
It would be very easy.</said></p>
<pb n="237"/>
<p><said>Never—never—never,</said> cried Sir Hugh.
<said>My girl, if it be so willed that we die, the
sooner death comes the better. Dismiss such
thoughts from your mind.</said></p>
<p>The General spoke sternly, almost angrily. He
thoroughly grasped the meaning of Ruth's sug-
gestion, and he purposely roughened his tone to
repress what he knew was the outcome of
despair.</p>
<p><said>Do not mention such a thing again,</said> said he,
as he turned away, <said>or</said>—and a grim smile
lighted up his eyes and his tone softened—<said>I
shall have to order you tinder arrest, and I can
ill spare anybody for this purpose.</said></p>
<p><said>Poor girl—poor girl!</said> he muttered to
himself. <said>How will this terrible business end?</said></p>
<p>That was the question all those devoted men
and women were asking themselves. They had
been shut up in the entrenchment nine days,
and the time had been an eternity. The thou-
sand souls had been reduced by at least one-
fourth.</p>
<p>In her hurried talk with the General Ruth had
lighted upon the keynote of all the trouble—the
pangs of hunger and of thirst. The two things
together were gradually driving the poor creatures
mad.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the women and children (mostly
the wives and families of the privates of the
32nd regiment) been removed to the trenches—
almost the only places of shelter left—than one
poor woman, who was in a wretched state,
bordering on starvation, was seen to go out of
the protection of the mud wall with a child in
<pb n="238"/>
each hand, and stand where the fire was heaviest,
hoping that some bullet might relieve her and
her little ones from the troubles they were
enduring. She was brought back, poor thing,
to die a more tedious death.</p>
<p>In the barracks <choice><corr>outside</corr><orig>ouside</orig></choice> the entrenchment they
were worse off than inside the walls. To fetch
food from within the entrenchment meant
courting death, and after a time the gallant
little band endeavoured to depend upon foraging
outside the earthworks.</p>
<p>Now and then the larder was strengthened by
the addition of some horse-soup when the
enemy's cavalry came near enough to be <soCalled>potted.</soCalled>
It was of more importance to secure the horse than
the rider, and the latter might go scot free so that
the former was captured. Once a Brahmin bull
strolled within range. He was floored at once,
but he had to be brought in, and that was the
difficulty.</p>
<p>A volunteer party was instantly formed, and
Captain Moore, who was always present where
any daring work was to be done, led the foragers.
They took with them a strong rope, fastened it
round the hind legs and between the horns of
the beast, and in the midst of cheers from behind
the mud wall, and a sharp fusillade from tile
rebels, mingled with round shots, they accom-
plished their object. Two or three ugly wounds
were not thought too high a price to pay for
this contribution to the commissariat.</p>
<p>Once the defenders of <abbr>No.</abbr> 2 barrack saw the
sepoys bring a nine-pounder drawn by half a
dozen bullocks up to <abbr>No.</abbr> 6 barrack. Captain
<pb n="239"/>
Mowbray Thompson's men would have given a
right arm for a good cut out of the sides, and not
a few of their officers would have bartered a
letter of credit on the Army agents for the same
privilege.</p>
<p>But in vain; the sepoys managed to get the
bullocks under cover without coming into range.
Just as everybody was anathematising all the
bullocks and all the sepoys in creation, a weedy
horse belonging to one of the irregular cavalry
was spotted. In an instant half a dozen Enfield
rifles were levelled at the animal, and in less than
five minutes he was down, brought into the
barracks, and cut up. There was no skill
wasted. Lump, thump, whack, went nonde-
script pieces on to the fire, and there was not
one man there did not think roast horse the
most savoury meal he had ever tasted. The
two pickets, thirty-four in number, disposed of
the horse in two meals. The head and some
mysteries of the body were stewed, and the soup
sent into the entrenchments as a present to the
ladies.</p>
<p>Amid all this, death was ever present. Cap-
tain Halliday, who had come from the entrench-
ments to visit Captain Jenkins. was going back
with some of the horse-soup for his wife, when
he was shot down between the stone roof and
the mud wall.</p>
<p>Once a stray dog wandered from the sepoy
barrack, and every possible blandishment was
employed by our men to tempt the canine
adventurer into the soup-kettle. He yielded to
the temptation, and was served up steaming hot.
<pb n="240"/>
It was not every one, in spite of the pangs of
hunger, who could be induced to touch the dish.</p>
<p>The tortures of thirst were worse than those
of hunger. The well in the entrenchments, as
already mentioned, was one of the greatest
points of danger, as the enemy invariably fired
grape upon the spot the instant any person
made his appearance there to draw water. Even
in the dead of night the darkness afforded but
little protection, as the sepoys could hear the
creaking of the bucket; and at this well-known
sound they instantly opened fire.</p>
<p>MacKillop was the chief volunteer for the
fetching of water, but there were also paid men.
These were chiefly privates, who got as much
as eight or ten shillings a bucket. Poor fellows!
their earnings were of little avail to them; and
to their credit it must be said that when towards
the last days of the siege money had lost its value,
they were not less willing to incur the risk of
drawing for the women and the children. And
wearisome work it was, for the water was between
sixty and seventy feet from the surface of the
ground, and the mechanism was simply the
primitive method of hand-over-hand.</p>
<p>On the 15th, when night came on, the on-
slaught recommenced with renewed ferocity.
The enemy rushed onwards in hundreds, tinder
cover of the darkness, with the evident intention
of surrounding Ashe's battery, and taking it by
storm. But Captain Ashe was far too old a
soldier to be caught napping.</p>
<p><said>Let them come,</said> he muttered between his
teeth, <said>the more the merrier. No, no!</said> he
<pb n="241"/>
called out softly to his men, <said>not yet. Wait
till I give the word.</said></p>
<p>The sepoys could be seen in the gloom, stealing
along like savage animals in search for their
prey. The ground was literally covered with
them.</p>
<p><said>Not a word,</said> breathed Ashe in a whisper,
which his men heard, but which never went over
the earthworks.</p>
<p>The rebels were allowed to crawl within sixty or
eighty yards of the wall before a gun was fired
or a movement made to show that they were
seen. Just as they imagined their plan was
successful, and they rose to their feet to make
the charge, a nine-pounder, loaded with grape,
was discharged with appalling effect. The
scattering shot went right into their midst, and
was followed by a withering musketry fire, every
available man and gun having been concentrated
on this spot. With a howl of disappointment
and rage, the sepoys fell back. Their loss
amounted to some hundreds, and they had no
heart to renew the combat that night.</p>
<p>On the following day occurred an untoward
incident, which did more than anything else
to hurry the tragedy to its climax. It hap-
pened in this way: To the west of the en-
trenchment were three buildings. One of these
buildings was the quarter-guard, which, after
the burning of the thatched barrack, was used
for a hospital for sick and wounded. The other
two were sheds, called <soCalled>go-downs,</soCalled> and in these
were sheltered some of the wives and children
of the soldiers. Now, the quarter-guard was
<pb n="242"/>
also used as a prison, and here some half-dozen
sepoys (men who were under trial previous to the
outbreak, and who had been brought into the
entrenchment) were confined. Later on, had
such men (they were undoubted traitors) been
made prisoners, they would have been shot
without loss of time; but General Wheeler was
a humane man, and mistaken mercy was shown
them.</p>
<p>The fellows had been handcuffed and placed
in charge of a sentry, but when the attack of the
enemy grew fierce, this man had to take his turn
at the earthworks, and the prisoners were left
to be guarded by those wounded who were able
to move about. The result may be anticipated.
Three nights after the barrack was re-occupied
three men escaped, and the consequence was very
serious, for they immediately went to the Nana,
and gave him every information as to the dis-
tressed state of the garrison, and on the following
day, the 17th, the enemy's batteries commenced
firing, not only on the burnt barrack, but also
on the quarter-guard and the two go-downs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it seemed almost as though the
Fates were determined to prove of what British
pluck and British endurance are capable. Not
one bit of good luck did the besieged have all the
way though, while the sepoys, on the other
hand, were aided by persistently favourable
fortunes.</p>
<p>Thus, on the 17th the enemy began to run
short of percussion caps, and all the master
smiths and native gunmakers were seized to turn
the percussion locks into flint ones. Had this
<pb n="243"/>
state of things continued, the assault with
musket shot must gradually have slackened,
greatly to the advantage of the besieged. But
some malignant power of spite and cruelty seemed
to be watching over the mutineers, and just at
the right moment for them a fleet of about
twenty boats, laden with magazine stores and
ammunition, reached Cawnpore.</p>
<p>These stores were intended to reinforce the
British supplies, but the conductor on duty
unfortunately was not aware of what was going
on at Cawnpore till he came within four days'
journey of that station, when the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">zemindars</foreign>
(native farmers) and others, seized the boats
and sent them to the Nana. The two Europeans
(conductor and sergeant in charge) were mur-
dered without delay by order of the Nana, and
the stores taken into the magazine. The water
route up country is always very tedious, especi-
ally in the hot season, when the river is generally
very low. Thus it must have taken nearly a
month for this fleet to come up from Allahabad
to Cawnpore.</p>
<p>So, with this accession to the supplies, the
rebels renewed the attack with redoubled
ferocity. And no help had come to the be-
leaguered garrison, nor was there any likelihood
of any. But if Neill had only known! That
was the cruel part of the business. He had
succeeded in restoring order in Allahabad on
June 17, and had he had the slightest idea of
the state of affairs at Cawnpore, he would have
pushed on. He waited for Havelock. It was
then too late—too late!</p>

<head type="main">The End of the Siege</head>

<p>Towards the latter part of the siege the guns
had to be served by volunteers, the original
fifty-nine artillerymen having all been killed or
wounded. The guns themselves were terribly
battered. One howitzer was completely knocked
off its carriage; two had their sides driven in,
and a fourth was without a muzzle. At last
there were only two which by any ingenuity
could be made to carry grape, and these were
loaded in a most eccentric manner.</p>
<p>In consequence of the irregularity of the bore
of the guns, through the damage inflicted, the
canister could not be driven home. But woman's
wit was equal to the necessity. They took off
their stockings, and the contents of the canisters
were emptied into the stockings, which were
thus converted into a species of cartridge,
novel but effective.</p>
<p>Every contrivance that experience could sug-
gest, or ingenuity devise, was made use of. A
small gun in barrack <abbr>No.</abbr> 1 in possession of the
enemy, was particularly objectionable to Lieu-
tenant Delafosse, who, being compelled to load
his nine-pounder with six-pound shot, could
never be sure of his mark. Delafosse did not
<pb n="245"/>
know what fear was, and whenever the gun was
fired, he always jumped upon the heel of the
carriage to satisfy himself that his shot had done
some damage. Scores and scores of times he
showed himself above the wall, but he seemed
to bear a charmed life, for he not only surveyed
the horrors of the siege, but ultimately escaped.
At length the enemy's little gun exhausted his
patience.</p>
<p><said>Confound it!</said> he exclaimed angrily, when
for about the thirteenth time his shot went wide
of the mark, <said>I'll silence that little beast,
or be silent myself ever after.</said></p>
<p>He gave his worn-out gun a monster charge,
consisting of three six-pound shots and a
stockingful of grape, all well rammed down.
The faithful old gun did not burst, as might
reasonably have been expected; the grape went
straight to its destination, and the troublesome
little antagonist was heard of no more.</p>
<p>But this piece of success was due to skill, and
not to good luck. All the good luck went to the
rebels, and all the bad to the British. Even
the very elements seemed to have a deadly
spite against the cooped-up garrison. This year
the <soCalled>hot wind</soCalled> was of exceptional intensity.
At times it was like the continuous blast of a
heated furnace, and loaded as it was with a fine
irritating dust, the torture, especially to the sick
and wounded, was indescribable.</p>
<p>At night every one who was at all capable of
moving had to turn out into the trenches. Here
they were divided into watches, and did their
best to sleep when they were relieved. It
<pb n="246"/>
seems almost incredible that amid the incessant
rattle and thunder of musket and cannon,
they could do so, but their fatigue and exhaustion
were so great that they no sooner laid down
on their hard beds than slumber mercifully
came to their rescue. In many instances that
slumber was their last, for throughout the night
the rebels kept up the bombardment, and the
shells continually found their victims.</p>
<p>The morning of June 21 was destined to usher
in a most terrible day. The suspicion got abroad
that a fierce attack was contemplated, and this
suspicion was soon fully confirmed. Shortly
after daybreak a vast mob was seen approaching
the entrenchment from all sides. They were
sepoys from various regiments, dressed in odds
and ends of uniforms. A number of Oudh
soldiery, once in the service of the deposed King
Wazid Ali, ragged ruffians all of them, had joined
the rebel forces, and at the lowest computation
the enemy was not less than six thousand strong.
Among other odd scraps of information, obtained
through spies, was one that the leader of this
fresh attack, a newly created <choice><reg>soubadah</reg><orig>soubadhar</orig></choice>-major,
had sworn upon the <soCalled>Ganga Jal</soCalled> (Ganges
water) either to take the entrenchment or die.</p>
<p>The assault commenced with the enemy's
batteries opening simultaneously a tremendous
iron storm from all quarters. The attack was
the only one where the rebels had a recognised
commander—the <choice><reg>soubadah</reg><orig>soubadhar</orig></choice>-major, already
mentioned, a man of more than ordinary stature,
and of enormous strength. The day is also
noteworthy in another respect; the natives
<pb n="247"/>
went back to primitive modes of battle. Throw-
ing large bales of cotton before them, they lay
behind, and endeavoured to advance under
cover, about a hundred sepoys succeeding in
this way in approaching to within 150 yards
of the entrenchment wall. This was intended
as a preliminary to the attack, for shortly after
the men in the rear of the advance guard, utter-
ing frightful yells, sprang upon the walls, led by
the <choice><reg>soubadah</reg><orig>soubadhar</orig></choice>-major. The attack was a com-
plete failure. At the very first discharge of our
musketry the <choice><reg>soubadah</reg><orig>soubadhar</orig></choice> fell dead, and the rest
went no farther.</p>
<p>Shortly after the rout a most daring deed was
done by gallant Lieutenant Delafosse. About
midday one of the ammunition wagons in the
south-east corner was blown up by the enemy's
shell, and whilst it was blazing the rebel batteries
opened fire upon it. The men were frightfully
exhausted with the morning's work, and with
almost every artilleryman either killed or
wounded, assistance was not at hand, and the
fire was endangering the other wagons. Dela-
fosse never hesitated a moment. Flinging himself
under the burning wagon, he pulled away
from it whatever loose timber he could get hold
of, meanwhile throwing earth on the flames. He
was then joined by two soldiers, who had brought
with them a couple of buckets of water which
was very dexterously thrown about by the lieu-
tenant, and in spite of the cannonading the fire
was extinguished, and Delafosse escaped unhurt.</p>
<p>It was on this day, the 21st, that the last letter
sent from the doomed stronghold was written
<pb n="248"/>
by Major Vibart, and dispatched to Lucknow.
He wrote:</p>
<p><q>Any aid to be effective must be immediate.
In the event of rain falling our position would be
untenable. According to telegraphic dispatches
received previous to the outbreak, 1,000 Euro-
peans were to have been here on the 14th.
This force may be on its way up. Any assistance
you can send might co-operate with it. We
have lost about a third of our original number.
The enemy are strongest in artillery. They
move their guns with great difficulty on account
of the unbroken hillocks. The infantry are great
cowards, and are easily repulsed.</q></p>
<p>This brief, comprehensive, soldier-like epistle
was dated <q>Sunday night, 12 p.m.</q> It does
not breathe of surrender; and we may be sure
there was no thought of anything of the kind in
the mind of the gallant soldier when he penned
this last appeal; but ill fortune dogged the hap-
less men and women. Surrender had to come.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, it has always been
thought that June 23, the centenary of the battle
of Plassy, was to have been the date of a simul-
taneous outbreak, had not the rising been hastened
by the precipitation shown at Meerut. How-
ever this may be, a renewal of the great pre-
parations which had so signally failed on the 21st
was intended to mark the date of the 23rd.</p>
<p>Captain Thomson anticipated something of
the kind, and he was not surprised when on the
night of the 22nd he and his gallant little band
in <abbr>No.</abbr> 2 barrack were threatened by a storming
party from <abbr>No.</abbr> 1. The look out could see the
<pb n="249"/>
sepoys gathering to this position from all parts,
and fearing his men would be overpowered by
numbers, Thomson sent Dick Heron to Captain
Moore for more men.</p>
<p><q>Not one can be spared,</q> was the answer,
not unexpected. Shortly afterwards, however,
Moore came across with Delafosse.</p>
<p><said>Thomson,</said> said Moore, <said>I've a notion of
a new dodge. Suppose we go out into the open,
and I give the word of command as though we
were heading a party of attack? We might
give the niggers a scare and do some damage.</said></p>
<p>The idea was approved, and Moore with a
sword, and Delafosse and Heron with muskets,
forthwith sallied out.</p>
<p><said>Number one to the front!</said> shouted Moore
in his loudest tones, <said>Number two right about.
Steady, my lads, and fire at the word of com-
mand!</said></p>
<p>The effect was electrical. Hundreds of ammu-
nition pouches rattled on the bayonet sheaths as
the frightened foes vaulted from the cover
afforded by heaps of rubbish, and rushed helter-
skelter into the safe quarters presented by the
barrack walls. Thomson's men followed them
up with a vigorous salute; and as they did not
show fight there was a hearty laugh at the
ingenuity which had devised the successful ruse,
and the courage with which it had been executed.</p>
<p>Moore was always full of daring. Soon after
the burning of the thatched barrack a party,
headed by this brave fellow, went out at midnight
towards the church compound, where they spiked
two or three guns. Then they crept away to
<pb n="250"/>
the mess-house, killed several of the native
gunners, whom they found asleep at their posts,
blew up one of the 24-pounders, and spiked
another. The pity of it was that this dashing
exploit availed the besieged but little, for the
next day fresh guns were brought into position,
while of Moore's party engaged in the spiking
enterprise one private was killed and four
wounded.</p>
<p>All through the night of the 22nd came a series
of attacks which were not meant to lead to
anything beyond keeping the defenders in a
constant state of suspense, and not a man left
his post for a second. Toward dawn, when there
was a little cessation, Mainwaring, a cavalry
cadet, one of Captain Thomson's pickets,
volunteered to keep a sharp look-out with
Dick Heron, while their commander took a little
rest. Thomson was only too glad of the offer,
but had scarcely closed his eyes before Main-
waring shouted:</p>
<p><said>Here they come!</said></p>
<p>The assailants advanced close up to the door-
way of <abbr>No.</abbr> 2 barrack, which had no door, but
was protected by a line of brickwork about
breast high. Never had the enemy shown so
much pluck. No doubt they relied upon the
besieged being utterly exhausted. They were
soon undeceived. Mainwaring's revolver dis-
patched two or three; Dick was equally lucky;
Stirling, with his unerring Enfield, shot one and
bayoneted another, and Thomson emptied his
double-barrelled gun, and not in vain. The men
inside the barrack numbered seventeen, and the
<pb n="251"/>
enemy left eighteen corpses outside when they
retreated.</p>
<p>While the barrack was being attacked a de-
termined onslaught was made upon the entrench-
ment. The sepoys swarmed like flies. They
surrounded the wall on all sides, and in every
style of uniform, together with horse and bullock
batteries of field artillery sent out as skirmishers.
Their attack was ruined by their ignorance.
They did not know what to do with their forces.
Their cavalry started at once for the charge, but
whether through their impetuosity or the incom-
petence of their leader, the troopers came all the
way at a hurried gallop, so that when they reached
the entrenchment their horses were winded: a
round of artillery threw their ranks into hopeless
confusion, and all who did not bite the dust
wheeled round and went off helter-skelter.</p>
<p>This day was intended to bring the siege to
an end. The men had started with the idea of
killing every soul or dying in the attempt. Oaths
of solemnity had been taken; but all their vows
came to nought so soon as one of the British
batteries lodged a charge in their midst.</p>
<p>About three o'clock in the afternoon, the sting
of the attack of the enemy having been thor-
oughly taken out, the firing of the pickets of the
outside barracks abated. Indeed, for two hours
the rebels scarcely fired a shot, and the defenders
were much puzzled by their inactivity. Dick
Heron was for the time being the look-out man
in the crow's nest erected by Captain Thomson
in <abbr>No.</abbr> 2 barrack. Suddenly he shouted:</p>
<p><said>There's a woman coming across!</said></p>
<pb n="252"/>
<p>One of the pickets thought she was a spy, and
would have shot her, but Captain Thomson
knocked down his arm and saved her life. The
woman had a child at her breast, but was so
imperfectly clothed as to be without shoes and
stockings. Captain Thomson lifted her over the
barricade in a fainting condition, and to his
amazement recognised her as <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenway, a
member of a wealthy family who had resided at
Cawnpore.</p>
<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenway was the widow of the pro-
prietor of the <title>Cawnpore Gazette</title>. The family, on
the appearance of the Mutiny, fled to Nuzzuff-
ghur, where they had a factory, in the belief
that their own villagers would be quite able to
protect them from any serious injury. These pre-
cautions were, however, utterly useless, as they
fell into the Nana's hands. One of the members
of this family paid the Nana three lacs of rupees
if he would spare the lives of the entire house-
hold: the unprincipled monster took the ransom,
but murdered all the Greenways, as already
related, with the exception of the aged lady who
so unexpectedly appeared to Captain Thomson.</p>
<p>The poor woman was in a fainting condition
when she arrived, and it was some time before
she could speak. When she was able to do so,
she handed Captain Thomson a letter with this
superscription:</p>
<p><q>To the Subjects of Her Most Gracious
Majesty Queen Victoria.</q></p>
<p>Captain Thomson opened the letter and read
the following: <q>All those who are in no way
connected with the acts of Lord Dalhousie, and
<pb n="253"/>
are willing to lay down their arms shall receive
a safe passage to Allahabad.</q></p>
<p>He handed the letter to General Wheeler.</p>
<p><said>We cannot recognise this,</said> said the old
General. <said>There's no signature attached. The
writing is clearly Azimoolah's, but that's not
enough. It may be a ruse.</said></p>
<p>There was ample cause for General Wheeler's
suspicions. Only a few days before, great ex-
citement was caused by the arrival in the en-
trenchment of a native spy, who came in the garb
of a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">bhistee</foreign>, or water-carrier. This fellow de-
clared himself to be a friend, and said he had
brought good news. And good news indeed it
would have been had it been true.</p>
<p><said>Two companies of European soldiers are on
the other side of the river,</said> said he. <said>They
have brought a couple of guns from Lucknow,
and they are about to cross the Ganges. To-
morrow you will see them.</said></p>
<p>A present was made him, and he was sent out
to get more particulars. The next day he came
again and told General Wheeler that the Euro-
pean soldiers were prevented crossing the stream
by the rising of the river, but that they were
constructing rafts, and might be looked for in a
day or two.</p>
<p>The tidings spread, and lighted some flickering
rays of hope, even in the bosoms of the most
despairing, although there were not a few who
doubted the man's story, for the rainy season,
though near at hand, had not commenced, and
how could the river rise? Time proved they
were right. Days rolled on, and the delusion was
<pb n="254"/>
dispelled like the mirage. This pretended friend
was in fact one of the Nana's spies, and the tidings
he conveyed back of the pitiable condition of the
defenders must have caused the eyes of his atro-
cious employer to gleam with malignant joy.</p>
<p>While <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenway was on her mission, the
guns of the rebel batteries remained inactive,
and in a little time the lady was safely brought
from the barracks to General Wheeler's quarters.
In spite of her age, her courage was unabated.</p>
<p><said>This paper is not signed, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenway,</said>
said the General. <said>How can we act upon it?</said></p>
<p><said>It was given me by Azimoolah Khan. I will
take it back to him and tell him what you say,</said>
replied the old lady undauntedly.</p>
<p><said>No, no; it is too terrible a risk. The scoundrel,
out of mere spite, may kill you.</said></p>
<p><said>I am not afraid of death—I have been too
near it so many times,</said> said the brave woman.
<said>Give me the paper, and let me go.</said></p>
<p>General Wheeler grasped <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenway's
hand, and Captain Moore and Captain Whiting
escorted her to the entrenchment wall. Here
a white flag was hoisted, and the anxious men
watched her disappear into the mutineers' camp.</p>
<p>When she was gone, the message from the
Nana was the only subject upon which the poor
creatures could think or talk. The men, wasted
spectres as they were, preferred taking their
chance, and, as a last resource, cutting their way
through, when the remains of their miserable
fortification no longer afforded them any protec-
tion. But how could they leave the women and
children?</p>
<pb n="255"/>
<p>On the other hand, it was certain that, unless
help arrived within a couple of days or so, they
must, if they remained within the entrenchments,
inevitably be slaughtered. There was also
another calamity shadowing them—the rainy
season. The cooped-up defenders dreaded
nothing so much as the setting in of the rain,
which was expected daily. In the first place,
the holes dug in the trenches for the protection
of the women and children would be filled up.
In the second place, the barracks, which, though
thoroughly riddled, still afforded some shelter,
would be in danger of coming down, for the
soddened walls would no longer hold together.
Then, again, the muskets would be rendered
useless, for there were a great many of them,
and the men were quite unable to clean them all.
Lastly, there was the mud wall itself. A few
tropical showers would wash it away.</p>
<p>While <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenway was gone, General
Wheeler consulted with his officers how to act.
He was reluctant to surrender, and so were the
younger officers, but Captain Moore took a
different view. No one could question Captain
Moore's courage, much less his fortitude, and
what he said undoubtedly had great weight.
Besides, he was the very life and breath of the
beleaguered band, and had sustained them many
a time when they were tempted to despair.</p>
<p><said>Think of the women,</said> said he, his voice
vibrating with emotion. <said>Are they not almost
maddened by suffering? At least half of our
fighting force are gone. Of our fifty-nine artillery
men, not six remain. What hope is there for us?</said></p>
<pb n="256"/>
<p>The argument was irresistible.</p>
<p><said>Very well,</said> said Sir Hugh slowly, after a
pause. <said>What must be, must. If <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenway
returns with a properly signed message, we will
treat with the Nana.</said></p>
<p>In evening <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenway returned with
another letter, and this was taken to the General.</p>
<p><said>Impossible!</said> he exclaimed, knitting his
white brows. <said>The Nana requires us to evacuate
the entrenchments to-night.</said></p>
<p>An answer was returned to the effect that the
departure must be delayed until the morrow,
upon which came back a peremptory message,
that the Nana had made up his mind, and that
if there were any hesitation on the part of Sir
Hugh Wheeler he would open fire once more.
He added that he was fully acquainted with the
impoverishment of the garrison, and that he
knew their guns were shattered. Moore refused
to be intimidated. He replied that he was not
afraid of the sepoys entering the entrenchments,
as the latter had always been beaten back, but
if they did succeed, there were men ready at
the magazine to blow up the defenders and the
enemy. This argument convinced the Nana.
He agreed to wait until the following morning.</p>
<p>The preliminaries settled, the General, Moore
and the other officers, arranged the terms of the
treaty. They ran thus: <q>That the garrison
should give up their guns, ammunition, and
treasure; should be allowed to carry their
muskets and sixty rounds of cartridges with
them; that the Nana should provide carriages
for the sick, wounded, women, and children, to
<pb n="257"/>
the river's bank, where boats should be in
readiness to convey all to Allahabad.</q></p>
<p>The next morning two men were seen coming
from the Nana's camp. One of the men was
Juwallah Pershawd, brigadier of the Nana's
cavalry, and the other was Azimoolah Khan.
Juwallah was one of the Nana's retinue, and
was Azimoolah's confidential ally. When they
reached a distance of about 200 yards from
Captain Thomson's barracks, they made signs,
and Captain Moore went to meet them, and
brought them into the barracks. They were
followed by some of the Mussulman troopers of
the 32nd Light Cavalry.</p>
<p><said>Shall we talk in English, Captain Moore?</said>
asked Azimoolah Khan, in silky tones.</p>
<p><said>As you please,</said> returned Moore, coldly.</p>
<p>At this the troopers began to murmur. They
did not understand English, so they said. Ac-
cordingly, the negotiations were conducted in
Hindustani, and Azimoolah finally departed
with the treaty. The same afternoon the
document came back unsigned, accompanied
by the verbal message that the Nana agreed to
the terms. Sir Hugh Wheeler, however, insisted
upon the Nana's signature being affixed, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Todd, a civilian, volunteered to take the docu-
ment to the Secundah Kothi, the Nana's head-
quarters. In half an hour he came back, report-
ing that he had been courteously received, and
that the Nana had signed the treaty without
hesitation.</p>
<p>Then the preparations for the evacuation
began, and the poor creatures who had suffered
<pb n="258"/>
such tortures, both mental and bodily, felt that
at last the black pall which had enshrouded
them for so long was about to be lifted. They
were allowed to walk freely out of the entrench-
ments; and that evening, and before sunset,
the shattered guns which had worked such fearful
havoc among the rebels were handed over to
the Nana, and a company of native artillery
stood over them the whole night—men who had
been in the service of the Company, and who
had been drilled at these very guns.</p>
<p>A committee of three was appointed to go
down to the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">ghaut</foreign> to see if the boats were in
readiness, and all the necessary preparations
made, and in their exchange three native officials
were sent as hostages. Among them was Ju-
wallah Pershawd. He was taken to Sir Hugh
Wheeler, and in a smooth voice began to express
his sympathy at seeing him, at his time of life,
and a general officer, too, in such a sad condition.</p>
<p><said>You need not trouble yourself concerning
me,</said> said the General curtly.</p>
<p>Sir Hugh was sitting in the shadow of the
barracks. His daughters and his wife and Ruth
were with him. It went to his heart to see the
native artillery men standing guard over the
guns which had done such good service; but
the brave old man scorned to betray his feelings
before the Nana's envoys. His face was like
flint. The obsequious Oriental bowed deferenti-
ally, and without noticing the rebuff, went on
to say that he should take special care no harm
came to him.</p>
<p><said>Or to the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">mem-sahibs</foreign> either,</said> he added,
<pb n="259"/>
his dark, treacherous eyes resting for a moment
on the women.</p>
<p>Finding Sir Hugh indisposed to talk, the man
rose after a while, and as he passed Ruth stopped
for a moment, and looked fixedly at her.</p>
<p><said>You are Miss Ruth Armitage?</said> said he
suddenly, and in perfect English.</p>
<p><said>And what then?</said> answered the girl.</p>
<p><said>You, at least, have nothing to fear,</said> said he,
dropping his voice to a whisper. <said>That is
Azimoolah's message of peace to you.</said></p>
<p><said>Azimoolah is nothing to me,</said> retorted Ruth,
her pallid face a little flushed.</p>
<p><said>Aha!</said> smiled the man, <said>we will see!</said></p>
<p>The terrible scenes Ruth had gone through,
the absence of rest, the want of food, and con-
tinual strain on the nerves, had not weakened
the girl's spirit. Flashing a look of scorn at the
obsequious Juwallah, she left him and went in
search of Colonel Waring, who had that morning
been stricken down by a slight attack of sun-
stroke, and had been taken to the apology for a
hospital. Now that the firing had ceased, the
remains of the thatched barrack could be utilised,
and here the old man had been conveyed.</p>
<p>For the first time for three weeks Ruth was
able to cross from one barrack to the other
without the risk of being shot. Round the well,
to reach which so many men had sacrificed life
and limb, was clustered a thirsty group. Never
did nectar taste so delicious as those draughts of
water, cloudy though it was with the bricks and
mortar disturbed by shot and shell and pre-
cipitated into the spring. The poor people never
<pb n="260"/>
seemed able to drink their fill, and down went
the buckets times out of number that day.</p>
<p>As Ruth reached the shattered verandah she
met one of the surgeons coming out of the
<choice><reg>doorway</reg><orig>door-way</orig></choice>.</p>
<p><said>How is Colonel Waring, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Sargeant?</said>
she inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>The surgeon took her hand in his, and looked
kindly and pityingly in her eyes.</p>
<p><said>Colonel Waring is more fortunate than the
rest of us. He is at peace, Miss Armitage.</said></p>
<p><said>Dead?</said> she cried.</p>
<p>The surgeon bowed his head.</p>
<p><said>I don't think we should mourn his fate,</said>
said he gently.</p>
<p><said>No, no,</said> she repeated hurriedly. <said>No one
here can wish for life, and yet we struggle for
it.</said></p>
<p>She tried to speak calmly, but the effort was
beyond her strength. She leant against the
support of the verandah, and covering her face
with her hands, wept bitterly. The surgeon
gazed at her with tender sympathy in his grave
eyes, and moved softly away. What could he
do to cheer or comfort her?</p>
<p>But it was not so much grief at the death of
the brave old colonel which so oppressed her.
He was past all human suffering now, and was
really to be envied. It was the horrible sense
of being utterly desolate and forlorn which filled
her with dark despair. What was to be her own
fate? <emph>That</emph> was the terrible problem ever
before her eyes.</p>

<head type="main">A Sad Exodus</head>

<p>It was now June 26, and the following day was
appointed for the departure. The firing had
ceased on June 24, and it was wonderful to see
what a change had already taken place in the
look of the poor creatures. Worn and emaciated
and weak they were still, but they had been able
to wash~~the first time since the guns of Nana
Sahib opened fire on the 6th of June. Some had
managed to secure a change of clothes, but most
of them wore their old tattered garments. As for
food, there was no variation save a double ration
of chupatties and dhal. Captain Moore dis-
dained to ask the enemy for assistance in this
direction, and none was proffered.</p>
<p>Ruth met the daughters of General Wheeler
just outside the barracks. The two girls were
greatly attached to each other, and their de-
votion to their father and mother throughout
the siege never slackened. The prospect of a
speedy release had put them in good spirits.</p>
<p><said>We ought to be at Allahabad within a week!</said>
exclaimed the eldest. <said>It will be terribly hot
on the river, but I shall not mind that in the joy
of getting free from this dreadful place!</said></p>
<pb n="262"/>
<p><said>Aren't you glad, Ruth?</said> said her sister.</p>
<p><said>Yes, indeed. If only poor Colonel Waring
had lived——</said></p>
<p><said>Ah, he is gone then!</said> said the girl gently,
but in no way surprised. They were so used to
hear of deaths.</p>
<p><said>Yes,</said> answered Ruth in a dull, stunned way.</p>
<p><said>I am so sorry for you, dear. You will keep
with us, won't you?</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, yes.</said></p>
<p><said>We leave here to-morrow. You know that,
Ruth, of course. The committee went down to
the river this morning, and we expect them back
before sunset,</said> said Miss Wheeler.</p>
<p>Captain Athill Turner and Lieutenants Dela-
fosse and Good were the committee appointed
to inspect the arrangements made by the Nana
for the reception of the British. They proceeded
to the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">ghauts</foreign> attended by an escort of native
cavalry, and examined the boats. Forty craft
were moored off the bank, and the committee
saw nothing to excite their suspicions.</p>
<p>Some of these boats were open, and others
were roofed, some with wood and others with
thatch. Those which were open were in course
of being roofed—a very important matter, as to
travel under the rays of the fierce sun would
simply mean death to the men and women
already exhausted by fatigue and starvation.
They were about thirty feet long and twelve
broad, and were ordinary up-country craft. On
board some of the boats provisions were being
conveyed, and the coolies were apparently work-
ing with zeal. How could the committee tell
<pb n="263"/>
that when their backs were turned all these
stores would be taken ashore again?</p>
<p>The officers finished their inspection and pre-
pared to return to the entrenchment. The
banks were lined with sepoys, mostly belonging
to the 50th Native Infantry, and the three
Englishmen could not help noticing the sinister
expression on the faces of many.</p>
<p><said>Did you hear that?</said> suddenly asked
Captain Turner of Lieutenant Good.</p>
<p><said>Hear what?</said></p>
<p><said>What that man said. I am sure the word
was <foreign xml:lang="hi">kuttle</foreign></said> (massacre).</p>
<p>Good listened, but without appearing to do
so. He, too, heard the ominous word spread
like a low hiss from man to man.</p>
<p><said>You're quite right,</said> returned Good. <said>I
don't like it. We must keep a sharp look-out,
though what we can do now Heaven alone
knows!</said></p>
<p>The committee reported to Sir Hugh Wheeler
and Captain Moore the result of their visit, and
also mentioned what they had heard. To
neither the General nor to his second in command
did it convey anything sinister. The men might
have been talking about some other massacre.</p>
<p><said>I hope it is so,</said> said Captain Turner, <said>but
I have my doubts.</said></p>
<p><said>Whether or not,</said> said Sir Hugh Wheeler,
<said>we can only depend on our muskets. Our
guns are gone.</said></p>
<p>The poor General sighed, and no wonder. To
surrender artillery is the bitterest sacrifice a
General can make. Yet what else could he do?
<pb n="264"/>
Meanwhile the rebels had been greatly concerned
at the delay in the departure of the garrison.
They said:</p>
<p><said>Now that the Europeans have washed and
dressed, and have had time to rest, they will not
go away at all. They have held out so long now
they will be able to hold out longer.</said></p>
<p>But the cause of the delay was not the fault
of the English, who were only too anxious to
take their departure. No one knew, no one
suspected, that Bala Rao, Nana Sahib's brother,
and Azimoolah Khan were then deliberating
over an act of fiendish treachery and that they
required time to mature their plans. Even the
sepoys were not aware of this, and it was to
satisfy them that the guns and the treasure were
taken away on the morning of the 26th.</p>
<p>The three officers, on leaving General Wheeler,
were surrounded by the ladies, anxious to know
their opinion as to the state of affairs.</p>
<p><said>Do you think it will be all right to-morrow?</said>
asked <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ewart.</p>
<p><said>I have no reason to think otherwise,</said> said
Captain Turner, guardedly.</p>
<p>He did not say anything about overhearing
the word <q xml:lang="hi">kuttle.</q></p>
<p><said>But will they really let us go down to
Allahabad in safety?</said> asked Ruth.</p>
<p>Somehow she had a presentiment that they
had not seen the last of their terrible trials.</p>
<p><said>I hope so—I really believe so,</said> answered
Turner.</p>
<p>And with this the poor things had to be
satisfied.</p>
<pb n="265"/>
<p>That was the last night they spent in the
entrenchment, and they slept soundly—oh, so
soundly! The stillness, in contrast to the con-
tinual uproar to which they had been subjected,
seemed unnatural. The silence was profound,
oppressive—ominous.</p>
<p>Yet it did not pass without one interruption.
Juwallah Pershawd had caused a strong guard of
cavalry and infantry to be placed all round, with
the plausible excuse of guarding the place—
though, in reality, it was done to prevent the
possibility of any one escaping during the night.
Suddenly a musket shot from <abbr>No.</abbr> 1 barrack
awoke the echoes. It was enough for the enemy.
They immediately opened fire on the entrench-
ment. The force within stood perfectly quiet,
and never returned a shot. In spite of all they
had gone through, their faculties were completely
under command. They knew that the least
piece of rashness on their part would convert
the men outside into savages. Meanwhile,
Juwallah went to the barrack, and discovered
the cause. A sleepy sepoy had dropped his
musket, and it had gone off. Explanations were
sent, and after this all was quiet again.</p>
<p>From this time to dawn the only sounds which
broke the stillness were the growling of the
jackals and the shrieks of the vultures and
adjutant birds. Every night these scavengers of
the earth had been on the watch, but the noise
of the guns kept them at a distance. Now they
were permitted to ravage undisturbed.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of Saturday June 27
all was astir. The evacuation was to commence
<pb n="266"/>
at six; and though many of the women and
children had to be awakened, not one grudged
the loss of sleep, though they had to be roused
forcibly, so heavy was their slumber.</p>
<p>At sunrise a number of carts, palanquins,
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dhoolies</foreign>, and elephants arrived. They had been
sent by the Nana for the transport of the women,
the sick, and the wounded. The elephant gener-
ally used by General Wheeler, with its howdah
and driver, was brought and was occupied by
Lady Wheeler and her two daughters and Ruth
Armitage, while the General, not feeling disposed
to look conspicuous, rode on horseback.</p>
<p>Slowly the party filed out between the ranks
of sepoys who looked on—with what thoughts,
who can tell? Over a thousand souls were shut
up within on June 4; not more than 450 came
out on the 27th. All the rest had perished.</p>
<p>It was a truly sad spectacle. That noble
little band, worn to shadows, had, for twenty
long days, in the hottest season of the year, kept
at bay a blood-thirsty foe to be numbered by
thousands; their sole defence a low wall, barely
four feet high, with a shallow ditch, not worthy
the name of an entrenchment. They had
yielded not through any submission of their
will or weakness of their brave hearts, but out
of compassion to the weak and to the helpless,
and with the vain hope of shortening suffering.</p>
<p>Slowly and painfully the procession toiled
along. Many of the women had brought with
them little articles of property, some intrinsically
worthless, others of considerable value, but all
endeared by memorials of love to the various
<pb n="267"/>
owners. Tattered and torn, weak and wounded,
they hastened on with eager steps and beating
hearts to the cruel fate awaiting them, all un-
conscious of the base treachery which was being
planned by Azimoolah Khan and Bala Rao, with
or without the consent of the Nana.</p>
<p>The whole of the rebel army had assembled to
see the English depart, and no sooner was the
last man out than, with a fiendish yell, they
rushed into the entrenchment, swarming in
crowd after crowd, till nearly 8,000 men were
jostling each other within the mud wall. They
were eager for loot, but very little worth taking
did they find in the skeleton barracks. In the
hurry of departure, and for want of sufficient
carriages, some twelve helpless patients were left
behind, not with the intention of being aban-
doned, but to be sent for as soon as the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dhoolies</foreign>
could be spared. These hapless creatures were
dragged out into the centre of the entrenchment,
and after being abused and mocked, were cruelly
butchered.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the sepoys outside urged on the
fugitives with encouraging cries.</p>
<p><said>Come to the boats! All is ready!</said> they
shouted.</p>
<p>The able-bodied men loaded themselves with
as much ammunition as they could carry, and
walked down indiscriminately after the advance
guard. This guard consisted of some men of the
32nd, led by the brave Captain Moore. The
women and children were put on the elephants
and into bullock carts, while the sick and disabled
were conveyed in the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dhoolies</foreign> and palanquins.
<pb n="268"/>
Never, surely, was there such an emaciated,
ghostly party of human beings.</p>
<p>Soon the waters of the Ganges could be seen
gleaming in the distance. The tops of the roofed
boats were also visible, and, gladdened by the
sight, the poor creatures hastened onwards.
Happy, perhaps, were they that the future was
a sealed book. Could they have pictured what
was to take place within the next few hours,
what indescribable mental torture would have
been theirs!</p>

<head type="main">The Massacre of the Boats</head>

<p>The distance from the entrenchment to the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">ghaut</foreign>
on the Ganges, where lay the boats which the
released garrison expected were to convey them
in safety to Allahabad, was about two miles.
After much painful labour—for the heat was
great, and many were so weak they could
scarcely walk—the sad procession reached the
wooden bridge over a ravine which at this point
runs into the Ganges. Proceeding along the
road; they turned aside into another ravine which
led to the Suttee Choura Ghaut. Here they
found the boats awaiting them; but, alas, with
but few exceptions these boats had been hauled
into the shallows.</p>
<p><said>These boats have been shifted!</said> exclaimed
Captain Turner angrily. <said>They're not where
they were when we saw them. Does it mean
treachery?</said></p>
<p>The officer he addressed glanced at the boats
and returned no answer. Meanwhile a vast
multitude of natives had gathered in order to
see the English depart, and the embarkation
began, but it progressed with the utmost diffi-
culty. The officers and men standing in the
<pb n="270"/>
water helped the wounded and the ladies and
children into the boats, and even some of the
more friendly disposed natives came down and
assisted.</p>
<p><said>It is a thousand pities the boats are not in
deeper water!</said> exclaimed Captain Moore.
<said>Yet I cannot think they have been placed here
purposely. Look at that trooper. Would he
stand here if there was treachery?</said></p>
<p>This trooper was a Government camel <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">sowar</foreign>
from Agra, who had brought and safely de-
livered a dispatch from that station for General
Wheeler the previous evening. The man was
talking to the elephant driver who had brought
Lady Wheeler, and both seemed perfectly un-
concerned.</p>
<p>The ill-luck of the garrison continued. While
they were in the entrenchments they dreaded
the approach of the rains, as the wall would
have been washed away. Now they had to
mourn the absence of rain, for the Ganges was
at its lowest.</p>
<p><said>Hurry! hurry!</said> called out Captain Moore.
<said>It's no use preserving order. Get in how you
can. For Heaven's sake, push off quickly, and
get to the other side. I will then give you further
instructions.</said></p>
<p>The scene was one of terrible confusion. Dick
Heron searched everywhere for Ruth, but in
vain. He had once caught sight of her during
the painful journey to the river, but he had been
ordered with others to form a little rearguard
in case of treachery, and speech between them
was impossible. At the banks he hoped to ex-
<pb n="271"/>
change a word. A <q>God bless you</q> from her
dear lips would give him inexpressible comfort.
The boat under the charge of Major Vibart was
the first one to fill, but among the sad, hollow-
eyed, haggard-faced women, whom Dick was
assisting into the frail craft, he could not see
Ruth.</p>
<p><said>Enough,</said> shouted Vibart; <said>the boat won't
take any more.</said></p>
<p>It was deep in the water; its human freight
threatening a new danger owing to the lowness
of the river. Dick turned to prevent those
behind from crowding in and adding to the
risk, and came face to face with the girl for
whom he yearned.</p>
<p><said>At last!</said> he whispered eagerly. <said>I wanted
to see you once more. You must go in the next
boat. Major Vibart's is full.</said></p>
<p>She could say nothing. The ghost of a sad
smile flitted across her wan face. She was very
weak, and she let him take her in his arms and
carry her to the second boat.</p>
<p><said>You are coming too,</said> Dick heard her
murmur.</p>
<p><said>Not yet. I want to help the others.</said></p>
<p><said>No, no . . . you <emph>must</emph> come.</said></p>
<p>He was standing knee deep in the water
close to the edge of the boat. He suddenly
felt her arms round him. For an instant
both forgot everything but themselves. Their
lips were pressed in one long, fervent, fare-
well kiss.</p>
<p><said>God bless you, dear—dear Dick,</said> he heard
her breathe faintly.</p>
<pb n="272"/>
<p>The fulfilment of his wish! He did not care
now if death came. And indeed it was nearer
than he imagined.</p>
<p>While their arms were entwined a flag was
seen to wave from behind a group of natives on
the bank, and the rowers in Vibart's boat jumped
out and waded to the shore.</p>
<p><said>You rascals!</said> shouted the Major.</p>
<p>He whipped out his revolver and promptly
fired into the crowd of traitors, and two or three
of the soldiers in the boat followed suit. <said>Those
who are able, jump in the water and push the
boat off!</said> cried Vibart, and instantly all who
were not severely wounded sprang over the
side. Dick heard the Major's appeal, and
gently disengaged himself from Ruth's loving
embrace.</p>
<p><said>Good-bye, darling, my own love!</said> he cried
passionately. He rushed away waving some-
thing above his head. It was the handkerchief
she had given—his mascotte!</p>
<p>A sob escaped Ruth's lips, but Dick never
heard it. Happiness irradiated his wasted face,
and he rushed to the boat in front and lent his
strength to those already at work.</p>
<p>Scarcely had they moved the boat a foot
when a bugle note awoke the echoes, and
at the signal a deadly fire was opened upon
the defenceless people from an ambush all
along the banks. Among those who fell first
was brave Dick Heron. God was merciful to
him. Shot through the heart, he died a pain-
less death.</p>
<p>The musketry firing was commenced by some
<pb n="273"/>
troopers, and was taken up by the infantry con-
cealed in the ruined buildings near the river, on
the heights, and behind stacks of timber. Then
succeeded the roar of cannon.</p>
<p>Amidst this frightful scene and hideous din,
the proverbial coolness and intrepidity of Eng-
lishmen did not fail them. The fire of their
foes was at once returned from the fourth boat
on the line, and every exertion made to get
clear; but most of the boats were unable to
move. They simply became easy targets for the
cowardly demons, most of whom kept them-
selves concealed.</p>
<p>The diabolical scheme of Azimoolah was com-
plete indeed!</p>
<p>Unmindful of the Nana's oath and promise, a
conference had been held in the Nana's tent
between Azimoolah, the Nana's brother, and
others, and the wretches decided that the British
should be massacred on the banks of the river.
Orders were issued accordingly for the destruction
of the doomed garrisons.</p>
<p>At an early hour in the morning some five
hundred mutineers, with two guns, marched to
the Suttee Choura Ghaut, off which the boats
were moored. One gun and a party of sepoys
were placed in the ruins of a house which, being
built on a height, commanded the whole line of
boats.</p>
<p>Another party of twenty-five men were
secreted in a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">nullah</foreign>, or ditch. A third party
was drawn up behind some stacks of timber, and
lower down the river a number of troopers under
the command of Tantia Topee, who subsequently
<pb n="274"/>
led the rebels in the field against Havelock, were
posted. Still lower down was a second gun and
a large band of sepoys, and eight hundred yards
below this was a third gun, with its attendant
party. Two of the guns commanded the river
for some distance, both above and below the
little flotilla, and could easily rake the boats as
they lay at the Suttee Ghaut, as also any that
might succeed in getting away and floating down
the stream.</p>
<p>But this was not all. The infernal mind of
Azimoolah left nothing unthought of. On the
Oudh, or north side of the river (Cawnpore lies
on the south of the Ganges) the 17th Native In-
fantry, the 13th Native Cavalry, and two guns
were concealed behind a sandy ridge, the former
to intercept any fugitives attempting to escape
towards Lucknow, and the latter to fire upon
any of the unhappy victims seeking shelter on
the outer or river side of the boats. A party
of horse and foot were also told off to follow the
garrison, and on their reaching the wooden bridge
already mentioned as leading to the Suttee
Choura Ghaut, to form up there in line as a
firing party.</p>
<p>Thus every avenue of escape was guarded with
fiendish acuteness, and the doomed band com-
pletely hemmed in by their bloodthirsty and
cowardly foes.</p>
<p>It is not possible to describe the terror of the
poor women when the fierce, murderous fire
opened upon them on all sides. The brave, the
heroic Moore, the dauntless Lieutenant Ashe,
Lieutenant Bolton, who had entered the en-
<pb n="275"/>
trenchment by leaping his horse over the mud
wall after escaping a hundred deaths, were all
killed in attempting to push off Major Vibart's
boat. One lady was standing up in the stern
soon after the boat was floated, and having been
struck by a round shot, fell overboard and sank
immediately. Her poor little boy, six years old,
came up to Captain Mowbray Thomson with
tears in his eyes, and said:</p>
<p><said>Mamma has fallen overboard!</said></p>
<p>Captain Thomson endeavoured to comfort
him, but the poor little fellow cried out:</p>
<p><said>Oh, why are they firing upon us? Did they
not promise to leave off?</said></p>
<p>The horrors of the lingering hours of that day
seemed as if they would never cease. There was
no food on the boats, and scarcely one of the
fugitives had eaten before starting. The water
of the Ganges was all that passed the lips of
that devoted band, save prayers and shrieks
and groans. The wounded and the dead were
often entangled together at the bottom of the
boat.</p>
<p>And yet another horror was at hand. On
board Major Vibart's boat it fell to Ruth's lot
to be the first to discover it.</p>
<p><said>Captain Lawrence! Captain Lawrence!</said>
she cried in agonised tones, <said>the roof is burn-
ing!</said></p>
<p>It was too true. Before jumping overboard
the miscreants of boatmen had contrived to con-
ceal burning charcoal in the thatch. The straw
was like tinder; the motion of the boat, slow as
it was, had disturbed the hot air sufficiently to
<pb n="276"/>
fan the smouldering thatch into a flame. In a
few minutes the fire was crackling fiercely,
and thick clouds of suffocating smoke were
blinding the poor creatures. Some tried to
hurl the burning roof into the river, but the
thatch had purposely been made exceedingly
thick, and the disturbance only increased the
flames.</p>
<p><said>Jump into the river!</said> shouted Lawrence,
who was in command, in a despairing voice.
<said>It is our only chance. We can but die.</said></p>
<p>But, alas! the wounded could not stir. Their
cries were agonising, but they were beyond the
reach of human aid. Unable to move, they
were burnt to death. Mercifully, the volumes
of smoke veiled the terrible scene.</p>
<p>Those who had leaped into the water sought
shelter from the fierce storm of grape and
musketry on the outer or river side of the boats.
It was a vain hope. The fiends who had planned.
the hideous massacre were prepared for this.
Guns and infantry were posted on the Oudh side
of the river for this contingency, and they
opened a murderous fire.</p>
<p>Ruth was among those who were the last to
seek refuge in the river. She was a splendid
swimmer, and she went half a dozen yards under
the water before she came to the surface. So
long as she had life she would cling to it,
and after taking breath, she once more dived,
hoping to reach the bank, which, she thought,
would afford her a little shelter. She reached
the spot she had marked out, and here she
crouched.</p>
<pb n="277"/>
<p>Meanwhile, when the Nana's treachery be-
came apparent, the boat which General Wheeler
was about to enter with his family, cut its
cable and dropped down the river, followed
by two companies of infantry and two guns.
The brave old man stood for a moment gazing
at the scene of carnage, and while remaining
helpless and defenceless, one of the troopers
rushed at him and made a cut at him with his
sword. His head was severed and fell with the
body into the river.</p>
<p>Major Vibart's boat was a little lighter draught
than the rest, and got away first, drifting down
the stream. Those who had hurled themselves
in the water rather than be burnt alive swam
after it, but it dared not stop, and but for its
grounding the swimmers would never have
reached it.</p>
<p>The nearest party of sepoys immediately
opened fire with their muskets, and attempted
to commence a cannonade. They had two guns,
but the larger of these they did not know how to
manage, as they could not work the elevating
screw, so they loaded the smaller one with grape
tied up in bags, and the infantry discharged
their muskets. Yet even in that supreme hour
the heroic men, worn and defenceless, never lost
their courage. They responded with their rifles
so effectively that they actually drove off the
sepoys.</p>
<p>The boat was terribly crowded, for one of the
other boats which got away from the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">ghaut</foreign> was
struck by a round shot below the watermark,
and was rapidly filling when she came alongside
<pb n="278"/>
Major Vibart's boat. Many were drowned, but
the survivors were taken on board, leaving but
little room to work her.</p>
<p>She was soon, indeed, in a pitiable state. Her
rudder was shot away, there were no oars, and
the only implements which could be brought
into use were a spar or two and such pieces of
wood as could be safely torn from her sides.
Grape and round shot flew about from both
banks of the river, and shells burst constantly.
But about midday she got out of range of the
big guns, and these could no longer be shifted,
for the sandy bed of the river bank had disabled
the artillery bullocks; but the sepoys were on
the pursuit the whole day, firing volleys of
musketry incessantly.</p>
<p>Six miles was all that was accomplished
during the entire day. At 5 <abbr>p.m.</abbr> the boat
stranded, and the united efforts of those on board
to move her were useless. There was nothing
for it but to wait. The sepoys, they knew,
were far too cowardly to venture near. But
in the morning the enemy would be reinforced,
and then the end would come. Everybody in
the doomed craft was fully prepared to face
death.</p>
<p>The sun had gone down red and angry. The
air was insufferably close. The atmosphere
above the river was like a vapour bath; a mist
hung over the face of the waters. Distant
musketry fire could be heard at intervals, with
here and there a dropping shot. Their pursuers
had fallen away. Whither? Who could say?
Possibly to take part in the butchery which it
<pb n="279"/>
was certain awaited those whose boats had not
succeeded in getting away.</p>
<p>Just as night was falling the man who was on
the look-out called to Major Vibart:</p>
<p><said>Look there, sir. What is that? Shall I
fire?</said></p>
<p>A shadowy figure was crawling along the strip
of sand between the water and the bank. So
slowly did it move, one could hardly say there
was any motion at all.</p>
<p><said>Shall I fire, sir?</said> repeated the man.</p>
<p><said>Not yet. It may be one of our own party.
Great Heaven, it is a woman!</said></p>
<p>He sprang out of the boat, and so did another
officer who heard his words. They ran to the
dim outline—it was scarcely more. The last
ounce of strength was expended, the figure was
prostrate. They raised her. A faint sound
escaped her pallid lips, so faint it could scarcely
be called a groan.</p>
<p><said>Do you see who it is?</said> said Vibart in a
compassionate tone. <said>Poor Ruth Armitage,
the pluckiest little woman in the entrenchment,
and that is saying a good deal where all were
plucky.</said></p>
<p><said>Poor thing! I fear it is all over,</said> said the
other.</p>
<p><said>It would be cruel to wish otherwise,</said> said
Vibart in a low voice. <said>I'm heartily sick of it.
I care not how soon my hour comes.</said></p>
<p>How many times during that terrible three
weeks had not that wish been uttered!</p>
<p>They took her to the boat and laid her down.
She seemed to be scarcely conscious, and they
<pb n="280"/>
imagined her brain had been wandering. It
would not have been extraordinary, for she had
undergone a terrible ordeal. Hidden among the
tall weeds, she had undergone a thousand risks
of being shot, yet not one bullet had touched
her. She saw Major Vibart's boat go by, but
dared not come from her hiding-place.</p>
<p>She was sufficiently near the landing-place to
know what had happened—how all those who
were not shot, or burnt, or drowned, were hurried
by the brutal soldiery to land. Then some
cause, she knew not what, seemed to draw the
sepoys, the gunners, and the troopers from their
posts. However, it was clear to her that the
river was left unguarded, and she moved from
her hiding-place and swam down with the
current. Her weakness prevented her going
very far, and every now and then she had to
creep to the bank and rest, always choosing a
spot where she could conceal herself.</p>
<p>It was a miracle she reached the boat. But
for the fact that it was grounded she would
never have succeeded, and must have died of ex-
haustion. As it was, nothing could be done to
restore her strength, for there was neither bite
nor sup. And so she remained quietly lying like
a poor bruised lily, her life apparently ebbing
away.</p>
<p>All through the night incessant efforts were
made to get the boat afloat, and at last the
fugitives were successful. But they were not let
alone by the rebels. The latter took to shooting
arrows with live coal fastened to them, to
ignite, if possible, the thatched roof, and this
<pb n="281"/>
fiendish device might have been successful, had
not the officers and soldiers pulled the roofing
to pieces and thrown it overboard.</p>
<p>Thus, when the boat again started it was
without any protection from the scorching sun
and the bullets of the sepoys.</p>

<head type="main">The Last Stand</head>

<p>When morning broke not a sign of pursuit was
to be seen, and the poor souls began to indulge
in hopes that their merciless enemies had given
up the chase. Yet the boat was but a short
distance from Cawnpore; for, owing to the
absence of proper oars, they had during the
whole of the night gone only four miles.</p>
<p>Ruth was lying in a semi-conscious state at
the bottom of the boat, with wet rags over her
forehead. She was still terribly exhausted, but
had revived a little with resting. If only food
could be procured, she might yet recover strength.</p>
<p><said>Our sole chance of getting something to eat
is from a friendly native,</said> said Major Vibart,
<said>but some of you fellows will have to forage.
I'm helpless,</said> said he, with a melancholy smile.</p>
<p>The gallant officer had been shot through both
arms, and indeed there was not one of the men
who had not been terribly wounded. Captain
Athill Turner had both his legs smashed; Lieu-
tenant Quin was shot through the arm, Captain
Seppings through the arm, Lieutenant Harrison
was shot dead. With so many disabled—for, of
course, the privates and <abbr>non-coms.</abbr> were in the
<pb n="283"/>
same condition—the boat went along at a snail's
pace, and even then it was only with the greatest
care she was prevented from grounding. About
eight <abbr>a.m.</abbr> one of the soldiers called out that he
could see some natives bathing a little distance
ahead.</p>
<p>Upon this Captain Thomson spoke to a native
drummer who was in the boat, and persuaded
him to go and talk with them, and induce them
to get some food. The drummer took with Mm
five rupees, and came back with the welcome
news that one of the bathers had promised to
obtain some food, and also, if possible, the help
of some native boatmen. The man left his
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">lotah</foreign>, or cooking-pot, as a guarantee of fidelity,
but never returned, and so the hope which had
been kindled died away.</p>
<p>This man also gave the drummer some un-
pleasant information. Orders, so he said, had
been sent to Nuzzuffghur, two miles farther, to
seize the boat, and that a powerful <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">zemindar</foreign>, or
farmer, on the Oudh side had undertaken to see
that not one of the occupants of the boat should
leave his territory.</p>
<p><said>It's all up!</said> exclaimed Captain Whiting
despairingly. <said>Pass me that bottle.</said></p>
<p><said>What are you going to do?</said> said a brother
officer. The bottle was an empty one, and for
the moment he thought Whiting had taken leave
of his senses.</p>
<p><said>I want to write our last dying speeches and
confessions,</said> said Whiting, with a gloomy at-
tempt at a jest.</p>
<p>Somebody had a scrap of lead pencil, and
<pb n="284"/>
somebody else had a scrap of paper, and Captain
Whiting wrote a brief statement of the position
of affairs, and how all hope had been abandoned.
Then he added as many names of those who
were alive as he could cram into the paper: the
bottle was closed up and cast into the river,
there to take its chance. What became of it was
never known.</p>
<p>Half an hour afterwards some fellows appeared
on the bank dragging a small gun. Just as it
was pointed the rain poured down in torrents.
It was fired only once, and then the men went
away. There was no further molestation until
sunset, when a hideous shouting and yelling told
of the presence of pursuers. About fifty or
sixty sepoys were in a boat, which was being
rowed by a dozen native rowers. They had
come from Cawnpore with orders to destroy the
fugitives. So exultant were they at the pros-
pect of murder, that they stood up in the boat,
loading the English with abuse, and the rowers,
turning round to look at the boat in advance,
ran their own craft on to a sandbank. There
it stuck.</p>
<p><said>Boys,</said> cried Vibart, <said>we'll die fighting.
Let us go for them.</said></p>
<p>In spite of their exhaustion, all the gallant
fellows who could move jumped overboard, and
rushing through the shallow water, threw them-
selves on the grounded boat. In spite of their
superiority in numbers and in strength, the sepoys
made but a feeble resistance, and when the
victorious little band returned, each had killed
his man, and more. There was a quantity of
<pb n="285"/>
ammunition in the boat, and this Vibart appro-
priated. But, alas! there was no food, and
when the poor women asked eagerly if anything
to eat had been found, they could only be
answered by a mournful shake of the head.</p>
<p>That evening was a terrible one. Again was
the boat fast set on a sandbank, and it seemed
as if, indeed, the end of their journey had come.
Overcome with faintness and weariness, the poor
creatures sank down and allowed slumber to
seize them, wishing they might never wake
again. They were so indifferent and despondent
that they did not even post sentries. About
midnight came on a terrific hurricane, and
two or three of the lightest sleepers were
aroused.</p>
<p><said>God be thanked!</said> exclaimed one, <said>we're
rocking! We must be afloat again.</said></p>
<p>And so indeed it proved. But though hopes
began to rise, they were dashed when daylight
broke.</p>
<p><said>Ill-luck pursues us to the bitter end!</said>
cried Vibart. <said>Do you see where we are,
Sinclair?</said></p>
<p><said>I do indeed,</said> replied the man addressed.
<said>We've drifted out of the navigable channel,
and I doubt if we shall ever get back. There,
did you hear that?</said></p>
<p>A significant grating sound at the bottom of
the boat told what had happened. The boat
was again stranded, and this time it was not only
immovable, but had no chance of being moved,
for it was in a small tributary of the Ganges,
where the water was low and the current slug-
<pb n="286"/>
gish. Men and women looked at each other in
mute despair. What could they do but wait
for death?</p>
<p><said>And death will come quickly enough,</said>
muttered Vibart savagely between his teeth. <said>I
can see a party of the devils over yonder. It
won't be long before we are discovered.</said></p>
<p>He was quite right. With a fierce yell of
triumph a score of sepoys, the advance-guard
of others, opened fire upon the unprotected boat
remaining on the bank, a fixed, immovable
target which could not well be missed. But to
sit quietly and be shot at is not the way with
Britons.</p>
<p><said>Thomson,</said> exclaimed Major Vibart, <said>take
Delafosse, Sergeant Grady, and as many as you
can get together, and do your best to drive off
the scoundrels. It's our only chance. We
smashed up the others, and we may do the same
with these. While you're gone we'll try and
get the boat afloat.</said></p>
<p>Every one seemed to realise that now the last
moment had really come. Some of the women
shed tears silently; others, with dry eyes, sat
staring, vaguely, into space, their faculties
dazed and paralysed. In spite of the absence of
food, Ruth had gained a little strength. As for
her courage it was indomitable.</p>
<p><said>Can we not help you, Major Vibart?</said> she
asked.</p>
<p><said>What can you do? We can hardly help
ourselves, my dear,</said> said the Major bluntly.</p>
<p>Thomson and Delafosse had gone off on their
plucky expedition, and Vibart and a dozen or so
<pb n="287"/>
more were in the water nearly up to their waists
preparing for an effort to move the boat.</p>
<p><said>If we cannot fight, we can use our arms in
other ways. Let us,</said> she went on, turning
towards the women, <said>get out of the boat and
assist Major Vibart.</said></p>
<p>There was something inspiring in Ruth's
voice. It seemed to breathe of steadfastness
and hope. It roused the others, and, encour-
aged by her example, they jumped into the
water, and added their efforts, feeble as they
were, to those of the men.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Captain Thomson and his com-
rades, maddened by desperation, charged the
crowd of sepoys and drove them back some
distance, until they were thoroughly surrounded
by a mingled party of natives, armed and un-
armed. Cutting and slashing, they forced their
way through their foes, received more wounds,
but without the loss of a man. The sepoys fled,
and the brave fellows turned their faces once
more to the boat. Again they were surrounded,
and again they fought their way through to the
spot where they had landed, only to find the
boat gone.</p>
<p>At first they thought it had been moved, and
was farther down the stream, and so they ran
by the side of the river some little way. But
there was no sign of any boat or any indication
of any conflict, and there was nothing left but
to do the best they could for themselves. So
they turned from the river, and never did they
set eyes on the boat or its occupants again.</p>
<p>What had happened was this: Captain Mow-
<pb n="288"/>
bray Thomson and his men had not been gone
more than ten minutes before a couple of boats
were seen coming up from the Ganges into the
side-stream, where they were stranded.</p>
<p><said>Into the boat, all of you!</said> called out Vibart.</p>
<p>The poor creatures scrambled back just as a
fierce musketry fire was opened. Vibart was
killed on the spot, and half a dozen others
mortally wounded. One or two tried to fire
their muskets, but the torrents of rain had
ruined their ammunition. Resistance was use-
less. The sepoys saw this, and came on with a
rush. Surrounded as the little band was, and
half dead with fatigue, there was nothing left
but surrender. Then the firing ceased. The
prisoners were transferred to two other boats,
and the one they left was broken up. The
pieces floated down the stream into the Ganges,
and this is why when Mowbray Thomson re-
turned he could see no sign of the boat.</p>
<p>The fugitives received no ill-usage from their
captors, but this was because the latter were
anxious to make a good show before the Nana,
to whom the poor prisoners were to be delivered,
and about a mile from Cawnpore they were
landed and placed in carts. It was then July 3.
When they arrived at Cawnpore the men were
separated from the women, and ordered to be
shot. Among the doomed men was Captain
Seppings, of the 2nd Cavalry, and a few of his
troopers begged as a special favour that his life
might be spared.</p>
<p><said>No, no,</said> said the others; <said>he must be
killed.</said></p>
<pb n="289"/>
<p>They were Mahomedans who said this, and
as they uttered these words a crowd collected
round Captain Seppings and commenced repeat-
ing a Persian verse, the meaning of which was:</p>
<p><q>To extinguish the fire and leave the spark,
to kill a snake and preserve its young, is not the
wisdom of men of sense.</q></p>
<p>It was the custom of the Mahomedans when
a request was made to spare a male child—and
many of the natives were desirous of getting
some European child to adopt—to gather round
and chant in a monotone the verse of which the
above is a translation. Sometimes they carried
their beliefs further. It often happened when-
ever a Mahomedan found the <emph>lifeless</emph> body of
a European or Christian lying anywhere, he
immediately drew out his sword with a <q>bis-
millah,</q> and made a gash in the corpse. This
act was considered by them to be equivalent to
killing an infidel, and added to their claim for
entering Paradise after death.</p>
<p>Not one man received mercy that day. The
victims knelt down in prayer—the last prayer
their mouths would ever utter—and a volley of
musketry opened upon them. Several were
killed at once; those who were not dead were
dispatched by the sword.</p>
<p>The poor women sat awaiting their fate, but
their time had not yet come. They were ordered
to march in the direction taken by their guard,
and first their destination was the Servada
House, near the place of the massacre. After-
wards they were taken to a small, flat-roofed
house, whither the miserable women who had been
<pb n="290"/>
excepted from the massacre of the boats on
June 27 had preceded them. The meeting was
a terribly sad one. The poor creatures com-
pared notes, and sad indeed were their stories.</p>
<p>When Ruth saw the wretched hole into which
her companions were thrust she shrank back
appalled. It was simply an outbuilding divided
by a small compound from the bungalow to
which it belonged. This outbuilding stands out
in the history of the Mutiny as does no other
place. It cannot be thought of without a
shudder.</p>
<p>It comprised two principal rooms, each about
twenty feet long, and ten broad, with four dark
closets, rather than rooms, at the corners. These
four little prisons were but ten feet long by
eight feet wide. They were all very low
pitched; the roof was flat, and the doors and
windows were all secured by strong wooden bars.</p>
<p>Attached to this building was a brick well,
about the distance of forty or fifty feet towards
the east, around which grew a number of large,
shady trees. Mercifully, the poor creatures did
not suspect the use to which this well was
afterwards put.</p>
<p>Here in this suffocating place, without even
the relief of a punkah, the women were cooped
up, and after they had been imprisoned some
hours the door opened, and they saw standing
on the threshold a native woman, whose eyes
were glaring maliciously into the darkness of the
interior.</p>

<head type="main">The Fiendish Woman</head>

<p>There were some among the poor prisoners who
knew this woman with the hard, glittering eyes
and the hair streaked with grey.</p>
<p><q>The begum—Hooseinee Khanum,</q> they
whispered.</p>
<p>The woman's glance went rapidly over the
faces of the huddled crowd.</p>
<p><said>Where is the <foreign xml:lang="hi">baba logue</foreign> (girl of the master
race), Ruth Armitage?</said> said she.</p>
<p>Ruth heard the question. The sight of one
of her own sex among the enemies gave her
courage. Surely woman would be merciful to
woman. She boldly showed herself.</p>
<p><said>Ruth Armitage is my name. What is it you
want?</said></p>
<p>Hooseinee Khanum made no reply, but stared
at her insolently for some little time.</p>
<p><said>You are lucky, <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">baba logue</foreign>,</said> at last she said
in sneering tones.</p>
<p><said>What do you mean?</said> cried Ruth, her
heart failing, for the glance the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">begum</foreign> bestowed
upon her was anything but friendly.</p>
<p><said>You will see.</said></p>
<p>And without another word she glided away,
<pb n="292"/>
and was seen no more for some days. When
she next appeared it was to order every woman
to come out into the enclosure. Though this
order might be the prelude to some dreadful
deed the poor creatures gladly obeyed. It was
a boon to breathe pure air and see the bright
sunshine. Adjoining the compound which sur-
rounded their prison was a house called the Old
Cawnpore Hotel, and seats were placed for the
captives opposite the hotel, and here they were
told to sit down. They obeyed, wondering what
this act of politeness meant.</p>
<p>The veranda of the hotel was empty, but soon
after they had seated themselves, a stout, un-
gainly man with a vacuous expression on his
round fat face waddled from the door leading
into the house. He was richly dressed, and was
accompanied by a bearded man with keen,
piercing eyes. Ruth trembled when she saw
these men, for the first was Nana Sahib, and
the second Azimoolah Khan.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. The two simply sat and
stared, now and then exchanging a word. There
were many ladies among the prisoners to whom
both men three short months before had paid
obeisance, and despite the changes which priva-
tion and pain and misery had effected, these
ladies must have been recognised, but their
captors made no sign.</p>
<p>This ordeal was the precursor of others, and
for several evenings the prisoners were allowed
to promenade outside the building, and the Nana
and his brothers sat and glared at them from
the veranda of the hotel. All were surprised
<pb n="293"/>
when he ordered a little milk to be given to the
children; and on one occasion meat, cooked by
men hired for the purpose, was sent in. But
this concession was not repeated, and their
meals generally consisted of a small quantity of
dhal and chupatties. Clean clothes were also
issued, and for this boon the captive women
were deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Every day after the first <soCalled>parade,</soCalled> Hooseinee
Khanum visited the compound and spoke to
one, and then to another, insinuating that it
all depended upon themselves whether their lives
would be spared.</p>
<p>One morning, after the poor creatures had been
shut up about a fortnight, she came in and went
from group to group, scanning them with her
bright, serpent-like eyes. At last she stopped
in front of Ruth.</p>
<p><said><foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">Baba logue</foreign>,</said> said she, <said>why do you stay
here when you might be free and live in a beau-
tiful house, and have lovely jewels, diamonds,
and rubies?</said></p>
<p><said>What do you mean?</said> said Ruth.</p>
<p>The woman laughed.</p>
<p><said>Do you not understand? You are fair in
the eyes of Azimoolah Khan. Away from this
place, and with servants to dress your hair and
to wait upon you hand and foot, you would be
more handsome than you are now. Azimoolah
would save your life. You have but to say
<q>Yes.</q></said></p>
<p>Ruth's eyes flashed, and her pale cheeks
reddened with indignation.</p>
<p><said>Tell Azimoolah Khan that I've always
<pb n="294"/>
despised him, and that I despise him more than
ever!</said> she cried.</p>
<p><said>You are a fool!</said> answered the woman com-
posedly. <said>Do you not know that the English
will be killed—yes, all of them? The Nana's
soldiers are now on their way to meet the English
troops. Not one will escape. Ah, you are
brave, you English women, but you are foolish,</said>
said Hooseinee Khanum, with a sneer, and
walked away.</p>
<p>For the next three days permission was not
given for the captives to promenade as usual.
The heat of the flat-roofed house, crowded as it
was, became insufferable, and the poor things
endured intolerable torture. About noon on
July 15 they heard in the distance the clanging
of native instruments and the beating of drums
—the procession of the Nana at the head of his
men, who were going out to meet Havelock, for
news had arrived not only that the latter had
beaten the rebels twice, but that he was rapidly
advancing towards Cawnpore.</p>
<p>The tidings of the second defeat struck terror
into the camp at Cawnpore—the more so as
Bala Rao, the Nana's brother, had been severely
wounded in the shoulder. Every fresh intelli-
gence they received from the seat of war was
discouraging—every manœuvre proved futile.
The British were now within twenty miles of
Cawnpore, and there was no resisting them.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 15th a few troopers,
their horses covered with foam, galloped in.</p>
<p><said>The English,</said> they said to the Nana, <said>are
coming like mad horses and mad dogs. They
<pb n="295"/>
care neither for cannon nor musketry. It is the
women and children here that are making them
rush on. Kill the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">>maime!</foreign> (women). Kill the
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">baba logues!</foreign> (girls). Tell the English what
you have done and you will find they will be
discouraged, and go back, for they are but a
handful in number.</said></p>
<p>The Nana was not taken with this proposition,
but it was different with Azimoolah. For per-
sonal reasons he had a spite against the English
women, and he resolved to gratify it. So he
warmly approved the idea of the massacre, and
persuaded the Nana that the troopers were right
in believing the British force were advancing
simply for the sake of rescuing the women,
and that if these were killed the expedition
would be abandoned, as was really the case at
Jhansi.</p>
<p>A hurried conference was held by the Nana
and his friends, including a large number of
persons who by loans of money and otherwise,
had committed themselves to the rebel cause,
which they intended to desert. These persons
were well aware that ultimately the English
would gain the upper hand, and, thinking only
of their own safety, considered it would be well
if all chance of evidence of their connection with
the previous massacres were destroyed.</p>
<p>And so the bloody work was determined upon.
The Nana troubled himself no further, but with
all pomp and ceremony went out at the head of a
strong force to witness, as he expected, the total
rout of the British. Azimoolah Khan was left
behind to arrange the details of the butchery.</p>
<pb n="296"/>
<p>Within a few hours of the Nana's departure,
Hooseinee Khanum made her appearance.</p>
<p><said><foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">Mem-sahibs,</foreign></said> she cried in her guttural tones,
<said>you have but a few hours to live. The Nana
has ordered you to be killed.</said></p>
<p>A thrill of horror ran through the emaciated
frames of the poor victims. Huddled together
as they were, they crept yet closer, as though
for mutual protection. One woman among the
number refused to be terrorised. It was Ruth
Armitage.</p>
<p><said>I do not believe it!</said> she cried, in clear,
resolute tones. <said>You are lying, Hooseinee
Khanum. Yousouf Khan,</said> she continued, turn-
ing to the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">jemidar</foreign> of the guard, <said>you and your
men would not do such a wicked thing, I am
sure.</said></p>
<p><said>No,</said> said the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">jemidar</foreign>, <said>we will not hurt the
<foreign xml:lang="hi">maime</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="hi">baba logues.</foreign></said></p>
<p><said>Do you say that, Yousouf Khan?</said> said
the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">begum,</foreign> her lips parting with the fiendish
sneer which curled them. <said>We will see.</said></p>
<p>She said no more, but hastily left the bunga-
low, a low wail of terror from the poor doomed
women pursuing her.</p>
<p>No sooner had Hooseinee Khanum left than
the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">jemidar</foreign> followed her. He was not absent
more than five minutes, and when he came back
he went straight to where Ruth was standing
leaning against the wall, her face averted.</p>
<p><said>Missee,</said> said the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">jemidar,</foreign> <said>the Nana would
see you. If you went to him, you might do
some good.</said></p>
<p>Ruth wavered. It was the only chance. She
<pb n="297"/>
might induce him to be merciful. Who could
tell? She did not know that the Nana had
gone from Cawnpore, and had left the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">begum</foreign>
with supreme power.</p>
<p><said>Yes,</said> she replied, <said>I will go.</said></p>
<p><said>No, no!</said> cried half a dozen women im-
ploringly, <said>do not leave us. He means you
harm.</said></p>
<p><said>He cannot hurt me,</said> said Ruth in a low,
firm voice. <said>I can protect myself. Heaven
will give me courage. It is no sin to die by
one's own hand.</said></p>
<p>As she spoke she pressed the bosom of her
dress. Here she had concealed a small dagger.</p>
<p><said>Yousouf Khan, you were in my father's
regiment. He treated you kindly. For his sake
you would not deceive me.</said></p>
<p><said>I swear by Allah I will not.</said></p>
<p><said>Dear friends,</said> cried the poor girl, her large,
sympathetic eyes seeming to take in all the im-
ploring glances which were turned towards her,
<said>do not despair. There is yet hope.</said> And she
followed the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">jemidar</foreign>.</p>
<p>She did not return. Soon the poor anxious
souls within heard gruff voices outside mingled
with the shrill tones of Hooseinee Khanum.
The infamous woman was urging the soldiers to
enter the house and begin the work of slaughter.
The cavalry refused. Bloodthirsty as some had
shown themselves to be, they would not do
this. Neither would the infantry. Then the
woman ran back to Azimoolah Khan for instruc-
tions. A message was sent to the sepoy on guard
that if they refused they would be blown to
<pb n="298"/>
pieces by artillery. Upon this the soldiers re-
luctantly entered the house, fired once wildly at
the ceiling and rushed out.</p>
<p><said>We will have nothing to do with such
devilish work!</said> they cried.</p>
<p>Once more Hooseinee Khanum went away and
returned with five men, of whom two were butchers
and two were villagers. They were brutal,
bestial-looking creatures. One of the butchers
was a tall, stout, dark man, much pock-marked,
with a small beard; the fifth fellow was short
and stout, with great hairy hands.</p>
<p>A native drummer who was standing fifteen
paces off saw the murderers enter the house at
six o'clock. It was then sunset. He could see
the lady standing nearest the doorway cut
down; then the murderers disappeared inside.</p>
<milestone unit="tb"/>
<p>A man ran from the place of slaughter panting,
his eyes swollen, his face demoniacal. In one
big hairy hand he held a sword, its blade broken
in half. He went to the Cawnpore Hotel and
returned with another. Once more the same
man appeared. The second sword had broken.
He fetched a third.</p>
<p>Night closed in; the murderers came out.
The door was fastened after them. All was
over—save the horror, to come the next day—the
horror of the well. On that crowning scene of
the unspeakable tragedy let the curtain swiftly
fall.</p>

<head type="main">Too Late! Too Late!</head>

<p>Havelock—the man of the hour—arrived at
Benares on June 27, the day on which the
horror of the House of Massacre was perpetrated.
By the dawn of the 30th he and his men reached
Allahabad, and their eager eyes rested on the
fort towering above the majestic stream at its
base, the confluence of the Ganges, yellow-brown
and turbid, with the Jumna, clear, blue, and
sparkling.</p>
<p>Philip Heron had been introduced to the
General as a Balaclava man, and been heartily
received. Heron was strangely impressed by
the slender, well-knit figure, the grave, pale face,
the firm, resolute mouth, the earnest eyes sur-
mounted by strongly marked brows. The ab-
sence of beard and moustache brought into
prominence deep lines telling of a strong will,
and of habitual self-command.</p>
<p>A hearty cheer went up as the little force
passed through the Allahabad gate. The Madras
Fusiliers and the men of the 78th and 64th, who
had gone on first, Captain Maude's gunners, and
Brasyer's Sikhs, joined in one joyous outburst,
and Neill, tanned and worn, grasped Havelock
by the hand.</p>
<pb n="300"/>
<p><said>I've done my best, General,</said> Heron heard
him say. <said>You have arrived in time to wish
God-speed to Renaud. He sets out this after-
noon with an advance column for Cawnpore.</said></p>
<p>Philip could not catch Havelock's reply, but
he could see by the General's face it was con-
gratulatory. The news that an advance column
was about to start set Phil Heron on fire. Why
could he not be attached to this column?
Neill was then taking Havelock to his quarters,
where breakfast was awaiting them. There was
no time to be lost. Heron hurried after the two
leaders and made his request.</p>
<p><said>A day or two's rest would be better for you,</said>
said Havelock curtly.</p>
<p><said>I don't want any rest, sir,</said> he replied im-
pulsively. <said>Resting means wearing my heart
out. I shall never rest until I reach Cawnpore.</said></p>
<p><said>And maybe not then,</said> said Neill, with a
grim smile.</p>
<p><said>Why are you more impatient than the rest
of us to get to Cawnpore?</said> asked Havelock,
bending his keen eyes upon him.</p>
<p><said>My brother is there, and—and some one
else.</said></p>
<p>Phil Heron's voice must have betrayed his
feelings. Havelock paused, still with his eyes
resting on Captain Heron, and then said:</p>
<p><said>A woman?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, sir. The woman I love,</said> said Heron
frankly.</p>
<p>The General's face saddened. His eldest son
was with him on his staff, but his wife and the
rest of his children were in England. Probably
<pb n="301"/>
Phil's words had sent his mind flying home-
ward.</p>
<p><said>Your wife, sir?</said> he asked.</p>
<p><said>No, sir,</said> said Heron, imitating Havelock's
brevity.</p>
<p>The General made no reply—perhaps he under-
stood—but turning to Neill said:</p>
<p><said>What force are you sending with Renaud?</said></p>
<p><said>Four hundred Madras Fusiliers, and 84th,
three hundred Sikhs, a handful of troopers, and
a couple of nine-pounders.</said></p>
<p><said>Who is in command of the troopers?</said></p>
<p><said>Captain Harley.</said></p>
<p><said>Let Captain Heron accompany him. Renaud
will want all the horsemen he can get. What
about a mount?</said></p>
<p><said>I will manage that, sir,</said> Heron put in
boldly.</p>
<p>Havelock gave him a nod of approval. He
liked men who were anxious to help themselves.
Heron took the nod as setting a seal on his
instructions, and hastened away. In half an
hour he secured the horse, and rode to the canton-
ments, where the expeditionary force were
getting in readiness for departure. At four the
bugle sounded. Havelock gave the departing
force a few cheering words. Philip set his horse
to a canter, and the next minute was by the side
of Harley, who was riding at the head of his
company of Oudh cavalry.</p>
<p>The force could only travel at a slow pace.
The guns were drawn by bullocks, and these
leisurely animals sometimes lagged behind. It
was of the highest importance to keep in touch
<pb n="302"/>
with the artillery, and occasionally the head of
the column had to halt.</p>
<p>The sun sank, the western sky changed from
gold to purple, and finally its rosy glow melted
into grey. Night came on, but still the men
pushed steadily ahead. By midnight they had
been on the march some seven hours, and they
had covered scarcely more than twenty miles.
It was all-important to make use of the cool of
the night, and after a brief halt the bugle sounded
once more.</p>
<p>The men marched splendidly. They were as
eager as their leaders to get to Cawnpore, for
both the Madras Fusiliers and the 84th had
comrades shut up in Sir Hugh Wheeler's en-
trenchment. Captain Harley and Philip Heron
soon became chums. They discovered that they
had mutual friends in England, and this was a
pleasant link between them. They were trotting
a little ahead of the men, when Harley suddenly
exclaimed:</p>
<p><said>Hallo! What's that?</said></p>
<p>Something white was creeping along towards
them, keeping well within the deep shadow of
the long grass bordering the road on each side.
The moon was shining brightly, and though the
grass afforded splendid cover for sharpshooters,
the brilliant light enabled them to see the
slightest movement. Not a breath of air was
stirring, and the feathery tops hung motionless
in the heavy atmosphere. As they approached,
a man stepped boldly from the shadow. He
was in the ordinary native dress of Oudh, and
was armed with a bow and arrow.</p>
<pb n="303"/>
<p><said>I am your highness's humble servant,</said> said
the man with a low salaam. <said>I bring news from
Cawnpore.</said></p>
<p><said>Ah!</said> exclaimed Harley. <said>Are you sent
by Sir Hugh Wheeler?</said></p>
<p><said>No, sahib.</said></p>
<p>The man hesitated, and fumbled with his
waistband.</p>
<p><said>Then you bring a letter?</said></p>
<p><said>I bring no letter, sahib.</said></p>
<p><said>Then tell us your news,</said> broke in Philip
impatiently.</p>
<p>Heron could speak Hindustani, not fluently
perhaps, but sufficiently accurate for ordinary
conversation. Had the Crimean War not broken
out, he would have been sent to India. To that
end he had studied the language of the East at
Addiscombe. He had also worked at it all day
long during the voyage to Calcutta, and after
landing had never lost an opportunity of talking
to any of the natives he met.</p>
<p><said>My news is bad—is terrible,</said> said the man,
with downcast eyes. <said>Your lordships will not
believe me.</said></p>
<p><said>Why the deuce don't you speak?</said> rapped
out Harley.</p>
<p><said>The garrison has surrendered, sahib.</said></p>
<p><said>It's a lie. I know General Wheeler too
well!</said> cried Harley.</p>
<p><said>It is true. And it is not all the truth.</said></p>
<p><said>What then?</said></p>
<p><said>Massacre—murder.</said></p>
<p><said>My God!</said> exclaimed Heron. <said>The wo-
men—the children——</said></p>
<pb n="304"/>
<p><said>Massacred too, all but those <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">mem-sahibs</foreign> shut
up by Azimoolah Khan.</said></p>
<p>The two listeners looked at each other in silent
horror. An indescribable chill passed over Philip
Heron, as though every drop of blood in his body
had turned to ice. For a few moments the
appalling news stunned his brain, paralysed his
nerve, his very being. Harley was scarcely less
affected, but the terror did not come home per-
sonally to him as it did to Philip Heron.</p>
<p>The Hindoo in his simple language told how
the end had come. There was no prospect of
relief, and General Wheeler, moved by the suffer-
ing of the women and the rapidly diminishing
strength of the garrison, had surrendered, be-
lieving in the promise of Nana Sahib, that he
and the remnant of his brave troops, and the
women and children, should be allowed to go
safely to Allahabad. Then followed the treach-
ery of the Nana and his infamous adviser, Azi-
moolah. As the two men heard the ghastly
story of the boats they ground their teeth, and
clenched their fists till the nails were dug into
the flesh. Before the native had finished, Major
Renaud had joined the two men, and he was not
less moved than they.</p>
<p><said>Harley!</said> he exclaimed, <said>you must ride
instantly to Allahabad with this terrible news.
Heron will command the troopers meanwhile.</said></p>
<p>Harley would have much preferred to remain
with the advancing column, but it was of the
highest importance that Havelock should know
what had happened as soon as possible, and he
rode away.</p>
<pb n="305"/>
<p>The news from Cawnpore hastened the progress
of the force, and the men did not halt until the
morning was well advanced. The heat becom-
ing very intense, they rested for three or four
hours, and then pushed on by easy stages to
Lohanga. They were then forty miles from
Allahabad, and had thus come one-third of the
distance to Cawnpore. At Lohanga, about mid-
night, Harley rode in with dispatches from
Havelock. The instructions these dispatches
brought were disappointing, though possibly
wise. Renaud was ordered to stand fast at
Lohanga.</p>
<p>Harley reported that there had been a differ-
ence of opinion between Neill and Havelock on
the subject. Neill regarded the reports from
Cawnpore as a device of the enemy, and with
his usual energy and eagerness urged that
Renaud should push forward. Havelock thought
that in the event of the news being true, Renaud's
small force would simply meet with disaster if
it encountered the enemy, as most likely it
would, in overwhelming strength. Neill was so
sanguine that he was injudicious enough to
telegraph to Sir Patrick Grant, the Commander-
in-Chief, a remonstrance against the orders of
his superior officer, and the causeless delay he
considered they involved. And so it came
about that the little army remained at Lohanga
a couple of days, when further instructions came.</p>
<p>Sir Patrick Grant, it appeared, had replied to
Neill's telegram that if the disastrous news from
Cawnpore was credited, Renaud's force was to
be halted until supported by Havelock's.
<pb n="306"/>
Renaud was nevertheless directed to move for-
ward, and so he cautiously advanced to the
vicinity of Kazan, about twenty miles short of
Futtehpore, a little less than sixty miles distant
from Cawnpore. At Kazan they waited im-
patiently for the coming of Havelock. Never
had they felt so anxious, and all the rest were
equally so. At last Philip Heron burst out:</p>
<p><said>Major Renaud, this inaction is terrible. Let
me ride ahead and see if the road to Cawnpore
is open.</said></p>
<p>Renaud paused for a moment, and then gave
his consent, but somewhat unwillingly.</p>
<p><said>You had better take ten troopers with you,</said>
said he.</p>
<p><said>I'd rather go unattended,</said> returned Philip
shortly. <said>I've not too much faith in my men.</said></p>
<p><said>Very well,</said> said he, <said>do as you like, and
good luck go with you!</said></p>
<p>Phil Heron rode about ten miles without
meeting a single soul. Even the two villages he
passed through were deserted. The news of
Neill's hangings and floggings at Benares had
spread, and doubtless it was known that the
British force was about to advance from Allaha-
bad. The villagers, in their fear of reprisals for
the butchery at Cawnpore, had taken flight.</p>
<p>The road was terribly parched and dusty.
The rain was daily expected, but none had yet
fallen. The sound of the horse's hoofs plough-
ing deep in the soft sand, was scarcely audible.
On either side stretched vast, undulating plains,
and in front was a range of low hills, apparently
covered with short, scrubby trees. A trot of
<pb n="307"/>
half a mile brought Heron to the rising ground.
A few yards farther and he had entered the
gloom of the trees, which he found were taller
than he had at first imagined them to be.</p>
<p>Philip allowed his horse to go at a walking
pace, and the ground gradually rising, he arrived
at the crown of the bill, and there saw through
the openings between the trees what appeared,
in the uncertain light of the moon, to be a large
army encamped on the plain below. Beyond,
some five miles away, was the town of Futteh-
pore. Heron reined in his horse. To go farther
would be foolhardy, for he would simply come
out into the open, a conspicuous object easily to
be seen by the most careless of sentries.</p>
<p><said>Havelock was right,</said> he thought. <said>There
are three thousand men at least down there.
Renaud's four hundred, with only one hundred
British redcoats among the lot, would be eaten
up.</said></p>
<p>
Philip sat quietly estimating the extent and
nature of the force—he could see a battery of
artillery quite plainly through his field-glass—
and then decided to return. He had scarcely
wheeled round when the jangling of accoutre-
ments and the sound of mocking laughter burst
upon his ear. That mocking laughter did not
come from English throats. The voices be-
came louder. He could distinguish words. The
men were talking in ribald fashion of the mas-
sacre in the boats, of the poor captive British
ladies. The Englishman's blood boiled. He had
no thought of escape. The only sensation he was
conscious of was the desire to cut, slash—to kill.</p>
<pb n="308"/>
<p>Tramp, tramp, jingle, jingle, more coarse lan-
guage and offensive chuckles. At last they
appeared—half a dozen native cavalry, fully
armed. Seeing a British officer sitting there so
motionless, they were at first horribly frightened.
They reined up their steeds in a clatter and con-
fusion. Philip did not give them time to recover.
A flash, a report, and the foremost man fell head-
long from his saddle. The pistol shot seemed to
bring the others to their senses. It convinced
them he was not a spectre. They came on
helter-skelter. Again a barrel of his revolver
was emptied, but, unluckily, Heron's horse was
not well used to the sound of firearms. He
had probably missed his mark, for the men
kept their seats.</p>
<p>Heron had but time to fire a third shot—with
success, luckily—when they were upon him—
four <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">sowars</foreign>, with their swords flashing in the
moonlight. In a second Philip's blade was out.
He felt as though he could sweep it through the
bodies of the miscreants at a blow. But he
attempted nothing of the kind. Slashing was
all very well under certain circumstances, but
not now. It took too much time. He used the
thrust.</p>
<p>The first <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">sowar</foreign> made the mistake Heron
avoided. He raised his sword for a sweeping cut.
Before it had descended a quarter of the curve
necessary, the point of the Englishman's blade
pierced his windpipe. It was a lucky stroke.
Had Heron ran him through the body he might
not have been able to withdraw his sword in
time for the attack of the second man, who was
<pb n="309"/>
rushing upon him with a direct stab. As it was,
the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">sowar's</foreign> thrust was parried, and before he
could recover or guard, he was a dead man.</p>
<p>The victory was won, for the remaining two
did not stay to fight. They wheeled round and
galloped away their hardest. Heron galloped
too, in the opposite direction; he saw the pistol
shots had aroused the camp, and he was now
anxious to rejoin Renaud and tell him the news.</p>
<p>The moon was shining brightly when he
arrived about half a mile from the camp. Surely
he could hear the wild, warlike tones of the High-
land pipes! He reined in his horse, the better
to listen. His ear had not deceived him; and
mingled with the shrill note of the pipes came
the hearty, soul-stirring cheers of British soldiers.
There could be but one explanation. Havelock
with the Ross-shire Buffs and the 64th had
arrived.</p>
<p>Heron put his jaded steed to the gallop, was
soon at the camp, and was at once spotted by
his old comrade Macintyre, but had scarcely
time to say a word when he caught sight of
Havelock, and quickly reported to the General
the position of the enemy. Havelock's face
brightened.</p>
<p><said>I could wish they were nearer,</said> said he with
a smile.</p>
<p>Havelock had already been informed by means
of his spies that a body of mutineers from
Cawnpore was advancing—3,000 strong in regu-
lar sepoys, amply provided with artillery, and
swollen by hundreds of irregular cavalry. He
felt that Renaud's position was precarious; but
<pb n="310"/>
to order him to fall back would have been fatal,
so he determined to overtake him by a forced
march.</p>
<p>Fatigued as the men were, there was little time
for rest; and after a brief halt the night march
was resumed, Renaud's force in the place of
honour. At seven o'clock the following morning
the tired men reached the camping ground of
Belinda, four miles from Futtehpore. Here it
was that Philip Heron had seen the mutineers
drawn up, but not a vestige of them was now
visible, his encounter with the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">sowars</foreign> had no
doubt altered their plans.</p>
<p>The soldiers, half dead with fatigue, were not
sorry to rest and breakfast. The cooks of the
various messes were already active, and Have-
lock was sitting under a tree, when suddenly a
round shot came rolling along within half a
dozen yards of him. The only damage it did
was to smash one of the camp kettles of the
64th.</p>
<p>In an instant the whole camp was alive, and
the bugle was sounding the <soCalled>assembly.</soCalled> Colonel
Tytler, who had gone on a reconnaissance, was
then seen galloping back with his volunteer
cavalry, followed by a swarm of native horse-
men, who no sooner saw they were rushing upon
Havelock's full force than they wheeled round
and disappeared.</p>
<p>What happened next can be quickly told. The
Nana's army retreated to Futtehpore; the town
was taken at the bayonet's point; Colonel Maude's
artillery paralysed the sepoys, and the slaughter
was great. It was Havelock's first victory, to
<pb n="311"/>
be followed by the encounter at Aong, where the
gallant Renaud fought his last fight; the deadly
struggle at the half-broken bridge over the
Pandoo-Nuddee, and the terrific onslaught,
against a withering fire, of the village beyond,
where the Highlanders and the 64th, forgetting
their exhaustion, rivalled each other in the fury
of their attack.</p>
<p>The day seemingly was won, though at terrible
cost, when suddenly the force in advance came
upon the main body of the sepoy army, in the
middle of which, in a richly ornamented howdah,
on the back of an elephant, was Nana Sahib
himself!</p>
<p>Havelock was without his artillery, his men
were spent, but he did not waver. The scene
was one never to be forgotten. The General
wheeled round his pony—his horse had been
shot under him—and facing his men he cried in
the steady, sonorous voice which his soldiers
knew so well:</p>
<p><said>The longer you look at it now the less you
will like it. Rise up. The brigade will ad-
vance, left battalion leading.</said></p>
<p>The magic of Havelock's personality told. A
mad, irresistible rush, and the vast host of
mutineers losing heart gave way before the
avenging little army, whose courage nothing could
daunt. Then up came Maude with his guns, and
all was over.</p>
<p>Cawnpore was won!</p>
<p>A much-needed bivouac and the next morn-
ing Havelock entered the city. Not a sepoy was
to be seen. Where were the poor women and
<pb n="312"/>
children? Three men of the 78th, Macintyre
among them, with Heron, were the first to
search. Passing the entrance of a compound
near the Cawnpore Hotel some indefinable
feeling made them pause. It was as if a re-
straining hand had been laid upon them.</p>
<p>A native was hovering about the entrance,
horror written upon his dusky face. When the
four soldiers approached he seemed inclined to
fly. Indeed, he did run a few paces, but he, too,
was under the mysterious influence which had
affected the searchers. He came back, and with
a whispered <q>Sahib!</q> pointed within.</p>
<p>Inside the compound was a low, flat-roofed
bungalow. The Highlander in advance entered,
and almost immediately reappeared, his once
ruddy face ashen, his hands thrown up con-
vulsively, his whole frame in a tremor. He was
paralysed with horror. Vainly he strove to speak.
Not a sound came from his white lips.</p>
<p>The end of their quest had come. They had
reached the House of Massacre!</p>
</div>

<div n="24" type="chapter">
<pb n="313"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="24">XXIV</num></head>
<head type="main">Vengeance is Mine!</head>

<p>The discovery of that morning, the thoughts of
that horrible massacre and the awful well,
hovered over every one like a thick, impenetrable
mist. Then came the blankness, the reaction
after the excitement and deadly strain of the
past three days, and worse than all, the sickening
feeling that the labour, the suffering, the loss of
life, had been in vain!</p>
<p>Depression gave place to devilment. The men
broke bounds, and, finding quantities of spirits
in many of the houses, were for the time being
converted into raging demons. Here had come
in the fiendish cunning of Azimoolah Khan.
The wretch knew human nature well, and lie
was pretty certain what would happen when
our men entered the city, if he could put the
means in their way. So before leaving Cawnpore
he took care to plant in dozens of the deserted
houses stores of rum and other spirits, and
the soldiers swallowed the vile stuff without
ceasing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Philip Heron searched high and
low throughout Cawnpore. He had not the
shadow of a hope that either Dick or Ruth was
<pb n="314"/>
alive; but to be inactive was torture, and on,
on, he went, hour after hour.</p>
<p>Now and again he picked up scraps of the
pitiful story, and among other things, learned
of the Nana's palace at Bithoor. Attaching
himself to Barrow's horse, which towards evening
set out for Bithoor, Heron proceeded thither.</p>
<p>An hour's ride brought them within sight of
the building, and Heron rode ahead to recon-
noitre. So far as he could tell, no preparations
had been made for defence. On came the little
troop of horsemen, not knowing whether from
some hidden battery shot and grape would be
suddenly poured upon them. But all was silent.
Barrow and Heron entered the palace, and were
met by a native, who fell on his face before them.
This man was Narrain Rao, whose father had
been in the service of the old Bajee Rao, whose
adopted son was Nana Sahib.</p>
<p><said>Where's your villainous master?</said> de-
manded Heron, his revolver a couple of inches
from the trembling man's head.</p>
<p><said>Fled my lords, to Delhi or Lucknow. Your
servant does not know which. It is the truth he
is telling your lordships.</said></p>
<p>Leaving Barrow to deal with the man, Heron
stepped to one of the windows and saw that
earthworks had been thrown up near the house,
and guns mounted. <said>You had prepared us a
welcome, I see,</said> said he, pointing to the guns.</p>
<p><said>Ah, Sahib, I had to do that to satisfy the
Nana,</said> said the man through his chattering
teeth.</p>
<p>Whether this was the truth is difficult to say.
<pb n="315"/>
Certain it is that Narrain Rao was of great
assistance to General Neill when the latter
arrived at Cawnpore a few days later, and it
was said he was on bad terms with the Nana.
Probably he saw it was to his advantage to
remain in the palace, and pretend to be friendly
towards the British, for he took care to appro-
priate as many valuables as he could lay his
hands upon.</p>
<p>While Barrow was talking with Narrain Rao,
a tremendous shouting outside announced the
arrival of a detachment of Madras <soCalled>Lambs</soCalled> and
Sikhs. When it was discovered there was no
fighting to be done, the soldiers scattered them-
selves over the building to loot, riot, smash, and
finally to burn.</p>
<p>Barrow disappeared to restore order if possible,
but his endeavours were of little avail. The
men were raging through the luxurious rooms
like maniacs, the British soldiers, with their
muskets clubbed, smashing everything within
reach, and the Sikhs busily looting. Not a sepoy
or servant was to be seen. Narrain Rao had
vanished. Had he remained, he would have
received but short shrift.</p>
<p>His quest unsatisfied, Philip Heron hurried
from room to room. The interior of the palace
was like a maze, with its multitudinous apart-
ments, its bewildering corridors, passages, ante-
chambers and staircases, arranged without order
or convenience.</p>
<p>By this time the sunset was well-nigh over, and
the light was dim, yet Philip had not explored
all the rooms. He had found himself in an
<pb n="316"/>
apartment to which apparently there was but
one door. He was about to return to the
passage from which he had entered the room,
when amid the distant yells of the infuriated
soldiery he fancied he heard a voice quite near.
He listened breathlessly. The sound appeared
to come from a side of the room fitted with
panels, richly inlaid with sweet-scented w o s
of varied hues. He crept close and listened.
The words were in Hindustani, but their meaning
was plain to the listener.</p>
<p><said>You will never leave this place alive,</said> the
voice was saying—whether a man or woman was
speaking, Philip could not determine—<said>Your
countrymen have reached the Nana's palace.
They will not find the Nana, but they <emph>may</emph> find
you—dead! Do you understand?</said></p>
<p>There was no answer. The voice went on:</p>
<p><said>You could have been killed like the rest, but
I wanted to see you die. I hate you, because I
hated the young <foreign xml:lang="hi">hoozer</foreign> (English officer) who
loved you, and who scorned <emph>my</emph> love. Hooseinee
Khanum never forgets—never forgives. It was
I who fired at him when he was with you. I
would have had him drop dead at your feet.</said></p>
<p>Again there was a pause.</p>
<p><said>Azimoolah would have made you his slave,
but your beauty was gone. He cared no more
for you when your cheeks were white and wasted
and your eyes were dull. I begged <emph>you</emph>—the
<foreign xml:lang="hi">baba logue</foreign> from him. <said>Do what you like with
her,</said> he said. <said>I want to see her die,</said> I told
him. Azimoolah laughed.</said></p>
<p>Then the other—the victim, the rival spoke.</p>
<pb n="317"/>
<p><said>Why do you not kill me then? I don't want
to live. Kill me quickly. Oh! Dick, Dick,
why did I not die with you!</said></p>
<p>Philip Heron started. The lament was uttered
in English! The next moment he hurled himself
against the panelled wall. The woodwork was
but frail, and gave way with a crash and a
splintering.</p>
<p>The last rays of the setting sun shone full on
the lancet-shaped window, and suffused the room
with a crimson light. A girl was tied hand and
foot to a pillar in the centre supporting the
vaulted roof. At the end of the room near the
window crouched a woman, whose dusky face.,
with its repulsive, cruel lips, was distorted with
rage, hatred, and jealousy. She was feeling for
the catch of the window to escape from the
vengeance which she knew was pursuing her.</p>
<p>Heron wasted no time on the woman; he
dashed to the girl, and in a trice cut her bonds
with his sword. At the same moment the window
was thrown open and Hooseinee Khanum,
climbing upon the sill, was lowering herself to a
ledge beneath, along which she intended to
crawl. Then came a terrific explosion, a snake-
like tongue of flame darted past the window,
illuminating the room for a second, and was
followed by dense clouds of acrid, suffocating
smoke. There were heard yells, shouts of de-
risive triumph, mingled with cheers from a score
of British throats. The palace had been set on
fire!</p>
<p>Suddenly the cheers ceased as though cut by
a knife. Hooseinee Khanum, the Jezebel of the
<pb n="318"/>
House of Massacre—had fallen headlong from the
ledge on which she had taken refuge, and was
dashed upon the pavement below. The infamous
woman had met the fate of her prototype!</p>
<milestone unit="tb"/>
<p>Hooseinee Khanum's thirst for revenge had re-
coiled upon itself. But for this Ruth must have
shared the fate of the rest, and to find herself in
the arms of the man whom she secretly loved,
whom she had never forgotten, but whom she
had never thought to have seen again, was like
a glimpse of heaven. Hooseinee spoke with
jealous spite when she said Ruth's beauty was
gone. True, her cheeks were thin and wan, her
form wasted, but her eyes were more lustrous
than ever. They shone with the light of the
courage and endurance which had never failed
her throughout those never-to-be-forgotten
horrors.</p>
<p>The first shot fired into the entrenchment was
on June 6, the tragedy of the House of Massacre
was enacted on July 15—some five weeks only!
To Ruth these weeks were so many years of
intolerable torture. Strange would it have been
if such a frightful strain upon her vitality had
not left indelible traces behind.</p>
<p>The time came when all that Ruth had gone
through seemed vague, shadowy, unreal, for
memories of misery are fleeting; those of happi-
ness enduring. Only one link with terrible
Cawnpore remained unbroken—her remembrance
of poor Dick; and for her husband to know that
his brother had loved her, made her more precious
<pb n="319"/>
in his sight. Many a time in the peace and
quietude of their English home, when the prattle
of their children had ceased, and the house was
still, did they wander hand in hand in their
pretty garden by the river, while the sun went
down and the shadows lengthened, and talk in
low voices of Dick. Only those who have
suffered and have made sacrifices know the
nobility, the undying romance of pure love; and
though it would have sounded selfish to have
said in so many words that for them Dick had
not died in vain, yet both felt it was the truth.
Even death has its compensations.</p>
