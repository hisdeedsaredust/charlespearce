<p>It was absurd. So Squire Simon Halstead might have
confessed when he was cool—if he ever confessed any-
thing or was ever cool. He had fallen out with his step-
son, Jack Ralstone, and about nothing. Forty-nine
people out of fifty would at all events have said it was
nothing. But when Simon Halstead was contradicted
anything was good enough for a quarrel and he was
readier to quarrel with Jack than with anybody in the
world. Maybe Jack had lost his temper also. He
certainly had not been sufficiently respectful, but the
Halstead blood did not run in his veins and possibly the
fact inclined him to rebellion.</p>

<p><said>The impertinent jackanapes,</said> spluttered Simon, his
red face purpling under the effect of rage and rum, after
preparing the way for the rum with a good dinner and
a couple of bottles of port. <said>What the deuce does he
know about milling? But it isn't so much his standing
out against me as that he should go agen his own county
and his own city where he was born and where I was
born and my father afore me—good old Bristol city.</said></p>

<p>Undoubtedly this was the offence, but there were
other grievances with which Jack had nothing to do.
The Somerset justices, of which body Simon was one,
had decided to prohibit the prize fight between Bill
Neate of Bristol city and Tom Spring of London being
fought within the boundaries of the county. The
justices of Berkshire and Wiltshire had been similarly
un-English, and the sporting world, which in 1823
included all classes of society, from the noble Corinthian
<pb n="8"/>
to the coalheaver, was at its wits' ends to find a place
suitable for the Homeric fight.</p>

<p>When the Bristol J.P.'s took their unpatriotic step,
Simon told them plainly what he thought of their molly-
coddling spirit. Had Squire Halstead been a gentleman
in his manner and ideas more than one representative of
old Somersetshire families would have asked him to back
his opinion with duelling pistols.</p>

<p>But Simon was not a man to be treated as a gentle-
man. As a matter of fact he was very much the reverse
of one. His thick-set clumsy figure, his rolling gait,
acquired in early youth from his life aboard ship, his
full-bodied language, his love for rum and curaçao, a
taste which he brought with him from the West Indies,
were not prepossessing. Apart from this there were
ugly stories about life in Barbados on his sugar planta-
tions. Slavery, in spite of the efforts of Clarkson and
Wilberforce, was in full swing, and Simon it was said
was a hard taskmaster.</p>

<p>There were worse things than this attached to the
name of Halstead. His father and grandfather had
been Bristol shipowners, and it was whispered that
not contented with trading in <soCalled>black ivory</soCalled> from
Africa, to feed the plantations in the West Indies, they
did not object—at a price—to traffic in white men for
the same purpose. Bristol had an evil reputation in
the eighteenth century for exporting queer cargoes.
Simon did not often allude to his bygones, save when
in his cups. Sometimes on these occasions allusions
slipped from him which pointed to experiences not un-
like those of his forbears.</p>

<p>However this might be, there was not the slightest
doubt of three things—one was his enormous wealth,
another his prodigious meanness, when he was in the
humour, and thirdly, his pride in his stalwart stepson,
Jack Ralstone.</p>

<p>Jack was to make amends for the shortcomings of his
stepfather. Jack was to be a gentleman; Jack was
to marry a lady of title—this was an indispensable item
in Simon's programme—Jack was to enter Parliament;
he was to jump into a comfortable sinecure governmental
<pb n="9"/>
post and in due time he was to have a handle to his
name. The last was to be managed through the kindly
offices of the Duke of Endsleigh.</p>

<p>Jack had not been consulted about a single thing—not
even about the projected marriage between himself and
Lady Barbara Dacre, the daughter of the aforesaid
duke. Not that he cared much. He was quite con-
tent to do as he liked—when out of Simon's sight—and
spend his allowance to the uttermost farthing, and a
little beyond, as speedily as he could after receiving it
through the family lawyer.</p>

<p>The young man—he was twenty-two—had a great
capacity for enjoyment. Life had gone easily with him,
and as far as he could see would continue to do so.
The marriage with Lady Barbara did not trouble him.
Lady Barbara was a glorious specimen of Somersetshire
beauty in the full flush of womanhood. What more
could any reasonable man want?</p>

<p>But to-day fate had chosen to thrust its interfering
fingers into his life. He had quarrelled with his step-
father over a trifle. He was as conscious of the ab-
surdity of the whole thing as Simon Halstead ought to
have been. Perhaps it was not so much the quarrel
itself which ruffled him, as Simon's overbearing air of
authority, and rather than utter retorts, which would
have widened the breach, Jack had walked out of the
dining-room heedless of the <q>Come back, ye dog,</q> that
the Squire hurled at him.</p>

<p>With his hands in his pockets, a cigar—or <q>segar</q> as
the word was spelt in those days, the accent on the first
syllable—between his lips and a puckered brow, Jack
Ralstone strode into the soft spring air. It was the
beginning of April and the western wind brought with it
a pleasant tang from the rolling Atlantic. Jack stood
on the raised terrace fronting the entire length of the
rambling old house wondering how to amuse himself
and calm his perturbed spirits.</p>

<p>He was certainly a son of whom any father might be
proud. Six feet in his stockings, deep rather than broad
chested and with a mighty development of muscle about
his shoulders and back, thin flanked, and straight as an
<pb n="10"/>
arrow, he would not have discredited the gladiatorial
arena. He was much more powerful than one who had
never seen him stripped would have suspected. His
perfectly fitting coat—one of Stultz's masterpieces—
concealed the broadness of his back and the elaborate
cravat which swathed his throat to his chin did not
allow his brawny neck to be seen.</p>

<p>For the rest, his well-shaped head was surmounted by
a mass of curly hair, lightish brown with a dash of red;
his eyes blue, gleamed from beneath dark brows; the
mouth was firmly cut, and only his square prominent
chin betrayed the temperament of the born fighter,
while a certain look in the eyes told that if need be
they could flash with anger and harden with determina-
tion.</p>

<p>Had Jack in his early boyhood had much to do with
his stepfather, he might have imbibed some of Simon's
truculent bullying spirit. As it happened he was a
baby when Halstead set out to develop his West India
plantations and he was twenty when the old man
returned. Virtually Simon Halstead had deserted his
young wife, a widow with one son, when she married the
planter. Their short spell of marriage had been a
stormy one, and Simon went off in a hurry after making
provision for the lady. When she died he wrote his
instructions to his lawyers for Jack's education and
maybe thought no more of the lad until he returned to
his native Bristol to spend his last days as a Somerset-
shire squire, and found a handsome, high-spirited lad of
fourteen awaiting him. Jack Ralstone filled up a
vacancy in Simon Halstead's heart, of which the hard-
grained man had not been conscious until he returned
to England and found English life so different from that
in the West Indies.</p>

<p>Jack had just the looks and disposition the planter
delighted in. Bold, fearless, active, revelling in out-
door life and exercise, the boy promised to develop into
a splendid man physically, and animal strength was
what pleased Simon Halstead most. But he was not
blind to other qualities. Jack's father was of gentle
blood, and his runaway match with the companion of
<pb n="11"/>
old Lady Ralstone, his grandmother—a fashionable
beauty in her youth, and a confirmed gamester and
domestic tyrant in her old age—was nothing to his dis-
credit though it cost the fortune which the venerable
dame would otherwise have left him.</p>

<p>Of humble origin himself, Simon <q>dearly loved a
lord,</q> and he determined that Jack should he brought
up as a gentleman, and so cast the reflection of rank
upon himself. He consulted his lawyer, a man of the
world and as a result Jack was sent to Eton and in due
time to Oxford. His acquirements were neither more
nor less than those of the average undergraduate of the
period, and he probably spent more time on horses and
athletics than on the classics and mathematics. But he
spent money and he rubbed shoulders with aristocrats,
and Simon Halstead was satisfied.</p>

<p><said>I suppose the old man'll come round by the time
we meet again,</said> Jack was muttering as he paced the
terrace. <said>I'm not going to give in. Why the devil
should I? I've as much right to my opinion as he has
to his. Dashed odd nobody about here's of my way of
thinking. But they don't know—they don't know.
Besides I've backed Tom pretty deeply—it's as well that
I didn't tell <emph>this</emph> to the old man. If I lose——</said></p>

<p>The broad shoulders heaved, but with defiance, not
with apprehension. He was in the mood just then not
to care for anything and if the difference he had had
with his stepfather and the hot words they had ex-
changed deepened into something serious, well it must
be so.</p>

<p>He sauntered round to the stables, idly kicking the
pebbles as he went. He wanted to talk with some one
and he was glad to hear the ring of a horse's hoof on the
cobble stones and the hiss of old Stephen's breath, the
necessary accompaniment to <q>rubbing down.</q> He
entered the stable yard and the groom looked up
as the young man's shadow, cast by the lantern on
a hook in the wall, fell athwart the stones. Stephen
suspended operations and his finger went to his fore-
lock.</p>

<p><said>Coom to have a sight o' th' 'osses, Master Jack?
<pb n="12"/>
This 'ere one be a rattlin' good bit o' stuff. Me an' the
squire give a 'undred guineas for 'un at last Weyhill
fair an' he be worth every farden. Way &#x2026; ay theer!
The nag's a bit fresh—the squire doan't gi' 'im enough
work. I've told squire so but what be the use o'
taakin'? Squire doan't think anybody knows any-
thing but hisself, squire doan't—a beggin' your pardon,
zur.</said></p>

<p>The horse, a black hunter, tossed his head and lifted
his legs restlessly, with a great clatter.</p>

<p><said>By gad, you're right there, Steve,</said> laughed Jack.
<said>I had to tell him as much not a quarter of an hour
ago.</said></p>

<p><said>Noa, did 'ee?</said> said Stephen, staring at his young
master as though astounded at his audacity. <said>Warn't
a bit o' good, I reckon. He didn't give in to 'ee, main
fond as he be of 'ee.</said></p>

<p><said>Not an inch. See here, Steve, you could use your
fist very prettily when you were young, I'm told.</said></p>

<p><said>Aye—sure-<emph>ly</emph>,</said> chuckled the old groom. <said>There
warn't many at my weight as I couldn't down. I fought
at ten stun six, or thereabouts, an' I mind a merry little
mill on Stonebridge Common when——</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, I've heard of that Stonebridge Common affair,</said>
put in Jack remorselessly, cutting short a threatened
flood of reminiscences. <said>I know you're up to every
dodge where the ring's concerned and that's why I
want to ask you something. What do you think of
Tom Spring's chances against Bill Neate?</said></p>

<p>Steve spat on the ground and waved his currycomb to
emphasise his opinion.</p>

<p><said>Bill Neate 'll eat him. Spring wunna last half a
dozen rounds. Once Bill gets one of his hammer blows
in, Spring'll drop like that.</said></p>

<p>And down went the currycomb.</p>

<p><said>That's your opinion, is it. Well, I don't agree with
you.</said></p>

<p>Stephen fired up instantly. He was Bristol born and
bred, and he had more than once stood a pot of ale to
the <choice><corr>redoubtable</corr><orig>redoutable</orig></choice> Bill Neate. What better credential
could Bill have?</p>

<pb n="13"/>

<p><said>Master Jack, 'xcuse me a taaking the liberty, but
what I says is as 'ee don't know nothin' about it. Dang
it, I were fightin' afore 'ee was born or thought of.
Tom Spring be a clever boxer, I don't deny, but he
couldn't make a dent in a pound o' butter. Boxin's one
thing, fightin's another.</said></p>

<p>Jack didn't like this. It was the old difference with
the squire over again. His voice took a sudden sharp-
ness.</p>

<p><said>So it may be, but Spring can do both. Have you
ever seen him box?</said></p>

<p><said>Noa, but I've taaked wi' them as has. Mike
Devenish, the guard o' the Bristol Highflier, knows him
well. Mike's had many a pint wi' him at Tom Belcher's
house <q>The Castle,</q> Holborn, and seen him have a
set to at the Fives Court. Why, he's called the <q>ladies'
maid fighter.</q> What do 'ee think o' that, Master
Jack?</said></p>

<p><said>It's a lie and a slander,</said> retorted Jack angrily.
<said>I've had the gloves on with Spring and when I asked
him jokingly to give me a real punch, he broke through
my guard and I went down like a ninepin and lay like a
log for full five minutes.</said></p>

<p><said>What of it?</said> growled Steve. <said>You're not Bill
Neate.</said></p>

<p>The discussion grew hot, but quarrelling with Stephen
was very different from quarrelling with his stepfather.
Steve didn't lose his temper but argued purely on
technical and pugilistic grounds. Failing to convince
Jack how certain it was that Tom Spring must be
beaten, he wound up with:</p>

<p><said>Have your own way, Master Jack. I only hope as
'ee havn't rattled the squire. I know as he's put a
'undred or two on Bill Neate an' if he don't bring it
off there'll be the devil to pay.</said></p>

<p>This was news to Jack, but what did it matter.
Squire Halstead could well afford to lose a thousand or
two, let alone hundreds. The only thing was that if
Spring was the victor, it would add to the difficulty of
a reconciliation.</p>

<p>The talk, or rather discussion, with Stephen having
<pb n="14"/>
dribbled out, Jack cast about for something to occupy
his mind and calm his ruffled nerves. Stephen had
finished grooming the black hunter and was leading him
back to his stall a picture of symmetry and strength,
when an idea struck the young man. He was in the
mood for something daring, something which demanded
audacity</p>

<p><said>I say, Steve, is the black fit for thirty miles or so
to-night?</said></p>

<p><said>Aye, if need be. He bean't done more'n a couple
o' mile to-day. A bit o' stretchin' won't do him no
harm.</said></p>

<p><said>Right. Then clap a saddle on his back. I'll be
with you in five minutes or so.</said></p>

<p><said>What mad game be this?</said> muttered the old
groom, when he was left to himself. <said>Black Ivory</said>—
this was the name Simon had given to the hunter—
<said>wants a lot o' knowin'. All right when you <emph>do</emph> know,
but it's the first time Master Jack's put his legs across
the nag. If the two of 'em bean't o' the same mind look
out for mischief.</said></p>

<p>Jack came back booted and spurred and clad in a
tight-fitting coat that reached to his heels and a low
crowned hat with a broad brim. He looked the dashing
horseman from head to foot and Stephen nodded
approval.</p>

<p>Black Ivory seemed to scent the pleasure in store for
him. The feel of the saddle told him as much. He
was pawing the ground impatiently and when Jack
introduced himself by patting his neck and addressing
him as an old friend, he tossed his head in acquiescence.</p>

<p><said>We shall get on all right together,</said> said Jack.</p>

<p><said>Aye, it du look like it. But don't 'ee use the whip.
'E wunna stand it.</said></p>

<p><said>Just like me,</said> rejoined Jack lightly.</p>

<p>He placed his foot in the stirrup and vaulted into the
saddle, Steve standing at the horse's head the while,
though there was no necessity.</p>

<p><said>I don't know what time I shall be back, Steve, but
you needn't bother. I'll stable him.</said></p>

<p>Black Ivory needed neither spur nor whip. Jack
<pb n="15"/>
rode him out of the yard with a light rein. The first
thing to do was to put the animal on good terms with
himself, and by the ready way in which he broke into
an easy gallop, it was clear that this first step was
accomplished.</p>

<p>The young moon was rising and old Stephen stood at
the stable gate watching the fast receding figures of
horse and rider until the clopperty clopperty ring of
Black Ivory's hoofs on the hard road ceased.</p>

<p><said>He be a taakin' the Bath Road,</said> muttered the old
groom. <said>What's in the lad's mind? Wenches or
cards? It's all one to hot blood. Aye—aye. I weer
the same myself at his age. He—he!</said></p>

<p>And with a chuckle Steve went back to his horses.</p>

<p>It was just the night for a ride. There had been no
rain for at least a week and the road, like others in those
days, not too good, though the highways to Bath were
the best in the kingdom, was fairly hard and even, for
the ruts of winter had been worn down by the ponderous
wide-wheeled wagons.</p>

<p>Jack felt he was astride a fine roadster and maybe
Black Ivory had an equally good opinion of his rider.
Anyhow a certain sympathy had sprung up between
man and horse and Jack let his steed take his own pace.</p>

<p>The first three miles were covered in less than a
quarter of an hour. The country was open, low hedges
separating the road from wide spreading arable land.
At first Jack was conscious of little else besides a sense
of glorious exhilaration. The keen air, the rushing
through space in the exercise of muscular power were
sufficiently pleasurable. Then came the deep shadows of
a wood on either side and the horse of his own accord
dropped into a gentle canter.</p>

<p>There may have been something in the sudden black-
ness which sent Jack Ralstone thinking. He was
recalling his quarrel with his stepfather and the more
vivid the remembrance of the scene became, the more
he wondered at his own restraint, for the old man's
overbearing manner and offensive words were as much
as flesh and blood could bear.</p>

<p>Human nature instinctively leans towards the prin-
<pb n="16"/>
ciple of compensation. Let the balance be upset and
one's desire to restore things to their normal level must
be satisfied at all costs. Jack considered he had not
been treated justly, and the more he brooded over it
the more he yearned to have it out with something or
somebody. Half a dozen stinging retorts came into his
mind, which if he had only thought of at the time
would have given him at all events a verbal victory.</p>

<p><said>Instead of that I slunk off. Of course I know very
well that if I hadn't there'd have been a devil of a row,
but that isn't what old Halstead believes. His idea is
that when it comes to a push I daren't stand up to him.
If I was of his flesh and blood it would be different, but
as I'm not—well, we'll see.</said></p>

<p>And unintentionally he emphasised his words with a
smart blow on Black Ivory's flank. Instantly the in-
sulted animal reared, and Jack, taken unawares, was
nearly thrown. He also narrowly escaped smashing his
head against a low overhanging bough. The horse
evidently was very nervous and sensitive. Jack could
feel him quivering from head to foot; it was as much
as he could do to calm him. The slightest thing would
have sent him bolting, and the chances were a hundred
to one he would end by butting himself and his rider
into some tree.</p>

<p>At last by dint of exhortations and coaxings Black
Ivory condescended to proceed like a reasonable animal,
and the mingled din of twigs crashing beneath hoofs, of
snorting, and of Jack's loud-voiced remonstrances died
away. The end of the wood was not far off and the
rest of the road was traversed almost in silence, the
soddened leaves of winter furnishing a carpet soft
enough to muffle Black Ivory's tread.</p>

<p>Just as the horse emerged into the open the silence
was broken by a cry of pain. The voice was a woman's.
Jack halted and listened. It came again. He seemed
to distinguish the word, <q>Help!</q></p>

<p>Stunted hawthorn, holly bushes, tall withered bracken
and brambles extended some little distance beyond the
wood and then stretched an expanse of common on either
side. The cry came from the right hand and he could
see a yellow glare through the thickets. He rode on.
<pb n="17"/>
The glare issued from the open door of a travelling
caravan. On the ground about a yard from the caravan
he could see two dark forms in violent movement. One
was that of a man, the other a woman. The man had a
riding whip in his hand with which he was mercilessly
belabouring a woman who was vainly struggling to
release her arm from the fellow's grasp.</p>

<p>Jack's blood boiled at the sight. He dashed on to
the common, reined in his horse and shouted:</p>

<p><said>Stop that, you coward!</said></p>

<p><said>Mind your own business,</said> the fellow retorted, with
a few ornamental oaths thrown in.</p>

<p><said>It <emph>is</emph> my business. I'll make it so.</said></p>

<p>The next moment he had leaped from his horse and
was striding towards the ruffian. At last his chance of
getting rid of his bad blood and making things square
between himself and the world—otherwise his step-
father—had come.</p>

<p>The fellow ill-using the woman was stiffly built, with
a head round as a bullet and a neck like a bullock's.
His sleek hair was cut short and his prominent straight
square chin and thin lips indicated obstinacy and
cruelty. He had the high cheek protuberance of the
pugilist, and his small, glittering eyes were deep in their
sockets and well protected by an abnormal development
of the lower part of the frontal bone. He was clean
shaven save a fringe of whisker descending from his hair
as far as the lobe of the ear.</p>

<p>Jack Ralstone rapidly noted these characteristics.
To his mind the fellow looked like a bruiser; he might
be an ugly antagonist if it came to fisticuffs. Bruiser
or not, Jack went for him. The whip descended more
savagely than ever, as if to give a practical reply to a
stranger's threat of interference. Ralstone seized it,
and with a dexterous jerk of the wrist—a lesson learned
in the fencing school—wrenched it from the ruffian's
grasp before it reached its mark, and hurled it half a
dozen yards through the air.</p>

<p><said>Curse your meddling. Take that,</said> roared the
bruiser, with a volley of imprecations.</p>

<p>Flinging the girl aside, he sent in a straight blow,
<pb n="18"/>
which, if it had found Jack's face, would have felled
him as by the kick of a horse. But Ralstone expected
something of the kind, and he ducked in the very
nick of time. The fellow's arm went over his
shoulder, and he was able to reply with a vicious
hit on the point of the chin. The man staggered.
Jack's fist had caught him on one of a boxer's vulner-
able points.</p>

<p>The man stood for a moment motionless, as if amazed
at the failure of his attack. Then, thrusting forward
his head with a jerk, his arms straight down, his fists
clenched, he glared savagely at Ralstone, like a tiger
defrauded of his prey.</p>

<p><said>Oh, you want a hammerin', do you?</said> he growled.
<said>Then we'll peel, and you shall have it in style. Theer
won't be much o' the swell left in you when you're
knocked out. It'll take your mother all her time to
know you after I'm done wi' you.</said></p>

<p>He tugged at his muffler, stripped off his thick coat
and tucked up his ragged shirt-sleeves. Jack saw he
was in for a real <soCalled>mill,</soCalled> and he followed suit, throwing
his long coat over Black Ivory's back. The horse was
profoundly indifferent to his rider's coming ordeal, and
was quietly nibbling at the short grass.</p>

<p>It was the first time Jack Ralstone had fought with
his bare knuckles since he was a lad. He had had, how-
ever, a good training in fisticuffs at Eton, and was
reckoned one of the best at the game, and when he fought
a bargee lad, two years older than himself, and taller
and stronger, in a meadow bordering the Thames towing
path, and beat him, he was the acknowledged champion
of the school.</p>

<p>It was strange that, while his nerves were <q>jumpy</q>
when he was in the wood, fretting and fuming over the
scene with the squire, now that he was in danger of a
<soCalled>hammering,</soCalled> as the fellow put it, they were as taut
as tightly stretched whipcord. His brain was cool, and
he had perfect command over himself.</p>

<p>During the process of peeling he had time to run his
eye over the <soCalled>points</soCalled> of his enemy. The pale moon-
light fell upon the man's face and revealed puffy cheeks
<pb n="19"/>
and watery eyes, which told of strong ale and gin. Jack
also noticed that elsewhere he was not in the pink of
condition. There was far too much fat in the region of
the waistcoat. This decided the tactics he meant to
adopt.</p>

<p>The two combatants presented a strong contrast.
Jack was quite four inches taller and much longer in the
reach. He was as lithe and active as a deer, but he had
not exchanged half a dozen blows before he realised that
he should need all his activity, for the other was as
tricky as a monkey, and had no scruple in abandoning
the rules of the prize ring. He was bent upon knocking
out the <soCalled>swell</soCalled> by fair means or foul.</p>

<p>Jack went at him at first a bit too hurriedly, trying to
smash him up right off. A heavy fall, he knew, would
wind the fellow, and that would be worth any number
of blows. However, at first he had to hit where he
could, and, seeing an opening for an upper cut where he
had struck him before—on the point of the chin—he
went for it. But as he led off his antagonist bobbed like
lightning to one side, and Jack's hand slipped over the
man's well-greased poll like a pat of butter across the
bottom of a hot frying-pan, and Jack got an awkward
dint in the ribs that made him wince. It was evident
that his opponent knew the game, and was not to be
caught a second time.</p>

<p>The man saw he had got home, and made a rush to
repeat the dose. Owing to his inferiority in height and
reach, body blows were easier than attempts at Jack's
head, well thrown back as it was. Jack pulled himself
together, and began to keep away, making the best of
his superiority at out-fighting and watching for an
opportunity to retaliate. Meanwhile it was all dodging
and foot work, and he was dancing about so as to tire
his man. As they were not within the confines of a
twenty-four foot ring, the effect of being kept constantly
on the go soon had its effect on his antagonist, whose
want of condition was beginning to tell upon him.</p>

<p>He was starting to breathe heavily. He had to labour
to keep up with Jack; he was getting weak on his pins,
and, one foot chancing to slip on a hard and slippery
<pb n="20"/>
bit of turf, Jack saw his chance and got in a fierce one
on the solar plexus, known as the <soCalled>mark,</soCalled> close to the
midriff. The man was bent with pain, and before he
could recover himself Jack had hurled him to the
ground. He pitched on to his head, and there he lay
like a log.</p>

<p>At the same moment an old hag who, unseen by Jack,
had been standing at the door of the caravan watching
the fight all the time, rushed to the prostrate man, and
between her revilings of Jack Ralstone for <q>killing</q> her
<q>boy</q> she raised her voice in a violent screech for
<q>Mike!</q></p>

<p>Jack, seeing he was in no further danger, looked
round for the woman for whom he had fought. He
could see her on the other side of Black Ivory near the
horse's head. As a matter of fact, she was holding the
bridle. He ran to her.</p>

<p><said>Thank you, sir—oh, thank you,</said> he heard her say
breathlessly; <said>but I almost wish you hadn't done it.</said></p>

<p><said>What d'you mean?</said></p>

<p><said>Jerry'll half kill me if he gets hold of me again.
But I'm not going to stay. Thanks to you, I've got
the chance to get away, and I'll take it.</said></p>

<p>She turned as if to run, but Jack caught hold of her
shawl. It had slipped down to her waist. The upper
part of her bodice was torn and the contour of her
shoulders and bust was revealed. The lines were finely
cut and as full of harmonious curves as those of a piece
of old Greek statuary.</p>

<p>She was little more than a slip of a girl. A wealth
of black hair, slightly coarse in texture, streamed over
her face and back, and through its entanglement
gleamed a pair of large lustrous eyes, dark as midnight.
The rest of the face was hardly distinguishable.</p>

<p><said>You want to get away, my lass, do you?</said> muttered
Jack between his set teeth. <said>By the lord you shall.
Up with you. Quick! You're but a featherweight.
My horse'll take the pair of us.</said></p>

<p>She understood him. A toss of the head, a swift
glance of her big eyes, which seemed to go straight to
his heart, and one of her feet was planted in the stirrup.
<pb n="21"/>
He held out his hand for the support of the other foot
as she sprang upwards, a swish of her scanty skirt, a
momentary glance of a slender shapely ankle, and she
was on the horse's back. Jack instantly vaulted into
the saddle.</p>

<p><said>Arms round my waist,</said> said he rapidly. <said>Clip me
tightly, and away we go.</said></p>

<p>So in pillion fashion they darted off, Black Ivory as
keen as his riders.</p>

<p>At that moment came a flash amid the gorse, the
sharp report of a gun was heard, and a whistle followed,
close to Jack's ear. It was the rush of the bullet from
the fowling piece of the poacher whom the old woman
had summoned.</p>

<p><said>All right, my girl,</said> laughed Jack. <said>A miss is as
good as a mile!</said></p>

</div>


<div n="2" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="2">II</num></head>
<head type="main">Vanished!</head>

<p>Another shot came—wider of the mark than the first.
The fowling piece was evidently double-barrelled and
doubtless faulty, or the poacher was a bad shot. The
matter was not of the slightest consequence, for Black
Ivory tore along at his hardest. In a few minutes he
was out of range.</p>

<p>Jack felt strangely elated. The <soCalled>scrap</soCalled> with the
<soCalled>bruiser</soCalled> had strung up his sinews and tested his nerve
and skill as a boxer, and he had come through the ordeal
triumphantly. He interpreted the pressure of the girl's
arms, the close contact of her supple, yielding body, as
a fitting reward for his prowess.</p>

<p>For the first two miles neither spoke. The clatter of
the horse's hoofs made too much noise for talk to be
heard, and somehow the singular combination of his
first essay as a knight rescuing a damsel in distress
savoured so much of romance that his brain was be-
wildered. The Waverley novels were all the rage.
Jack's tastes were not wholly confined to sport, and
<pb n="22"/>
he had devoured Sir Walter's picturesque descriptions
of besieged castles, tournaments, hand-to-hand fights
and mediaeval bouts generally, with delight. At that
moment in imagination he was Ivanhoe, or the Knight
Templar; he did not care which. The point was that
he was carrying off a girl, where to he did not know,
nor did he trouble.</p>

<p>One thought certainly did haunt him more than the
rest. What was the girl like? He had only seen her
eyes and the tip of a rounded chin. The head was
shapely and the hair abundant, while her form—well,
all argued in favour of beauty, but who could say?
Supposing she were pock-marked, too frequent a dis-
figurement in those days, or had but one eye or was
possessed of a pug-nose, and maybe had lost a front
tooth or two? But all this was impossible, so he con-
tended, and he dismissed the disquieting supposition
with scorn. He was filled with the spirit of chivalry.
At the same time he could not help wondering whether
he would have interfered so heroically had she been old
or ugly. He hoped his conduct would have been the
same.</p>

<p>Black Ivory had exhausted his <soCalled>breather,</soCalled> and had
dropped into a canter to get his second wind. Jack
allowed him to take his own course. He was moving
softly over a long strip of grass by the roadside. The
going here was easier, and the bumping over the ruts
had not been too comfortable, either for the gentleman
in the saddle or for the lady riding pillion.</p>

<p><said>How are you doing?</said> said he over his shoulder.
<said>Pretty snug? A rough ride, wasn't it? You were
jumping up and down like a parched pea in a frying-
pan.</said></p>

<p><said>I couldn't help it. I hope I don't inconvenience you.
I shall never forget your bravery and kindness,</said> he
heard her whisper in his ear.</p>

<p>Her head was very close to his. But that was not of
the slightest consequence. Indeed, he rather liked it.
She had slightly loosened her arms. He wished she
hadn't. It was a novel sensation to be conscious of her
heart-beats. The rapid movement, the oscillation, the
<pb n="23"/>
bumping, had sent the blood galloping through her
veins and through his too.</p>

<p><said>Bravery—oh, there wasn't much in that,</said> he re-
joined in a careless, slightly boastful tone. <said>I was
rather glad to have a chance of seeing how I could
manage my fists in real earnest. As for kindness—well,
I don't see what was to be done other than what I did.
Suppose we talk about the next step. I reckon we're
now about eight miles from Bath. What are you going
to do when we get there?</said></p>

<p><said>I don't know.</said></p>

<p><said>Got any friends there?</said></p>

<p><said>No.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, I can't plant you in Bath without any idea
as to what is to become of you, can I?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, you needn't trouble about me any more.
You've done quite enough. Please put me down now.</said></p>

<p><said>What for? Would you rather not go on to Bath?</said></p>

<p><said>It doesn't matter much where I go.</said></p>

<p><said aloud="false">Doesn't it?</said> thought Jack. <said aloud="false">What a queer
thing to say. She speaks well—like a lady. How the
deuce did she come to be mixed up with these tramps?</said></p>

<p><said>Then you may as well go on with me to Bath,</said>
said he aloud.</p>

<p><said>As you like. Only I warn you that when we get
there we must say good-bye.</said></p>

<p><said>So we will when the time comes. We haven't
reached the good-byeing point yet.</said></p>

<p>They relapsed into silence. Jack Ralstone did not
want to embarrass her with questions, though he was
burning to know more about her. Besides, the strip of
grass had come to an end; Black Ivory was once more
plunging amid the ruts and the bumping had begun
again.</p>

<p>In half an hour the lights of Bath were just visible.
Nothing more than a faint glare, for gas had not then
been introduced into the city, though the new illuminant
had been made use of in many of the main London
streets.</p>

<p>There were two high roads between Bristol and Bath.
Jack had taken what was called the upper one, and for
<pb n="24"/>
a particular reason—it entered Bath bordering the
Barton Fields, an ornamental enclosure overlooked by
Royal Crescent, an imposing row of stone houses in
the Italian style, favoured by the Prince Regent and
his architect, Nash.</p>

<p>In Royal Crescent, Lady Barbara Dacre was lodging
for a course of the waters, recommended by her London
physician, which in her case meant balls, routs, mas-
querades, concerts, the theatre, card-playing and the
like frivolities.</p>

<p>Jack drew rein at the quiet-looking inn in the out-
skirts. He was parched with thirst, partly the effect
of his strenuous encounter and partly due to his gallop.
Black Ivory had to be watered, and he did not doubt
that the girl would find some stimulant welcome. He
shouted and an ostler came to the head of the horse.</p>

<p>The man cast a glance of surprise at the rider and
his burden. The contrast between the two justified
his look. A fine gentleman—there was no doubt about
this by Jack's air of authority and the imperious tone
of his voice—and a poorly dressed girl not much better
than a vagrant. The ostler would have been reminded
of King Cophetua and the beggar had he known the
story.</p>

<p>Jack sprang to the ground and helped the girl to
dismount.</p>

<p><said>Thank you kindly, sir,</said> said she; <said>and now please
we'll part.</said></p>

<p><said>Will we? Don't be in a hurry, lass. I——</said></p>

<p>He stopped, hardly knowing what to say. The extra-
ordinary loveliness of the girl had struck him spell-
bound.</p>

<p>Her figure was as attractive as her face. Although
below middle height, she was perfectly proportioned
and, slim though she was, there was no suggestion of
scragginess. All was soft, yielding, harmonious. Spon-
taneity and grace marked every movement in a way
that partook of the sunny clime of Spain and Italy.
Anyway, Jack, when he had time to think over the
matter, was sure that foreign blood was in her veins.</p>

<p>In some wonderful way, known only to women, she
<pb n="25"/>
had arranged her hair—at least it was thrown back
fairly neatly each side of her forehead, smoothed behind
her head. She had probably found a chance to do it
when Black Ivory was cantering over the strip of turf.
Of course it had been hurriedly done, and a rebel tress
or two had escaped and gave a wild picturesqueness to
her beauty.</p>

<p>A face as delicately outlined as a cameo was revealed.
The eyes were so large, so lustrous, that at the first
glance one lost sight of the finely cut, full lips, the
slightly aquiline nose, the round chin cleft by a little
dimple, the sweeping line from the small ear defining
the lower jaw. Pride and courage were written in the
nose, the firm lips and chin, and the dark eyes looked
as if they could flash into anger as readily as they could
melt into tenderness. The features were those of a
girl born for adventure. It was impossible to associate
them with anything humdrum or commonplace.</p>

<p>Jack was fascinated. He stared at the girl so fixedly
that she cast down her eyes and her clear olive cheeks
crimsoned.</p>

<p><said>I beg your pardon,</said> he exclaimed involuntarily.</p>

<p><said>I don't see why you should. You've done nothing
to offend me.</said></p>

<p><said>I hope not. You see, I was so taken by surprise,</said>
said he, with an ingenuous confusion. <said>I did not
expect &#x2026; well,</said> he went on desperately, <said>we
mustn't part like this. You forget I never saw you
before an hour ago—didn't know you were in the
world.</said></p>

<p>The ghost of a smile crossed the lips.</p>

<p><said>All the more reason why you should forget me.
You've done me a great service, sir, and I thank you
sincerely.</said></p>

<p>She put out her hand, and he took it, but it was not
with the intention of saying good-bye.</p>

<p><said>I pulled up here to offer you some refreshment—
you must need it. The house is a quiet one. I know
the landlord. I often ride to Bath.</said></p>

<p>As he uttered the last words he felt the prickings
of conscience. Lady Barbara Dacre came into his
<pb n="26"/>
mind. It was to see her that he rode so often to Bath.
This, indeed, was his mission to-night. Because he was
betrothed, should speaking to other women be debarred
him? But this was more than speaking—it was
fascination. He had no business to be tempted by a
beautiful face and to forget his betrothed. For Lady
Barbara was beautiful too, but in a style very different
from that of this interesting stranger.</p>

<p>These scruples passed from his mind almost as soon
as they entered it. Youth is not given either to make
or weigh nice distinctions. It is impulsive, impression-
able, or it is not youth.</p>

<p><said>Some port wine negus—you must. Please.</said></p>

<p>He put his arm round her waist to urge her. She
gently disengaged herself.</p>

<p><said>No. I can't go into that place with you. I should
disgrace so fine a gentleman. What would your friend
the landlord think of you—of me? That I was some
trull you had picked up on the roadside. It's im-
possible.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm sorry,</said> said Jack penitently. <said>Yes, I suppose
you're right, but, you see, I only saw your face. I
never looked at your dress. Forgive me. Anyhow
you must have something. It's a chilly night, and
you're none too warmly clothed—I apologise for again
alluding to your dress.</said></p>

<p><said>It doesn't matter. I'm used to what I'm wearing,
and as I can't get any other, I put up with it. I know
I look like a beggar.</said></p>

<p>Jack was of opinion that a more delightful figure in
rags and tatters he had never seen in his life. The
wonderful thing was that with all her shabbiness there
was no suggestion of degradation. She seemed to be
one of those natural daughters of Eve who have the
faculty of adapting themselves to any kind of costume
and always looking handsome in it.</p>

<p><said>But the port wine negus,</said> he rejoined obstinately,
<said>and a biscuit. I'll bring them out to you here.</said></p>

<p>Perhaps with a view not to appear ungrateful, rather
than that she needed anything, the girl raised no objec-
tion, and he darted off and entered the snug bar parlour
<pb n="27"/>
of the <q>Angel and Sun.</q> Half a dozen men were
talking animatedly, but in subdued voices, and when
Jack came in they ceased their conversation and glanced
at him askance.</p>

<p>In the centre of the group was the landlord, a burly
man in shirt-sleeves and apron, with a face as ex-
pressionless as wood. He brightened, however, when he
recognised his customer.</p>

<p><said>Evenin', squire,</said> said he, with his forefinger at the
lovelock with which his forehead was adorned. <said>Boys,
this is Squire Jack, as clean a fighter as ever stepped.
I've seen him box. No going down wi' him to sneak
out o' punishment.</said></p>

<p><said>That'll do, Ben Stone. None of your flattery,</said>
laughed Jack. <said>I haven't come for that, but for
some port wine negus. I've got a friend outside in the
cold waiting for it, so be quick.</said></p>

<p><said>You shall have it, sir, as soon as the fire can heat
it. But I've got summat to tell 'ee. Danged if you
haven't come in the very nick. There's no need to
stop a ta-aking, neighbours. Squire Jack's one of us
and what we tell him munna go no further. Squire,
here's Tom Belcher comed straight fro' Lunnon, an'
what about, think 'ee?</said> And Ben Stone nodded and
winked mysteriously.</p>

<p>A glow of admiration went over Jack Ralstone. To
be introduced to Tom Belcher, who, if not so redoubt-
able a hero as his brother Jim, was yet a famous fighter,
to shake him by the hand was an honour indeed.</p>

<p>Tom Belcher was a Bristol man, and naturally swore
hard and fast by his fellow citizen, Bill Neate. Tom
Belcher kept the Castle Tavern in Holborn, in its
later days known as the <q>Napier.</q> It was said that
no man knew better how to get up a purse, make a
match or back a man than Tom Belcher. He had
come to Somersetshire on very special business, as Jack
was soon to learn.</p>

<p><said>Tom Spring's a rare good 'un I admit,</said> said Belcher
cautiously, <said>and it ain't for me to say a word against
him, but I'm Bill Neate's man an' I back him thick
an' thin. As Ben Stone stands surety for you, sir,
<pb n="28"/>
p'raps you'd like to know as we've fixed up a place for
the ring, and not so very fur away from here.</said></p>

<p><said>What,</said> exclaimed Jack joyfully, <said>in Somerset-
shire?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, blow Somerset. Your Somerset bench o'
justices are a set o' noodles. They're throwing thou-
sands o' pounds away as 'ud have been brought into
the county if they'd ha' let the fight come off in Bill's
native place. No, we've pitched upon a likely spot in
Hampshire, not more'n a mile from Weyhill.</said></p>

<p>Belcher dropped his voice almost to a whisper as
he let out this important piece of information. The
farce of stopping prize fights was sometimes gone
through if direct information came to the ears of the
authorities, otherwise, more often than not they shut
their ears and their eyes too, to exhibitions of what was
then believed to be the national sport.</p>

<p><said>There won't be any hitch then,</said> said Jack. <said>The
Hampshire magistrates are not so pigheaded as our
bigwigs. And the day, is that fixed too?</said></p>

<p><said>No, but Stone'll know it as soon as anybody. I
take it, sir, you're putting a few guineas on Neate?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, no,</said> rejoined Jack frankly, <said>I rather
believe in Spring.</said></p>

<p>Something like a snort of contempt and incredulity
went up. They were all in Neate's favour and prepared
to back their favourite.</p>

<p><said>Then, sir, with all due respect to you as a gentleman,
I won't say as your judgment mayn't be right, but I'll
make bold to assert as you're in a fair way to lose your
coin.</said></p>

<p><said>I'll take the risk of that, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Belcher,</said> rejoined
Jack cheerfully, <said>and I'll go further. I'm open to
back Spring at this moment up to any reasonable
amount. How's the betting in London?</said></p>

<p><said>Five to one on Neate.</said></p>

<p><said>Good. Is any gentleman willing to take me five
to one in tens?</said></p>

<p><said>That'll suit my books,</said> said a tall, wiry man whom
Jack knew to be a wealthy grazier of the neighbourhood.
<said>What d'ye say, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone—up to fifty pounds?</said></p>

<pb n="29"/>

<p><said>I don't mind, Dillnot,</said> returned Jack carelessly,
and booked the bet.</p>

<p><said>Who's the youngster?</said> whispered a wizen-faced,
high cheek-boned man of mean appearance despite his
good clothes. <said>Is he good for paying up?</said></p>

<p><said>Good for paying up,</said> growled Dillnot, to whom the
question was put. <said>If he bean't, his stepfather,
Simon Halstead be. Simon's rolling in gold they say
and dotes on the lad, though he bean't his flesh an'
blood. Young Ralstone can't do no wrong in the old
man's eyes.</said></p>

<p><said>If you're still on, sir, I'll take you up to one
hundred,</said> he said.</p>

<p><said>And who may you be?</said> said Jack coldly. He did
not like the look of the man. <said>I don't care to bet with
strangers.</said></p>

<p><said>My name's Weare, and my address is Lyons Inn.
As for money, if that's your doubt, I can satisfy you.</said></p>

<p>He thrust his hand within the breast of his coat,
pulled out a pocket-book and opened it with a flourish.
It was stuffed with bank-notes. He replaced the books,
put his hand in his breeches pocket and produced a
leather bag. On untying the string it was shown to
be full of guineas.</p>

<p><said>Is that evidence enough that I shall pay my debts?
<choice><corr>They're</corr><orig>Theyre</orig></choice> as good gold as was ever minted.</said></p>

<p>He shook out a handful and rang one on the table
ostentatiously.</p>

<p><said>What about that sound? Something like music,
eh?</said></p>

<p><said>You're a fool, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Weare, to flash your gold and
notes about like that,</said> remonstrated the landlord.
<said>It'll get you into trouble one of these fine days.
Gentlemen of the High Toby game bean't stamped out
yet.</said></p>

<p><said>Your highwaymen are not likely to tackle me,</said>
rejoined Weare contemptuously. <said>I never travel alone,
and they daren't attack stage coaches nowadays. But
about this bet, young gentleman? Are you on?</said></p>

<p><said>If you like,</said> said Jack, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p><said>Up to one hundred pounds?</said></p>

<pb n="30"/>

<p><said>Up to five hundred pounds. I don't care.</said></p>

<p>Jack Ralstone was netted by the other's boasting
manner, and would have gone on to a thousand pounds
if need be.</p>

<p><said>No, a hundred's enough for me—with a stranger.</said></p>

<p>Jack's brow darkened, but he said nothing. He
booked the bet and looked round defiantly.</p>

<p>The men clearly thought a pigeon had descended
among them. and a few more challenges were thrown
out and accepted. Jack Ralstone had plunged to over
one thousand pounds—if luck went against him.</p>

<p><said>What about your port wine negus, Squire,</said> put in
the landlord. <said>It's been hotted five minutes and
more.</said></p>

<p>Jack started. In his enthusiasm over Tom Spring,
and in the excitement of betting, he had clean forgotten
the girl who was waiting in the cold. He was horribly
angry with himself, and seizing the tankard and a wine-
glass he hurried out.</p>

<p>She was not to be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>Joe, the ostler, was moving about with a stable
lantern. Jack hailed him.</p>

<p><said>She went off soon arter your honour wen' inside.</said></p>

<p><said>The deuce she did. Which way did she go?</said></p>

<p><said>I dunno, sir The wench warn't aught to me, an'
thinks I, the Squire'll be main glad to rid himself of
her.</said></p>

<p><said>You fool,</said> shouted Jack. <said>I've a mind to give you
a hiding for your stupidity. What business have you
to think about what I'm glad or sorry for?</said></p>

<p>He was intensely angry; stamped his foot and
slashed his riding whip.</p>

<p><said>She seemed a bit of a wagabone, an' I thought——</said></p>

<p><said>The devil take your thoughts. Which way did
she turn? Come, you must know that.</said></p>

<p><said>Noa, I doan't. If your honour had only told me,
I'd ha' kept her. She raced away quite sudden like,
wi'out sayin' good night nor nuthen. It were arter I
told her your name. She asked me who you was.
That's Squire Jack Halstead, I says. <q>Halstead,</q> says
she, wi' a sort o' squark, as if she was frightened, <q>not
<pb n="31"/>
the son of Simon Halstead?</q> The same, I says, and
with that she swishes round and does a bolt like a mad
filly.</said></p>

<p>It was strange, and the ostler's story furnished no
solution of the mystery. Why should the mention of
his stepfather's name produce so singular an effect
upon the girl?</p>

<p><said>What on earth made you say my name was Halstead,
you infernal blunderer?</said> suddenly broke out Jack.
<said>You know as well as I do that it's Ralstone, and that
Simon Halstead isn't my father.</said></p>

<p>The ostler scratched his grizzled head. He hadn't
any particular reason to give, excepting that his honour
was generally called Squire Jack Halstead at the <q>Angel
and Sun.</q></p>

<p>Jack Ralstone came to the conclusion that it would
be a waste of time and temper to find any further fault
with the man who was little more than a dull clod, and
he strode back into the inn, emptying the tankard of
negus on the ground on the way, so that he should
have to give no explanation to the landlord.</p>

<p>It was due to him as a gentleman to spend some
money for <soCalled>the good of the house,</soCalled> and he called for
a couple of bottles of wine, of which everybody had
his share. Dillnot was not to be outdone by the young
squire, and when the two bottles were emptied, he
ordered two more. By the time Jack left the inn to
finish the night at Bath, he was in the mood to be very
jolly or very quarrelsome, according to circumstance.
He decided that to walk the rest of the way, about a
mile, rather than ride, would steady his nerves. So he
stabled Black Ivory at the <q>Angel and Sun,</q> and
proceeded on foot to <q>Royal Crescent.</q></p>

<div n="3" type="chapter">
<pb n="32"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="3">III</num></head>
<head type="main">Two Men and a Woman</head>

<p><said>Her ladyship's out, sir. She's gone to the Masquerade
at the Assembly Rooms,</said> was the footman's answer to
Ralstone's inquiry for Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>Jack's temper took the direction of quarrelsomeness.
What business had the lady he was going to marry to
attend a masquerade without giving him the chance of
accompanying her? She might easily have written.
With whom had she gone?</p>

<p>His brow darkened. Until this moment he hadn't
cared very much where Lady Barbara went, either with
him or without him. The truth was he had given her
very little thought. She always struck him as rather
cold and haughty, and he'd never taken the trouble
to attempt to thaw her iciness. Owing to the arrange-
ment between Simon and the Duke of Endsleigh, there
had been very little wooing on his part. He had been
contented to accept the situation. There was some-
thing novel in the sensation of being engaged to be
married, and at the same time retaining his freedom.
He was rather inclined to laugh at the idea of a man
being tied to a lady's apron strings.</p>

<p>But now? A curious pang had shot through his
heart. For the first time in his life he knew what
jealousy meant. Why was he so changed? Lady
Barbara had, he knew full well, gone to balls, routs
and the theatre without him, and why not to a
masquerade?</p>

<p>Jack could not explain why he had suddenly felt so
angry, and he did not attempt to find an explanation.
It might have been due to the effects of Ben Stone's
heady port, but the reason was of no consequence.
All that was plain to him was that he was in the mood
for love-making, and he had looked forward to a few
pleasant moments with his betrothed. He had had
none up to the present—that is to say, there had been
no sweetheart exchanges between them.</p>

<pb n="33"/>

<p>Had Jack Ralstone ever bothered himself about the
psychology of love, he might have found a cause for
his perplexity in some disturbance of the nerve centres,
brought about by the sudden intrusion into his life
of the fascinating dark-eyed girl, whose face still
haunted him, despite his pursuit of Lady Barbara.
Because he had fought in her defence she had been
brought very near to him. Had he had the same
opportunity over Lady Barbara, it might have infused
that romance which would have made his engagement
interesting. But he hadn't. Everything had gone on
so placidly that he sometimes felt bored.</p>

<p>But not to-night. He had made the discovery that
women were highly provocative, even when they did
not intend to be. It was their way, but Jack Ralstone
was too little acquainted with that way to realise what
he was up against. Anyhow, his humour just then
was to assert his rights. Lady Barbara was his, and as
he had been vexed by the disappearance of a pair of
black eyes, why shouldn't he console himself with a
pair of blue ones? So he strode away at a smart pace
to the Assembly Rooms.</p>

<p>The approaches to this favourite resort of fashionable
Bath were blocked up by chariots, family coaches, sedan
chairs. Footmen jostled each other, coachmen swore
at their rebellious horses, chairmen quarrelled, link-
boys yelled. Crowds of humble folk had assembled to
have a sight of the <soCalled>quality,</soCalled> and the Assembly Rooms
attendants and peace officers were busy in keeping back
the rabble, so as to allow the fine ladies and their cava-
liers to descend from their vehicles and, enter the vesti-
bule in comfort.</p>

<p>Jack Ralstone easily elbowed his way through the
crowd and passed in without question. He tackled one
of the M.C.s in the ante-chamber outside the octagonal
reception-room. He satisfied the official that he was
of sufficient standing in county society to be admitted
and disappeared into the room set apart for providing
dominoes and masks. The rules as to dress were relaxed
for masquerades, and he wore his riding hat. It went
very well with his dark blue domino.</p>

<pb n="34"/>

<p>The festivities had not long commenced, and the
reception-room was crowded. Not all the ladies wore
dominoes, but every one was masked. The short-
waisted dresses, if not so low cut in the corsage as in
the days of the directoire, were yet sufficiently daring.
Knee breeches had given place to trousers, in spite of
Almack's lady autocrats who, some ten years previous,
had denied admission to the Duke of Wellington because
of his wearing the objectionable nether garments intro-
duced by the Regent after much controversy, but they
had not wholly disappeared. Jack's riding breeches
and boots, visible, despite his domino, were, however,
inadmissible, and he was stopped at the entrance of
the ball-room by one of the M.C.s, who, pointing to the
young man's legs, politely but severely remarked that
his dress was not suitable for dancing.</p>

<p><said>Possibly I shan't dance,</said> was Jack's answer.</p>

<p><said>That makes no difference. I cannot admit you.
The rules are rigid in such a case.</said></p>

<p>Jack knew this perfectly well, but it had not occurred
to him until brought to his notice.</p>

<p><said>What am I to do? I particularly want to see a
lady who I know is in the room.</said></p>

<p><said>I regret that you should he disappointed, sir, but
it must he evident to you that the regulations cannot
be infringed.</said></p>

<p><said>I shall remain where I am until I see her.</said></p>

<p><said>As you please. I'm not quite sure whether you
ought even to remain in the reception-room dressed as
you are.</said></p>

<p>Jack bit his lip, but he had to content himself with
a protest.</p>

<p><said>If I allow you to stay here, you must give me your
word as a gentleman that you will not go an inch into
the ball-room.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, you may have my word.</said></p>

<p>The M.C. bowed and walked away.</p>

<p>That day seemed bent on being full of annoyances
and disappointments. Jack moved a little distance
from the door, as dancers were going in and out. He
paced up and down, now and again casting a glance at
<pb n="35"/>
the gaiety in which he was not permitted to participate.
The minuet, though maintained longer in Bath than in
London, had been voted old-fashioned. The Scottish
reel, fashionable in the early days of the Regency, had
died out; country dances had lost their popularity,
and in 1823 the French quadrille was the rage.</p>

<p>With vexation and anger in his heart, contending one
against the other, Jack Ralstone watched the dancers.
The <q>setting to partners,</q> the <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">chassez croisez</foreign></q> did
not interest him. The caperings in the elaborate
evolutions of <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">La Trenise,</foreign></q> otherwise the fourth figure
in those days of the quadrille, when the gentlemen had
to execute a <foreign xml:lang="fr">pas seul</foreign>, not a little embarrassing to the
nervous performer, excited his contempt.</p>

<p>Gleaming shoulders, round arms, glimpses of white
bosoms, disclosed by the loose, short-waisted dresses,
the whirling of supple forms, more or less graceful, did
not rouse his admiration. Women had, for the time
being, lost their charm. He was at war with Eve.
She was created for the irritation of man.</p>

<p>For all that he tried his hardest to distinguish Lady
Barbara. He fancied he ought to be able to pick out
her tall Juno-like figure, her rich auburn hair and
swimming movements amid a thousand women. But
he failed, and this increased his ill-temper.</p>

<p>The quadrille came to an end. The ladies were
conducted to the rout seats ranged round the walls, to
the ante-rooms for ices and negus and lemonade, and
a buzz of talk and laughter succeeded the sliding of
feet and the swish of skirts. A few couples were prom-
enading. Two or three of the dancers, feeling the heat
and choking from the dust and powder ascending from
the well-chalked floor, had shifted their masks.</p>

<p>One couple was approaching the entrance. The
lady was still masked. The gentleman had removed
his. Ralstone had known this gentleman perfectly well
in London. He was Sir Phineas Tenbury, a captain in
the Guards. Tenbury had, as a subaltern, fought at
Waterloo, and since then had made a reputation as a
man about town. He was a notorious evil liver, was
a reckless gambler, a crack shot and a skilled duellist.
<pb n="36"/>
His intrigues were numberless, and it was perilous to a
lady's reputation to be seen often in Sir Phineas
Tenbury's company.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas's companion had the brilliant colouring
and the wondrously clear skin characteristic of the
Somersetshire women. She was tall and Nature had
dealt generously with her figure. Her neck and bust
were superb; her arms beautifully moulded. Her hair
was of the tawny shade between auburn and brown,
without the slightest tinge of the brick-dust hue. Jack
Ralstone's pulses leaped. She could be no other than
Lady Barbara. But with Sir Phineas Tenbury?
Surely her ladyship would not descend to dance with
so profound a profligate as <soCalled>hell rake</soCalled> Tenbury!</p>

<p>Sir Phineas was smiling and whispering. If looks
could tell anything, he was beseeching a favour. He
was gazing ardently into the deep violet-blue eyes,
which, seen through the apertures of the mask, were
delightfully entrancing. Jack had never known that
soft, bewitching gleam in them which he now beheld.</p>

<p>The favour was granted. She shrugged her round
shoulders coquettishly and slipped off her mask. She
was then within a yard or so of the doorway. It was
she—Lady Barbara Dacre.</p>

<p>Ralstone made a hasty step forward and also removed
his mask. Their eyes met. His were blazing with
wrath; hers suddenly went cold and steely. His
presence clearly was not acceptable.</p>

<p><said>I fear I'm here at a wrong moment. I beg your
ladyship's pardon,</said> said Jack, bowing low.</p>

<p><said>Not at all,</said> rejoined Lady Barbara, flirting her fan
haughtily. <said>How can you be? I see you haven't
come to dance.</said></p>

<p>Her eyes went over his dress and he wished he hadn't
spoken. He felt at a horrible disadvantage, especially,
as with the corner of his eye, he had caught sight of
Tenbury's sneering lip.</p>

<p><said>Does that matter?</said> he blurted out.</p>

<p><said>Hardly. Has anything happened that you should
ride to Bath post haste, as I presume you have by the
mud on your coat.</said></p>

<pb n="37"/>

<p><said>A tussle with a foot-pad, maybe,</said> put in Sir Phineas
sarcastically. <said>A mouse under the eye suggests that
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone came off second best.</said></p>

<p>The evidence of the fight with the bruiser was another
thing which Jack had forgotten when he presented
himself for admission. No wonder the M.C. was
scandalised, though he was far too polite to allude to
the disfigurement. Sir Phineas had no such scruple.
Apparently he wanted to lower Ralstone in the eyes
of his betrothed. But Jack was not in the mood to
pass over Tenbury's insolence.</p>

<p><said>I shall be pleased to go through a similar perform-
ance with you, Sir Phineas. It will satisfy me if I
serve you as I served my antagonist, who, you may
like to know, was no foot pad, but was a fellow, I
fancy, who knew something about a twenty-four foot
ring.</said></p>

<p><said>Then it was a mill,</said> drawled the baronet, sticking
his glass in his eye. <said>At a boxing match, I presume?</said></p>

<p><said>Whether at a boxing booth or at Castellani's, I
believe I've managed to hold my own. You know best
about Castellani's.</said></p>

<p>Tenbury's face darkened. Jack's reference to Cas-
tellani's fencing-rooms went home. Sir Phineas had
had a bout at foils with the young squire, and through
underrating the skill of his opponent had had his
guard broken down and suffered <q>a palpable hit.</q></p>

<p><said>If you gentlemen desire to quarrel, I'd better leave
you to it,</said> interposed Lady Barbara pettishly.</p>

<p><said>There's no necessity. I don't quarrel before
ladies,</said> said Sir Phineas with a sweeping bow. <said>If <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Ralstone has any grievance against me, or imagines I
have affronted——</said></p>

<p><said>There's no imagination,</said> put in Jack quickly. <said>It's
a question of fact. But, like you, I shouldn't think of
wrangling before ladies, and, least of all, in the presence
of Lady Barbara Dacre. If I want you, sir, I know
perfectly well where to find you.</said></p>

<p>The altercation was overpowered by the orchestra
striking up, and the M.C.s hurried hither and thither
on the look-out for partners for disconsolate <soCalled>wall-
<pb n="38"/>
flowers.</soCalled> At the sound of the music, a melody in a
sort of swinging see-saw measure, Sir Phineas turned to
Lady Barbara and offered her his arm.</p>

<p><said>Our waltz. You promised it to me, you <choice><corr>remember</corr><orig>remenber</orig></choice>.
I'm longing for the pleasure. There's nothing to detain
you, I'm sure.</said></p>

<p><said>No. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone owes me an explanation and an
apology, but both can wait,</said> said the offended beauty
coldly.</p>

<p><said>Oh, you shall have the first and the second, too,
if need be,</said> retorted Jack, whose rage was rapidly
mounting to a white heat.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara shot him an angry glance. turned on
her heel, and Sir Phineas bore her away triumphantly.</p>

<p>Ralstone stood for a minute or so quivering with
passion. The sight of his betrothed clinging to Sir
Phineas and being whirled about by him rapturously in
the much-discussed German waltz, was not to be
endured. Though the waltz had been naturalised in
England for ten years, it was still looked upon with
horror by strait-laced people. Byron satirised it with
no effect. The feminine rulers of <choice><corr>Almack's</corr><orig>Almacks</orig></choice>, headed by
Lady Jersey, favoured it; the <soCalled>fashionables,</soCalled> male
and female, devoted their mornings to whirling a chair
about the room to learn the step and measure, and
Sheridan's quatrain:
<q><lg>
<l>In such pure postures our first parents moved,</l>
<l>While hand in hand thro' Eden's bower they roved,</l>
<l>Ere <choice><corr>Beelzebub</corr><orig>Beezebub</orig></choice>, with meaning foul and false</l>
<l>Turned their poor heads and taught them how to waltz</l>
</lg></q>
was quoted everywhere with much relish.</p>

<p>But to see Tenbury's arm round Lady Barbara's
waist—a thing not permitted in any other dance, not
even in a quadrille, where the arms were decorously
crossed in turning, was for Jack Ralstone an intolerable
torture. He rushed to the ante-room, threw down
domino and mask, and rewarding the attendant with a
generous <soCalled>vail,</soCalled> fled from the building, doubtful
whether the first step to relieve his outraged feelings
<pb n="39"/>
should be breaking off his engagement with Lady
Barbara, or sending a challenge to Sir Phineas.</p>

<p>He walked quickly to the <q>Angel and Sun,</q> ordered
out his horse, and stormed at Ostler Joe for no particular
reason other than to let off the steam, and partook of a
stirrup-cup.</p>

<p><said>If you go on backing Tom Spring, Squire,</said>
whispered the landlord, <said>you'll be landed heavily.
There be two or three parties just coom fro' Lunnon by
the mail, an' they be nuts on Spring. Now's your
chance for hedging. Have a bit on Neate.</said></p>

<p><said>To the devil with hedging and Neate too,</said> growled
Jack.</p>

<p>And flinging down his coin for the stirrup-cup—hot
brandy and water, with plenty of the first—he strode
into the cool night air, vaulted into the saddle, and,
forgetful of Stephen's advice not to use the whip, gave
Black Ivory a slash across the flanks, the effect of which
was to send the horse off at a bolt. Luckily the road
was clear, and Jack did not attempt to stop his insulted
steed. The animal went at the top of his form for
quite a couple of miles before he cooled down.</p>

<p>Like all young men of fortune. Jack had his body-
servant. Purvis, his man, was sitting up, though it
was past midnight. He heard his master stable the
horse, and wondered what sort of mood Master Jack
was in.</p>

<p><said>If he's as crusty as the old squire, I'll have an ugly
time.</said></p>

<p>And the fore-boding was likely to prove true, to judge
by Jack's clouded brow and flushed face. But the
young squire said very little. The fact was he was dog-
tired. His strained muscles and sinews were begin-
ning to feel the effect of the bruiser's blows; he had had
a fair amount of drink, and the amazing series of
vexations of which he had been the victim had depressed
his spirits terribly. Hardly had he thrown himself into
bed than he was fast asleep.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sir Phineas was <q>making the running,</q> to
use his own phrase, with Lady Barbara Dacre. She
knew his reputation quite well, but this did not alarm
her. She was born to attract men, and <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="roman">roué</foreign> or innocent
made no difference. Sir Phineas Tenbury's mode of
love-making flattered her, and flattery was to her
second nature.</p>

<p>After the waltz which had so excited Jack Ralstone's
ire, they retired to one of the ante-rooms for refresh-
ment. Sir Phineas ordered champagne. They were on
a settee which held the two comfortably. As if by
chance, the baronet's arm fell behind her. It crept
round her waist. She shifted her position, but there
was not room to escape. She rarely forgot she was a
duke's daughter, and Sir Phineas's sudden familiarity
touched her pride.</p>

<p><said>I'm afraid, sir, you imagine I'm a milkmaid,</said> said
she haughtily.</p>

<p><said>Indeed, I've no such impression,</said> he rejoined, not
a bit abashed. <said>No milkmaid ever had your grace,
your bewitching smile, your musical voice. Is it my
arm that offends you? You did not object while we
were waltzing. Why should you do so now that we
are sitting? But I want to please you, Lady Barbara.
There!</said></p>

<p>He removed his arm, and her disengaged hand—the
other was busy with her fan—was swiftly imprisoned
in his. She would have drawn it away, but he held it
too firmly. An altercation was impossible with so many
people about, and she had to submit.</p>

<p>She was not really angry, though she put on the
pretence of being so. His masterful self-assertion was
not unpleasant. Besides, she was rather curious to
see how far his impudence would take him. He noticed
with a covert smile how skilfully she hid the locked
hands with a movement of her fan.</p>

<pb n="41"/>
<p><said>I think you're very presumptuous.</said></p>

<p><said>Possibly, but not, I hope, rude. Really, one would
think you'd never had a lover, whereas a man of any
sense could hardly look into your eyes and not lose
himself in their depths.</said></p>

<p><said>Is that meant to be poetic?</said></p>

<p><said>It's meant to be the truth.</said></p>

<p><said>It sounds like a quotation from a fashionable
novel.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, it isn't. I never read the trash.</said></p>

<p><said>Not even Sir Walter Scott?</said></p>

<p><said>Not even Scott, though I'm told he's quite the rage.
But, Lady Barbara, surely we didn't come here to talk
about novels?</said></p>

<p><said>What else should we talk about? It's very
interesting.</said></p>

<p><said>Is it the only subject you find interesting when you
and young <choice><corr>Ralstone</corr><orig>Ralston</orig></choice> are together?</said></p>

<p><said>I beg you not to introduce <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone's name into
our conversation.</said></p>

<p><said>By all means. So laggard a lover can well be left
out of our reckoning. I'll wager he doesn't often
discuss the question of love. That's the difference
between us.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't care what the difference is,</said> she retorted
with rising anger. <said>I told you not to mention his
name.</said></p>

<p><said>And I haven't. I speak only in generalities. Ah,
Lady Barbara, if you only knew——</said></p>

<p><said>Knew what?</said></p>

<p><said>How beautiful you are when you're put out. Your
eyes have never sparkled as they do now—at least, I've
never seen them. And your cheeks! I know a score
of Court beauties who'd give their finger-tips to have
your roses.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara burst into a fit of laughter. Her anger
had melted before the fire of compliments.</p>

<p><said>You're too extravagant,</said> said she. <said>Hadn't we
better go back? I can hear another waltz beginning.</said></p>

<p><said>Enchanted,</said> he murmured, and, relinquishing her
hand after a tender pressure, he led her to the ball-room.
<pb n="42"/>
The waltz was followed by another and another. Lady
Barbara had the names of one or two other partners on
her programme, but she ignored them, and Tenbury's
fire-eating disposition and his prowess as a duellist were
so well known that not one of the men to whom her
ladyship had given promises dared dispute his right.</p>

<p>All the same, the young lady's pronounced preference
for the baronet was the subject of comment, and the
dowagers and chaperons were quite scandalised.</p>

<p>After the midnight supper the gaiety waxed fast and
furious, hut it was kept within decent bounds by the
vigilant M.C.s. Bath gaiety, even with all the licence
of a masquerade, had nothing in it akin to the boist-
erousness of a London <q><foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="roman">bal masqué,</foreign></q> as such functions
were beginning to be called.</p>

<p>The hour came for Sir Phineas to see Lady Barbara
to her chair. By this time he had established his
footing. Her ladyship had confided to him that she
would be in town in a fortnight or so, and then they
could meet often.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Tenbury had a way with women which
they found it difficult to resist. During the exciting
moments of the dance he never lost an opportunity of
darting into her eyes a glance of passion. Lady Bar-
bara's brain was bewildered and her nerves tingled
with sensations quite new to her.</p>

<p>Hitherto she had met no man who had gone beyond
the sentimental philandering which then passed current
for flirtation. If the age was not quite so artificially
emotional as some ten or fifteen years before, when
women, and men too, could weep on the slightest
provocation, the fashionable part of the world was still
fairly portrayed by the <soCalled>high life</soCalled> novelist of the
period. In reality, her ladyship was not in the least
bit sentimental, but she accepted sentimentality, and
underneath her coldness she had an ardent tempera-
ment which had never been stirred until this eventful
evening, and she listened, as Sir Phineas could see quite
well, with secret pleasure to his half-veiled protestations
of love.</p>

<pb n="43"/>

<p><said>This has been a never-to-be-forgotten night,</said> her
cavalier whispered, as he conducted her through the
vestibule to the entrance, where the chairmen were
awaiting her. <said>I swear that you've captured me.
I shall be all impatience until we meet again.</said></p>

<p><said>Doubtless that's what you say to every lady,</said> she
returned with a swimming glance, followed by a swift
drooping of the long silky lashes, which rested for a
brief space on her flushed face. Her bosom heaved, a
gentle sigh escaped her, and she returned the ardent
clasp of his hand.</p>

<p><said>No, indeed, by Jupiter. I'm sick of the simpering,
dressed-up, painted women of fashion. You are so
different.</said></p>

<p>She made no answer and she stepped into the sedan,
the door of which Sir Phineas closed. He stood at the
window uttering soft farewells, while the chairmen at
their posts waited for his signal. She put out her hand,
and Sir Phineas pressed it to his lips. Then he remained
bareheaded. The chairmen raised their burden; she
leaned forward and darted a look at him, which revealed
the warmth of her nature more truly than any expression
he had yet seen in her eyes.</p>

<p>The baronet did not quit the entrance steps until the
sedan was out of sight. Then a triumphant smile lit
up his somewhat saturnine face.</p>

<p><said>Faith! An easy conquest. A glorious creature—
handsome enough to warm and tempt St. Anthony.
But——</said></p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><said>She'll do <foreign xml:lang="fr">pour passer le temps</foreign>, while awaiting a
more precious prize. Blue eyes—yes, they sparkle, but
nothing more. They've no mystery behind them, and
what is woman if not mysterious? Some cold-blooded
fellows look for placidity, and what they call comfort—
benighted idiots—men of flesh and blood prefer a plunge
into the unknown. Still, Lady Barbara isn't without
her charm. There's that young fool Ralstone. To cut
him out gives just the spice to the game, without which
it would be as tame as an egg without salt.</said></p>

<pb n="44"/>

<p>He wheeled round and walked meditatingly to the
ante-room, put on his long riding-coat and departed.</p>

<p>There was no moon, but the clear sky was studded
with stars.</p>

<p><said>Contrasts are everything in this insipid old world,</said>
he muttered. <said>I'd like to see how a pair of black eyes
can flash, and, by Heaven, they <emph>will</emph> flash when I present
myself. Passion in her voice, but no tears in her eyes,
I swear. I'd like to make 'em come. Maybe they will.
Why not bring off the <foreign xml:lang="fr">coup</foreign> to-night. I'm in my native
air. It always nerves me. Yes, I'll do it.</said></p>

<p>He strode to the hotel where he had put up his
curricle, and rang the bell until a sleepy boots slowly
opened the door.</p>

<p><said>Stir your stumps, you rascal,</said> growled Sir Phineas,
<said>unless you want a clout of the ear to quicken your
laziness. What the devil do you mean by locking,
bolting and barring me? Didn't the landlord tell you
I might be here any hour between midnight and break-
fast?</said></p>

<p><said>Aye, your honour, but——</said></p>

<p><said>That'll do. Don't waste your excuses, you'll want
'em for somebody else. Rouse the ostler. I want my
curricle at the door in five minutes. D'ye hear? Stay—
bring me a brandy first.</said></p>

<p>The man scuffled away. He met the landlord, who,
hearing the imperious summons, had huddled on a few
garments. The landlord fetched the brandy, and, full,
of apologies, hastened with it to the impatient Sir
Phineas.</p>

<p><said>Will your honour walk into the coffee-room? It's
more comfortable there and——</said></p>

<p><said>Comfort be hanged. Is that scoundrel of an ostler
of yours getting out my curricle?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, Sir Phineas. I've told boots to wake him
up.</said></p>

<p>Tenbury swallowed half the brandy at a gulp. The
landlord watched him with anxiety. One never knew
what dare-devilry Sir Phineas might be up to. His
youth was a long record of escapades, as the villages
between Bath and Bristol well remembered. The
<pb n="45"/>
brandy, however, had apparently restored his good
humour. Emptying his glass, he threw it behind him
and inquired what was the latest news of the fight
between Neate and Spring.</p>

<p><said>I do hear the place be settled. A bagman tells me
Tom Belcher be staying at the <q>Angel and Sun.</q> He
saw Tom this very night, and heard him say as <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Jackson had picked out a likely spot in Hampshire
between Weyhill an' Andover. But it be all under the
rose.</said></p>

<p><said>Of course. And the day?</said></p>

<p><said>Ah, that be more'n I can tell, but I'll bet a guinea
it bean't fur off. Can't keep them things dark fur long.
The say Lunnon's gone pretty nigh mad. I know fur
sartain as Bristol an' round about has. To-morrow
them as be in the know'll be crowding into Andover,
and in less than no time theer won't be a bed to be had
for love or money.</said></p>

<p><said>Is that so? Another brandy landlord, to drink
good luck to Bill Neate.</said></p>

<p>Before the drink was brought the ostler appeared
with the curricle, leading the horse, a wiry, strong mare
and a magnificent trotter that had won many matches
and put hundreds of guineas into his owner's pocket.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas jumped into the vehicle, tossed down the
brandy, and dropped some money into the landlord's
hand. Then, gathering up the reins, he set off at
a smart pace in the direction of the upper road to
Bristol.</p>

<p>The mare was fresh and needed no whip. In less
than half an hour she was a good way towards Bristol,
and Sir Phineas guided her into a by-road some few
yards beyond the second turnpike. This road led to
the Den, a hunting-box belonging to the baronet, and
the remnant of a large estate which had been left him
by his father, and the greater part of which he bad
been forced to sell to pay his gambling debts. Even
the Den was mortgaged. It was situated in a wood
surrounded by a ring fence, and the pleasure-garden
encircling the building, as well as the building itself,
had been utterly neglected, Sir Phineas contending that
<pb n="46"/>
it was absurd to spend money for the benefit of other
people, the mortgagees having long ago threatened to
foreclose.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas had to alight to force open the lodge gate.
The lodge itself was uninhabitable, and had it not been
so the owner would not have gone to the expense of a
lodge-keeper for a place which he only used for a few
weeks in the year.</p>

<p>The bracken, the brambles, and the undergrowth of
the wood generally, had invaded the narrow roadway,
and Sir Phineas, leading the mare, had to struggle
through the dense vegetation. A light in the distance,
showing now and again where there was an opening in
the trees, guided him.</p>

<p>He reached the house, a square building with a gable
roof and a porch in front of the door. He knocked
loudly with the handle of his whip.</p>

<p>A man opened the door and bowed low when he
recognised the visitor.</p>

<p><said>Glad you're about, Brownlow. I'm in the devil of
a hurry. Where's Tim Goadby?</said></p>

<p><said>He's in the kitchen, Sir Phineas. We were having
a hand at cards. I'll call him.</said></p>

<p><said>You needn't. The kitchen will do well enough for
the orders I want to give him.</said></p>

<p>The house was divided by a passage, which ran from
back to front. At the end was the kitchen, a brick-
paved apartment, with a low-ceiling and latticed
windows. A wood fire was burning on the hearth, and
a thick-set man, with a forbidding face, who was sit-
ting at the table, rose at the entrance of Sir Phineas
and touched the roots of his closely-cropped greyish
hair.</p>

<p><said>Get the hooded gig out and put the mare from the
curricle in the shafts. I want you to go a journey with
me. Sharp's the word.</said></p>

<p>Goadby rushed away, and Sir Phineas, turning to
Brownlow, who was standing in an obsequious attitude,
said abruptly:</p>

<p><said>While I'm gone with Tim, make the best bedroom
fit to receive a lady. Light a big fire and air the bed-
<pb n="47"/>
clothes. If there's anything you think of to give the
place a look of comfort, do it.</said></p>

<p>Brownlow, who was Sir Phineas's manservant, had
taken part in too many of his master's Don Juan-like
exploits, showed no surprise, but disappeared to execute
his orders.</p>

<p>The clatter of the mare's hoofs and the grating of
wheels announced that Goadby was busy. In a few
minutes he entered and said all was ready.</p>

<p>Without a word Sir Phineas climbed into the gig,
a clumsy, capacious affair, and Goadby led the mare to
the lodge gate and then climbed into the seat by the
side of his master, who took the reins.</p>

<p>Once more on the high road to Bristol, and at the
common where Jack Ralstone had distinguished him-
self as a knight-errant, the gig halted and Sir Phineas
threw the reins to Goadby.</p>

<p><said>Be on the look-out for my signal, Tim. I shall
whistle. We may probably go back with a lady
passenger,</said> said he grimly.</p>

<p>He strode across the common towards a flickering
glimmer. A gipsy's tent and caravan behind disclosed
itself as he drew near. He did not announce his
presence, but put his head inside the opening of the
tent. The shrill shriek of an old woman greeted him.</p>

<p>The woman had started from her squatting position,
where she had been watching the boiling of a pot and
smoking awhile. A man in the gloom beyond, lying
on a bed of dried bracken, never moved. He was
snoring heavily.</p>

<p><said>Mercy on me, master, how 'ee frightened me. I
took 'ee for your ghost.</said></p>

<p><said>I haven't come to that yet, dame. What news?
Is all well?</said></p>

<p><said>Noa. It be ill—very ill—the worsest as could
happen. I dunno how to tell 'ee.</said></p>

<p><said>Eh?</said> thundered Sir Phineas, <said>what's amiss?
Is the girl.&#x2026; has she carried out her threat?</said></p>

<p><said>To make away wi' herself? No—not so bad as
that.</said></p>

<p><said>What then?</said></p>

<pb n="48"/>
<p><said>She's gone. Runned away.</said></p>

<p><said>Run away! And you and Jerry let her go! You
infernal blunderers. I've a mind to take it out o' your
hides,</said> he roared, his face black with passion.</p>

<p>He strode across the tent, and kicked the sleeping
man savagely. The fellow awoke, started, and struggled
with difficulty into a sitting position.</p>

<p><said>Who the——</said> he was beginning, rubbing his bleary
eyes, when he recognised Sir Phineas. <said>Oh, lor—your
honour——</said> he mumbled.</p>

<p><said>Get up, you lazy brute,</said> stormed the baronet.
<said>What the devil do you mean by disobeying my orders.
Where's the girl?</said></p>

<p><said>Ain't th' old woman told you, sir? We both on us
did our best, and we didn't disobey no orders. I had a
stiff set to wi' the chap as rode away wi' the wench.
He knowed how to use his maulers if ever a man did.
I haven't had such a basting about the ribs since I run
a boxing booth. Dang me if I can move wi'out feeling
a lot o' knives digging into me. Mother, tell his honour
all about it.</said></p>

<p>Tenbury was not so blinded with passion as to be
unable to see that the man had been badly knocked
about, and he turned to the old woman for an explana-
tion. She entered into a long-winded narrative, in the
course of which she put her own conduct and that of
her son, Jerry Winch, in the most favourable light.</p>

<p><said>Mike Croucher was doin' a bit o' shootin' at the
rabbits on the common, an' I shouted to him. He let
fly twice at the gemman and the gal, but I dunno if
any shot hit 'em. <emph>I</emph> never saw a hoss tear along as
that theer hoss did.</said></p>

<p><said>Who was the man who fought Jerry, and carried
her off?</said> demanded Sir Phineas.</p>

<p><said>I dunno him, but Mike Croucher says it wur young
Squire Jack Ralstone.</said></p>

<p><said>Damn Squire Jack Ralstone!</said></p>

<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="5">V</num></head>
<head type="main">Jack Kicks Over the Traces</head>

<p>Young Squire Ralstone indulged in an extra hour or so
in bed the next morning. His thirty mile ride, his mill-
ing exercise, his potations, and his series of disappoint-
ments had left him stiff and off colour. Old Squire
Halstead, on the contrary, rose early in spite of strong
ale, port, rum, and curaçao, and after a hearty break-
fast strolled round the kennels and the stables, chatted
with Stephen, and cursed roundly everything which did
not quite please him. Had he seen the blown and
muddy condition of Black Ivory when the horse was led
into his stall in the small hours of that morning, he
would have flown into a towering passion. But old
Stephen was wary. He had risen betimes, rubbed down
the hunter, and the animal looked much the same.</p>

<p>On his return to the house Simon grumbled vastly at
finding his stepson still in bed. Now that he was sober
he was anxious to make up his quarrel with Jack,
especially as a letter had arrived by a mounted messen-
ger from the Duke of Endsleigh. His Grace wrote he
saw no reason why the marriage of Lady Barbara and
Jack Ralstone should be further delayed, and suggested
that arrangements should at once he made for their
nuptials.</p>

<p><q>Chudleigh, the member for Pocketon Magna wants
to retire,</q> added the Duke. <q>I've but to give the
word, and he will apply for the Chiltern Hundreds, the
seat will be vacant, and as the borough is practically
mine, young Ralstone may consider himself already an
M.P. I shall see about securing him a post, which will
in time assure him a baronetcy.</q></p>

<p>Simon snapped his fingers, and his hard, coarse face
brightened. He rang the bell, and ordered a tankard
of cider, his favourite morning drink, to mark the
occasion.</p>

<p><said>An' look 'ee here, Robert, knock at Master Jack's
<pb n="50"/>
door, and tell him to stir his stumps. Say as I've got
some good news for him.</said></p>

<p><q>John Ralstone, Esq., M.P.—dash my wig if it don't
sound well. It 'ud be better if it was John Halstead.
Can't be helped. What is, is.</q></p>

<p>He walked up and down the room, his hands deep in
his capacious breeches pockets, and muttering to him-
self:</p>

<p><said>Thirty thousand guineas—that's what I've pro-
mised the Duke the day Jack marries Lady Barbara.
It'll make a hole in my fortune, but what o' that? The
Barbados plantation's worth double if so be as I want
to sell it. If I don't it'll go to Jack's son if he gets
one. Seein' as how it cost me next to nothing I oughtn't
to grumble. They say as ill come by ill comes. Do
it? Not wi' Simon Halstead. Never had a stroke o'
bad luck in my life, an' I'm too old to begin at that
game now. He-he-he!</said></p>

<p>Simon was laughing his grating, shrill laugh when the
door opened, and in walked Jack Ralstone.</p>

<p><said>Well, you graceless dog! What have 'ee got to
say for yourself, eh? Going down on your marrow
bones to say you're sorry for rubbing me the wrong way
yesterday?</said></p>

<p>Simon's manner was bullying, and his voice loud, but
it was all put on.</p>

<p><said>Here—your fist, lad. Shake hands. Let bygones
be bygones.</said></p>

<p>Jack couldn't refuse. Besides he did not wish to do
so. He had no reason for quarrelling with his step-
father. His anger, too, had passed away. He held
out his hand.</p>

<p><said>Ye don't look in over good fettle,</said> said Simon, after
a keen glance at Jack's face. <said>What were 'ee up to
last night? Where did 'ee get that black peeper?</said></p>

<p><said>Had words with a chap on the Bath Road. He
insulted me, so I went for him.</said></p>

<p><said>An' he went for 'ee seemingly. Who was best
man?</said></p>

<p><said>I left him like a dead dog.</said></p>

<pb n="51"/>

<p><said>No, did 'ee now. That's fine. Did 'ee give him
that knock down blow I taught 'ee?</said></p>

<p>Jack couldn't remember any particular blow belong-
ing exclusively to Simon. If he had it had been driven
out of his mind by what he had learned from Tom
Spring and <soCalled>Gentleman</soCalled> Jackson, but he did not care
to say so. He nodded, and sat down in front of a huge
home-cured ham, carving himself a mighty slice.</p>

<p><said>Did Robert tell 'ee I'd got some good news for
'ee?</said> went on the Squire after he had allowed Jack to
eat in peace for some few minutes.</p>

<p><said>Yes, sir, he said something of the kind. What is
it?</said></p>

<p><said>I've had a letter from the Duke. He's as friendly
as may be. Starts wi' <q>My dear Halstead,</q>—that's
pretty good from a nobleman of his high rank,
eh?</said></p>

<p><said>Very good, indeed, sir,</said> said Jack, and put back on
his plate the mouthful he was about to swallow. The
Duke was the last person he was anxious to discuss. It
brought to his remembrance his annoying meeting with
Lady Barbara, and the direct snub he had received at
her hands. Also Sir Phineas Tenbury, and the score
he meant some day to settle with the baronet.</p>

<p><said>How are 'ee getting on wi' your courting? Billing
and cooing as sweethearts should?</said></p>

<p><said>Not much of that, sir.</said></p>

<p><said>An' why the devil not? When I was your age I
didn't let the grass grow under my feet when a wench
was concerned.</said></p>

<p><said>I dare say not. I can't fancy billing and cooing
with Lady Barbara.</said></p>

<p><said>The devil you can't. Lady Barbara's as fine a lady
as ever stepped. Now, if I don't make a mistake, she's
just that sort as likes bein' fussed over. It only wants
pluck. Tender handed stroke a nettle and it stings
you for your pains. Grasp it like a man of mettle, and
it soft as silk remains. 'Tis the same wi' a woman.</said></p>

<p><said>Maybe. Anyhow, it doesn't look as if there was
going to be any grasping in this case. The fact is, Lady
Barbara and I have fallen out.</said></p>

<pb n="52"/>

<p><said>What? Fallen out wi' a duke's <choice><corr>daughter</corr><orig>daugter</orig></choice>? I'm
damned.</said></p>

<p>Simon's manner changed. His face grew very red,
and he seemed to swell out like a ruffled turkey cock.</p>

<p><said>Fallen out, have ye? An' what over?</said></p>

<p><said>Nothing in particular—excepting that for a lady she
was exceedingly rude.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, was she. An' what about you? I'll warrant
it were six o' one, an' half a dozen o' the other. That's
nothing between sweethearts. You'll kiss and make it
up afore many hours are over, and then you'll be deeper
in love than ever.</said></p>

<p><said>I think not, sir. I'm not in love with Lady Barbara
—never was in love with her, and I doubt if I ever shall
be.</said></p>

<p><said>What does that mean, you blockhead? Bean't
you going to marry her?</said></p>

<p><said>If you like to put it that way, no.</said></p>

<p>The Squire gasped for breath. He was speechless.
His red face became purple, with here and there a yellow
patch. The slaves on his plantation trembled when
they saw him look like this. It was a prelude to savage
flogging, to merciless torture. With a tremendous effort
he restrained his rage. In a cold, constrained tone he
said:</p>

<p><said>It's you who put it. Let us two understand each
other. Say straight out what's in your mind. D'ye
mean to marry Lady Barbara Dacre, or don't 'ee?</said></p>

<p><said>Well then, as matters stand, I don't.</said></p>

<p><said>Damn! What am I to say to the Duke? How
am I to answer this?</said></p>

<p>Simon brought his sledge hammer fist down on the
letter lying on the table, with a force that made the
crockery rattle.</p>

<p>The dregs of Jack's bad temper of the previous even-
ing were stirred up.</p>

<p><said>Answer it as you like, sir. It's your business, not
mine. <emph>I</emph> never asked the Duke for permission to court
his daughter. You did it all.</said></p>

<p>The floodgates of Simon's wrath were opened. The
extensive vocabulary of ship-board obscenity, of slave
<pb n="53"/>
galley and sugar plantations brutal abuse, was called
upon. Simon Halstead had no lack of vulgar and blas-
phemous epithets at his command to express his rage
and disgust. Jack was horrified at the old man's out-
pourings. He had heard vague hints of Simon Hals-
tead's strange experiences, but he never imagined his
<choice><reg>stepfather</reg><orig>step-father</orig></choice> could be so debased.</p>

<p><said>I'd better leave you, sir, to talk to yourself. I
don't see I've anything to reply to,</said> said he, springing
to his feet.</p>

<p><said>Stop! Where are 'ee going?</said> thundered the
Squire.</p>

<p><said>I don't quite know. Anyhow, I'm not inclined to
stop in this house much longer.</said></p>

<p><said>Go and be damned. Don't 'ee darken my doors
again. I've done wi' you.</said></p>

<p><said>By all means. I hope I can look after myself.</said></p>

<p><said>Can ye? You'll tell another story afore long. You
won't be able to live the fine, easy life of a gentleman.
You haven't been denied anything you had a fancy for.
I've paid your debts, and you've never wanted for
money. That's all over. Your allowance from this
minute stops. I'll write to-day to Fauntleroy's Bank
to close the account I opened for you there, and to
transfer the balance to mine. Go and earn your own
living.</said></p>

<p><said>That's what I mean to do. Thank you for what
you've done for me, and good day.</said></p>

<p>How Jack controlled his own hasty temper was a
mystery to him. With a bow, the politeness of which
exasperated Simon beyond endurance, he walked to the
door, deaf to the execrations hurled after him.</p>

<p>He went up to his room. His man was brushing and
putting away his clothes.</p>

<p><said>Purvis,</said> said he, <said>the Squire and I have had a fall-
out, and it'll be many a long day before we're friends.
Perhaps never. I don't see how I can keep you any
longer in my service. You'll want your wages, and
where the money's coming from isn't quite clear.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm very sorry, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jack,</said> said the man, pulling
a long face. <said>I looked forward to being with you for
<pb n="54"/>
many a year, sir. What'll you do wi'out anybody to
look after you, sir?</said></p>

<p><said>Look after myself, of course. You'll have no
difficulty in getting a good place. I shall speak for
you.</said></p>

<p><said>I know that, sir, but—begging your pardon, sir,
I'd like to ask whether I mightn't stay till you're used
to looking after yourself.</said></p>

<p><said>You noodle. What's the good of that?</said> laughed
Jack. <said>While you're with me, d'you think I'll lift a
finger? It won't do.</said></p>

<p>But Purvis pleaded so hard, and looked so disap-
pointed that Jack was talked into trying the experi-
ment.</p>

<p><said>It needn't be sudden death to-day, need it, sir. I'll
just go on as before. What would you like me to do?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, pack up all my belongings, and don't for
Heaven's sake forget my boxing gloves, my foils, pistols,
and the Joe Manton I bought the last time I was in
London. It's the best sporting gun to be had for love
or money.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, sir.</said></p>

<p>Jack's programme of looking after himself was to
sink back in a chair, light a cigar, and think over
things, while Purvis moved noiselessly about the room
packing up.</p>

<p>What was to be his next step? He went over his
cash. Twenty guineas or so represented his stock of
money. He had laid out bets by which, if Tom Spring
pulled off the fight, he would win £500. Should Tom
fail, he would owe £2,500—debts of honour which he
was bound to pay—if he could. But how? He had
not a penny in the world. His twenty guineas would
not last long.</p>

<p><said aloud="false">I've a mind to go on plunging,</said> he soliloquised.
<said aloud="false">In for a penny in for a pound—may as well be hung
for a sheep as a lamb. There's comfort in those musty
old proverbs. I won't think about those that give the
direct lie to these scraps of wisdom—penny wise, pound
foolish—look before you leap, and the rest of 'em.</said></p>

<p><said>How long will it take you to pack, Purvis?</said> said he.</p>

<pb n="55"/>

<p><said>About an hour, sir.</said></p>

<p><said>Good. I'll stroll over to the <q>Dragon</q> and see
about a post chaise.</said></p>

<p>And leaving Purvis to his work, Jack sauntered out
of the room and jauntily descended the staircase, as
though he had not a care in the world. He did not want
encounter the Squire and did not leave the house by
the main entrance.</p>

<p>The <q>Dragon</q> was a posting house about ten minutes
walk, and Jack, who was well known to the landlord,
was heartily welcomed. There was a subdued air of
excitement about the place, which Jack did not fail to
notice.</p>

<p><said>Any news from London?</said> said he.</p>

<p>The landlord understood what he meant. There
could be only one topic of news from London which
could possibly interest Bristol and its neighbourhood—
the forthcoming prize fight.</p>

<p><said>The day be fixed for the mill,</said> whispered the land-
lord, his finger on his lip. <said>It be the 20th.</said></p>

<p><said>What! In less than a week? By Jupiter, that's
pretty near. Are you sure?</said></p>

<p><said>Sartin sure. The guard of the Bristol mail brought
the news early this mornin' and tells it to I as an old
friend. It bean't known in Lunnon yet. <soCalled>Gentleman</soCalled>
Jackson's knocker'll be goin' nineteen to the dozen afore
many hours be over. Now don't 'ee go an' let it out.
It'll get wind soon enough, and anybody as doesn't get
a bed at Andover in good time'll have to sleep in a
ditch.</said></p>

<p><said>If this news should only be true,</said> said Jack doubt-
fully.</p>

<p><said>I'll take my oath it be.</said></p>

<p><said>All right. Now what about a post chaise to
Andover?</said></p>

<p><said>I might manage it for <emph>you</emph>, Squire. It's a good
eighty miles to Andover and it'll cost 'ee a bit. Not
less than ten guineas; then there's the boys' tips, the
baiting and t'other charges. Can't be done under a
couple o' days.</said></p>

<p><said>No matter. Have the chaise ready at once. I
<pb n="56"/>
want first to go to Bristol and we'll start fair from
there.</said></p>

<p>The thing was settled, and Jack saw he was in a fair
way for spending all his ready money. But he didn't
care. Indeed, the plunge into the unknown rather
suited his mood and he walked back to the Manor
House in high spirits.</p>

<p>He looked in at the stables and found old Stephen
with a very long face.</p>

<p><said>What be amiss, Master Jack, atween you an' the
Squire? He comed down here an hour agone in a
storm o' passion and says I warn't to let 'ee have none
o' the 'osses or dogs.</said></p>

<p><said>The Squire might have saved himself the trouble.
It's good-bye for me to the horses, dogs and rest of the
live stock, including you, Steve.</said></p>

<p><said>Mussy on me. What do it all mean?</said></p>

<p><said>I'm off to seek my fortune. I don't care if I never
see Simon Halstead again. We two've had good times
together, Steve—ratting, otter hunting, fishing and the
rest. I shall think of you when I'm in London.</said></p>

<p><said>Goin' to Lunnon? But you'll be comin' back here
some time?</said></p>

<p><said>I don't think so.</said></p>

<p>Jack held out his hand and Stephen gripped it
heartily.</p>

<p><said>What be 'ee a goin' to do in Lunnon, if I might be
so bold as to ask.</said></p>

<p><said>Haven't the least notion. But if the worst comes
to the worst I can go into the prize ring.</said></p>

<p><said>Eh? Ye'd be among the <soCalled>fancy</soCalled> would 'ee? Not
the trade of a gentleman, I'm thinkin'.</said></p>

<p><said>Why not. What about <soCalled>Gentleman</soCalled> Jackson?
What about John Gully—a Bristol man he was, mind
you, like Tom Cribb. D'you mean to say they're not
gentlemen? Is there a word to be said against the
<soCalled>Game Chicken</soCalled> or Tom Spring? They fought clean
and fair; they never gave in till they were beaten and
they never soiled their lips with the vile words I've
heard <emph>some</emph> gentlemen use.</said></p>

<p>A recollection of Simon Halstead's horrible language
<pb n="57"/>
passed through Jack's mind, but he wasn't going to
bring his stepfather's name into the discussion. Stephen
was not convinced; he shook his head sadly, and Jack
without another word strode out of the stables.</p>

<p>There was nobody else of whom Jack cared to take
leave, and he spent the time until the post chaise arrived
in looking round his rooms to see that Purvis had for-
gotten nothing that he might want. Simon, he learned,
had gone to Bristol to look up some cronies at the docks,
and was doubtless in for a heavy day's drinking. So
much the better, thought Jack, and he set out without
any hindrance.</p>

<p>At Bristol he deposited his luggage in the care of a
friendly innkeeper, and keeping the chaise waiting he
went into a pawnbroker's shop and raised £20 on a
diamond ring. Provided with funds he commenced
the journey to Andover.</p>

</div>


<div n="6" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="6">VI</num></head>
<head type="main"><q>What Have You Done with the Girl?</q></head>

<p>The <q>George</q> at Andover was crammed from floor to
roof. Jack arrived four days before the day fixed,
according to his information, for the fight, and he
thought himself lucky to get a tiny attic for which he
paid a high price. It was anything but palatial, but
this was of no consequence. He only wanted it for its
bed. His days were spent in the <q>George</q> coffee-room,
in the bar parlour, in walks about the country, especially
in the direction of Weyhill.</p>

<p>At the end of the second day—May 17th—he began
to be worried. He could not find out anything definite
beyond that Spring was training at Reigate and Neate
at Marlborough. Still the people kept crowding into
the tame and uninteresting little town, but they were
mostly from the surrounding neighbourhood. Very few
had come from London and it seemed ominous that no
great man concerned in the arrangements—Jackson,
Cribb, or Tom Belcher—had put in an appearance.</p>

<pb n="58"/>

<p>What if after all the spot had again been changed?
Such mishaps are common enough in the history of the
prize ring.</p>

<p>Now that the reaction from the excitement of the
crisis which had suddenly come into his life had set in—
a reaction accentuated by his inactivity and suspense—
the memory of the two women who had been so strangely
<choice><corr>brought</corr><orig>brough</orig></choice> into rivalry came back vividly.</p>

<p>About Lady Barbara he was uncertain. Neither her
temperament nor her beauty, striking though it was,
had ever appealed to him. The first was too haughty
and savoured of inordinate vanity; the second had
an animalism which jarred somewhat on his romantic
spirit.</p>

<p>But the dark-eyed girl—she had possessed him at
first sight—even before she had completely revealed her
face, which had so fascinated him. To his fervid
imagination she had flashed upon him like a dream,
and like a dream she had vanished. There was an
unreality about the adventure which added to its charm.
Would they ever meet again? Fate would indeed be
too cruel if not.</p>

<p>With Monday the 19th came a change over the rest-
less little town, which drove all thought of women out
of his head. The uncertainty and restlessness ceased.
The groups of men with nothing to do but to gossip and
block up what traffic there was in the main street
gathered in a big crowd in front of the <q>George,</q> and
farmers, tradesmen, yokels jostled each other in the
wide passage-way over which the inn was partly built,
and poured into the hotel entrance, eager to learn the
news.</p>

<p>The cause of the pother was a post chaise, with horses
dead beat, their bodies giving out clouds of vapour, and
postboys reeling in their saddles from long hours of
hard riding, which had crawled up to the <q>George.</q>
The occupants—more in number than the chaise would
comfortably hold—descended, stretched their cramped
limbs, stamped their feet, and crowding into the inn
shouted for the landlord. The latter, one Sutton, not
remarkable for urbanity of manners, received them
<pb n="59"/>
civilly enough when he heard that they had travelled
at the devil's own pace from London.</p>

<p>The party wanted rooms for the night. The great
event was to come off positively the next day and the
spot was to be the expected one on the road to Weyhill.
The fiat to this effect had gone forth from Jackson, the
<q>commander of the milling forces,</q> issued at his house
in Pimlico, which all Saturday and Sunday had been
besieged by patrons of the noble art anxious for
information.</p>

<p>Alas for the gentlemen of the post chaise. In spite
of their having brought the important news, they were
too large a party to be accommodated. Sutton was
willing to stretch a point for one, but not for all. The
party declined to be separated. They cursed, they
swore; Sutton lost his temper and almost refused to
serve them with the refreshment they loudly demanded.</p>

<p>However, as the <q>gentlemen from London</q> saw the
wisdom of apologising for their outburst, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sutton
deigned to supply them with rump steaks and strong
ale, and finally the party offered to pay the postboys
liberally for allowing the chaise to be used that night as
a bedchamber, and in comparison with later arrivals
they had a right to consider themselves lucky.</p>

<p>The post chaise was, as the day wore on, followed by
an unceasing stream of vehicles from London and the
towns and villages on the way. The news had spread
like wildfire, and the crowd of pedestrians starting from
London was reinforced on the way down by country
patrons. Spring carts, and carts without springs.
wagons, vans, carriages, post chaises, gigs, curricles,
horsemen, on they came, blocking up the highway at
various points and occasionally involving themselves in
a state of confusion, out of which no amount of sultry
words could extricate them.</p>

<p>By five o'clock in the afternoon not a bed could be
had in Andover. Seething crowds and a jumbled up
mass of vehicles were wedged in the few streets, wide
and narrow. There was not the slightest room to house
the horses; it was difficult to get them provender.
Drivers, riders and passengers were in the same plight.
<pb n="60"/>
Every particle of food was devoured as though a swarm
of locusts had passed over the town. All the neighbour-
ing villages were scoured and they too were cleared of
everything eatable.</p>

<p>Jack enjoyed the bustle, the noise, the excitement,
the growls and the grumbles. He went out into the
street and elbowed his way through the crowd, and
when tired of the pushing, the brawling, the foul
tobacco and the equally foul language, he returned to
the <q>George</q> for what he could get to eat. He had
not much fear he should not be able to satisfy his
appetite, the <q>George</q> taking care to look after those
who were staying in the house.</p>

<p>He went up to his room to wash away the remem-
brances of the greasy, jostling crowd, and was surprised
to find his door opened and a manservant coming out.</p>

<p><said>Hallo, my good fellow, what are you doing in
there? That's my room.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, sir, so I was told, but the landlord has let a
portion of it to my master. He said he was sure you
wouldn't mind.</said></p>

<p><said>Did he? Then he made a huge mistake. I do
mind—very much. I've taken the room and the bed
in it, and I mean to stick to what I've paid for.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I don't think you'll be troubled, sir; my
master is a gentleman.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't care whether he's a gentleman or a vaga-
bond. The room isn't big enough for one, let alone
two, and the bed's so narrow it might be a coffin.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm sure my master has no desire to turn you out
of your bed. I thought of making him up a bed on the
floor.</said></p>

<p><said>Very good of you,</said> retorted Jack, his temper rapidly
rising.</p>

<p>By this time he was in the room and saw a big valise
on the only chair. Without the slightest ceremony he
hauled it off and bade the man take it away.</p>

<p><said>I'm afraid I can't do that, sir, without my master's
orders.</said></p>

<p>The man's words were civil, but his manners were
insolent, and his face was as insolent as his manners.
<pb n="61"/>
A white-faced, sleek-haired fellow, with cunning eyes
and a truculent lip, he had bully and rascal written
upon him unmistakably.</p>

<p><said>And who the devil is your master that he should
give his orders about my room?</said> demanded Jack.</p>

<p><said>Sir Phineas Tenbury, sir. Perhaps you don't know
him.</said></p>

<p><said>I know him sufficiently to treat him as I do his
luggage.</said></p>

<p>With one vigorous kick he sent the valise flying into
the passage.</p>

<p><said>If you don't want to be served the same way, you'd
better take yourself off.</said></p>

<p><said>And what am I to tell my master?</said></p>

<p><said>Tell him what you like.</said></p>

<p>Jack looked so threatening that the fellow retreated
precipitately. Leaving the valise where Jack had
kicked it, he disappeared down the narrow staircase.</p>

<p>Jack slammed to the door and sat down on the little
bed to calm down and to marvel at the irony of fate
which had thrust upon him the company of a man he
detested and with whom so recently he had nearly had
a quarrel. Had Sutton approached him properly, he
would have raised no objection to sharing the room
with any decent person—but not Sir Phineas under any
circumstances. He wondered what would be the out-
come of the incident. Sir Phineas was not the man to
take a rebuff lying down.</p>

<p>He was right. Hardly had two minutes gone by
than there came a sharp tap at the door. Jack was not
disposed to act the lackey to Sir Phineas, so he shouted
<said>Come in.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas was much too fine a gentleman to act as
his own porter. It was his man who knocked at the
door and who opened it at Jack's response. His master
was a couple of paces behind. His lips were white with
passion, and his nostrils quivered. He was about to
burst into a storm of imprecations, when he recognised
Ralstone and his manner changed. He was noted for
his great control over himself and he showed it now.</p>

<pb n="62"/>

<p><said>Oh, this is capital,</said> said he coolly. <said>It's as good
a piece of comedy as Liston ever played in.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm glad you find it so,</said> retorted Jack, as cool as
the other. <said>Your allusion to Liston in a comedy is
extremely happy, with yourself, I presume, as Tony
Lumpkin.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas was not prepared for this keen thrust.
It went home, for at that moment all London was
splitting its sides over Liston and his inimitable Tony
Lumpkin in <q>She Stoops to Conquer,</q> in which at the
beginning of the year he had made his first appearance
at Drury Lane. For the moment Tenbury had nothing
to say in reply. However, he soon recovered himself,
but he had lost his sneer and his bantering tone. He
was now grimly serious.</p>

<p><said>Is it true, sir, that you sent an impudent message
by my servant that you would serve me as you served
that valise?</said></p>

<p><said>Quite true.</said></p>

<p><said>Are you prepared to do it?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes. I am at your service, either with my feet or
my hands. Milling is the fashion. Shall we anticipate
Spring and Neate?</said></p>

<p>Jack Ralstone at the moment looked particularly
aggressive. Sir Phineas ran his eye over the athletic
frame, the picture of muscular manhood. He had
heard from Jerry Winch that <q>the gemman used his
mauleys uncommon well,</q> and Jerry's bruised body was
sufficient proof of the statement. Sir Phineas was, like
most of the <soCalled>bloods</soCalled> of the time, well up in boxing,
but he knew he would not stand the ghost of a chance
with Ralstone.</p>

<p><said>Gentlemen do not settle their differences in that
vulgar fashion,</said> said he, biting his lip.</p>

<p><said>As you please. Any kind of weapon will suit me.</said></p>

<p><said>Is this a challenge?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, if you like to make it so. My friend will wait
upon you as soon as I get to London.</said></p>

<p><said>The sooner the better. But our quarrel, so far as
it has gone, is but a paltry affair. I don't want to be
the laughing stock at Brooks's or Boodle's. It will be
<pb n="63"/>
said that Sir Phineas pinked his man because his valise
was kicked out of an inn bedroom. If we do fight, let
it be over the best cause in the world—a woman.</said></p>

<p><said>What! Bring the name of Lady Barbara Dacre
into this squabble? That doesn't strike me as very
gentlemanly.</said></p>

<p><said>I introduce no name. I'm not thinking of Lady
Barbara, but of somebody quite different.</said></p>

<p><said>Indeed, and who may she be?</said></p>

<p><said>The girl you rode away with on Blankstone
Common, the night of the Bath Masquerade.</said></p>

<p>Tenbury's voice was hard and grating. He snapped
out his words as though he was biting them. His lips
tightened, but did not meet, a thin line of white teeth
showing between.</p>

<p>Jack started and the blood galloped through his veins.
His face crimsoned.</p>

<p><said>I see you remember. What have you done with the
girl?</said> demanded Sir Phineas with a burst of passion,
his boasted self-control suddenly breaking down.</p>

<p><said>I decline to tell you. It's no affair of yours,</said>
returned Jack coldly.</p>

<p><said>I make it mine. You interfered in what didn't
concern you and you shall pay for it.</said></p>

<p><said>I always pay my debts, Sir Phineas. I don't intend
to follow your example.</said></p>

<p>Another hit. Sir Phineas could always find money
for something discreditable, if it ministered to his
pleasure, but his legitimate debts he ignored, as many
a tradesman knew to his cost.</p>

<p><said>See here, Ralstone. We needn't bandy repartees.
The point is this. The girl you laid hands upon is
mine, and neither you nor any other man shall have
her. I await the coming of your friend. Lord
Houston will act for me.</said></p>

<p>Wheeling round, he stalked away, leaving Jack in a
mingled state of bewilderment and exhilaration. The
prospect of a fight, even with so notorious a duellist as
Tenbury, did not frighten him, and he had a curious
sense of pleasure that the fight was to be over the dark-
eyed girl whom he had found so fascinating, and about
<pb n="64"/>
whom he had woven quite a web of romance, though
there was no occasion for weaving, so far as he was
concerned, for the circumstances in themselves were
romantic enough.</p>

<p>But that which puzzled him not a little was the
relationship between her and Tenbury. All he could
decide was the certainty he could render her no better
service than free her from the clutches of so callous a
woman pursuer as Sir Phineas. It was a great comfort
to him to think that she was at that moment out of the
baronet's hands.</p>

<p><said>The fellow, I expect'll choose pistols. They say he
can pip the ace of hearts fourteen times out of fifteen
at twenty paces. Not a pleasant prospect for me, but
hang it, I'll take my chance.</said></p>

<p>He saw no more of Sir Phineas. He noticed the
valise was gone, and this in itself was a triumph. Sutton
was very grumpy over the affair, representing that the
young man might have stretched a point to so good a
patron of sport as Sir Phineas Tenbury. Jack did not
enter into particulars, but laughed the matter down,
and suggested that if the landlord was aggrieved he'd
spring another guinea. This lordly way of settling
things <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sutton found perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p>The night passed amid a perfect uproar outside.
Jack might as well have been in the street. The
drunken shouts, the brawls, the impromptu <soCalled>mills,</soCalled> the
tramping horses, made sleep almost impossible. Inside
the <q>George</q> things were just as bad, nothing but noisy
talking and laughing, and tramping up and down stairs.
When dawn came he was glad enough to turn out and
await what the day might bring forth.</p>

<p>The buzz and din were still going on, and the excite-
ment grew to fever heat about nine o'clock, when the
two heroes arrived amid stentorian cheers. Jack was
in the bar parlour when Spring entered the <q>George,</q>
and he pressed forward to shake the pugilist by the
hand.</p>

<p><said>By George, Spring, I never saw you look so fit.
Good luck to you. You're sure to win.</said></p>

<p><said>I'll do my level best, sir, not only because of my-
<pb n="65"/>
self, but for the sake of my backers. Are you in at
all heavily, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone?</said> added Tom, sinking his
voice.</p>

<p><said>Well, if <emph>you</emph> win, Tom, I shall land £500 or so but
if you don't I stand to lose £2,500.</said></p>

<p><said>Long odds, sir,</said> said Tom, looking serious. <said>You
Bristol folk seem to fancy Neate, eh?</said></p>

<p><said>Rather. They're all Neate's men excepting myself.
But I've seen you put your mauleys up, and they
haven't. The knowing ones say you can't hit.</said></p>

<p><said>Do they; well, they'll see.</said></p>

<p><said>And that if Bill Neate gets in one of his sledge-
hammer strokes on the mark, you're done for.</said></p>

<p><said><emph>If's</emph> good, sir. He's got to do it. But Cribb's
beckoning me. See you again, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone, at the
ropes. Wait a moment. I'll scribble you a word or
two, and that'll make you sure of a good place. The
ring-keepers know my fist. Got a pencil, sir?</said></p>

<p>Tom wrote something on one of Jack's cards and
handed it to him.</p>

<p><said>Thanks, Tom,</said> cried Ralstone, flushing with pride.
<said>I'll have this framed.</said></p>

<p>Spring smiled and passed on.</p>

<p>It was soon noised about that Weyhill was certainly
the chosen spot, and somehow this did not have the
effect of reducing the chaos reigning in Andover. The
fact was the crowd feared another change, and refused
to budge until they saw the combatants start. Things
looked <choice><corr>perilously</corr><orig>periously</orig></choice> near a riot, and the <q>George</q> was
surrounded by an angry, hungry, swaying multitude of
swells, tradesmen, farmers, and, of course, the great
unwashed. The shopkeepers, in spite of the protection
of the shutters, began to fear a general pillage.</p>

<p>Fortunately <soCalled>Gentleman</soCalled> Jackson was an adept at
getting out of a hot corner. He decided that Hinckley
Downs, a mile or so out of Andover, on the London
Road, would be much better than a three-mile tramp
to Weyhill. It meant a more rapid clearance of the
town, and would intercept the ever-increasing arrivals
from London. Directly it was known that this was a
definite decision, the perspiring mass set off helter-
<pb n="66"/>
skelter along the London Road, heedless of the rain
which about eleven o'clock was pouring in torrents.</p>

<p>The place selected by Jackson was admirable. It
was a big field on a slope at such an angle that the
high ground on two sides of the arena could accom-
modate thousands well able to see the fight over the
heads of those on the level. The approach was a race
for the fleet-footed. Hundreds weary with a long
tramp and sleepless night had but little chance. The
road was soon blocked up by two opposing streams of
vehicles, one from Andover and the other from London.
Yells and imprecations rent the air.</p>

<p><said>Break down the fences,</said> roared some one. There
was a moment of hesitation, and the owners of the
adjoining fields had time to realise the situation, and
gave permission for gaps to be cut in the fences and
hedges, providing they were compensated. The hat
went round, shillings and coppers were collected by the
score, and when the gigs, carts, post-chaises, curricles
and the rest rushed in through the openings, everybody
was satisfied.</p>

<p>The twenty-four-foot ring was in readiness, and
the ring-keepers—sturdy, bronze-faced, broken-nosed
<soCalled>bruisers,</soCalled> most of them ex-members of the P.R.,
armed with whips—took care that no unauthorised
person invaded the sacred spot. The privileged <soCalled>nobs,</soCalled>
patrons of Cribb at his hostelry in Panton Street, Hay-
market, of Tom Belcher at <q>The Castle,</q> of <q>Uncle</q>
Burn at <q>The Rising Sun,</q> Piccadilly, and other ex-
P.R. publicans, were admitted within the ropes, and
Jack Ralstone, thanks to Spring's autograph, was of
the number. Surrounding the ring, the spectators were
seated, some eight or ten deep, hundreds stood behind,
then came jumbled rows of vehicles, and, lastly, the
packed crowd on the crest of the slope. Many women,
quite an unusual thing, were there, all enthusiastic
supporters of the Somersetshire hero. The rain came
down steadily, but no one heeded it. Excitement and
suspense overcame every discomfort.</p>

<p>Jack Ralstone found himself amid a group of <soCalled>bloods</soCalled>
from London, several of whom he knew. Among them
<pb n="67"/>
was young Lord Walsham, who had not long before
come into his majority and a handsome fortune, which
he was doing his best to spend. He and Ralstone were
old 'Varsity chums. They greeted each other warmly.</p>

<p><said>Glad you're here, Walsham,</said> said Jack after a brief
interchange of opinion concerning the event of the
day. <said>I shall want your services when I get back to
town.</said></p>

<p><said>My purse is yours, Ralstone,</said> said his lordship, a
fair-haired, boyish-looking young man, whose fresh
colour had not yet yielded to the effects of gambling
nights and drinking orgies.</p>

<p><said>Thanks, but it's not a question of money. I've a
little affair of honour on hand.</said></p>

<p><said>The deuce you have. Who's the fellow?</said></p>

<p><said>Sir Phineas Tenbury.</said></p>

<p>Lord Walsham's face became very grave.</p>

<p><said>I'd rather it was anybody else. You know what
his reputation is. He's not content with winging his
man. He'd as lief kill outright as not.</said></p>

<p>Jack shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><said>Maybe two can play at that game. Anyhow,
you'll act for me?</said></p>

<p><said>Of course. But I tell you frankly I don't like it.
What's the row over? A woman?</said></p>

<p><said>In a way, yes.</said></p>

<p>Further talk on the matter was impossible on account
of the clamour all around. A hot discussion had sprung
up between the Corinthians round about concerning
the respective merits of Spring and Neate. One voice
dominated the rest.</p>

<p><said>I know what I'm talking about, gentlemen. Spring
hasn't a dog's chance. He's a soft hitter. His hands'll
give out before he's fought a dozen rounds. Everybody
knows he's a <soCalled>light tapper,</soCalled> a <soCalled>china man.</soCalled> One fair
blow from Neate's mighty fist and he'll go silly as an
owl.</said></p>

<p>Jack knew the rasping, sneering voice. It belonged
to Sir Phineas Tenbury.</p>

<p><said>That may be, but he managed all the same to
thrash Jack Carter, Ben Burn, Bob Burn, Josh Hud-
<pb n="68"/>
son, and Tom Oliver,</said> retorted one of Spring's sup-
porters.</p>

<p><said>What about Ned Painter?</said> was Tenbury's reply.</p>

<p><said>Ned's the only man who ever beat him, but when
they fought a second time the tables were turned.</said></p>

<p><said>Painter's not to be compared to Neate. When Bill
comes on with one of his furious rushes, it's like a bull
charging. Anyhow, I'm backing Neate. Anybody
on?</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas was looking straight at Ralstone, as
though challenging him. Certainly, this was how Jack
interpreted his glance. An uncontrollable spirit of
defiance and recklessness seized him. He had but a
few guineas in his pocket, he hadn't the least idea where
money was to come from if Spring failed him, and if so,
he would be involved in debts of honour to the amount
of £2,500, but the gambler's fever was strong within
him, accentuated by his enmity against Tenbury, and
amid the pause of silence which followed Sir Phineas's
announcement, he shouted:</p>

<p><said>I'll take you—in hundreds.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't bet in paltry sums,</said> rejoined Tenbury
coldly. <said>Nothing less than thousands.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, by all means. In thousands. I'll lay £5,000
on Tom Spring at the latest odds—5 to 4.</said></p>

<p><said>Are you sure you can pay?</said> rejoined Tenbury with
studied insolence of tone and manner.</p>

<p><said>Are you sure <emph>you</emph> can,</said> was Jack's retort.</p>

<p>An ugly glint shot into Tenbury's eyes, but he made
no reply, and booked the bet. Before he had finished
the entry in his book, a little man, very neatly dressed,
whispered something anxiously to the baronet. Jack
remembered this man, with his small, cunning eyes, his
unusually high cheek bones, and his little pointed,
obtrusive chin.</p>

<p><said>Do you know that fellow whispering to Sir
Phineas?</said> said Jack to Lard Walsham.</p>

<p><said>Yes—to my cost. He's a moneylender and a
gambling sharp. His name's Weare. Lives in Lyons
Inn. Goes in for shooting and coursing. Has half a
<pb n="69"/>
dozen dogs at his place in town. Keep out of his
clutches, Ralstone, if you don't want to be worried.</said></p>

<p><said>I stand to win £100 from him if Neate goes down.
He backed Neate 5 to 1.</said></p>

<p><said>I see,</said> laughed his lordship. <said>He's thinking that
if you have to pay up to Sir Phineas, there may be a
poor chance of his getting your £20. I hope to God
you'll have luck. Deuced unpleasant for you to owe
£5,000 to the man you're going to fight.</said></p>

<p><said>Why? It will be unpleasant for him, I grant,
because if he kills me he won't get paid at all. The
thought of that may spoil his aim. The luck's on my
side, you see.</said></p>

<p>Walsham was rather taken aback by Jack's non-
chalance.</p>

<p><said>You don't really mean that, do you?</said> said he.</p>

<p><said>Whatever I mean won't alter facts. If Neate wins,
why——</said></p>

<p>But the rest of his words were swallowed up in a
babel of sound. Gentleman Jackson, the <q>Commander-
in-Chief,</q> had entered the ring. He received an up-
roarious welcome, but nothing compared to what
followed within the next few minutes. Bill Neate,
the Bristol <q>pet,</q> arm-in-arm with his principal backer,
was seen making his way through the enthusiastic
crowd, and when he drew near the ropes he snatched off
his hat and tossed it into the enclosure. The applause
was deafening, but not more so than that which greeted
Tom Spring. Not a muscle of Tom's handsome face
moved. To look at him, so cool and confident, one
might have supposed he had been taking a walk and
had dropped in by accident. Sauntering up to the
ring, he dropped his hat just within, sprang over the
rope, and advanced to Neate, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>There were no looks of defiance on the part of either
gladiator, no <q>biting of the thumbs,</q> nothing melo-
dramatic. It was all as simple and natural as well
could be. The two athletes, who were about to bash
each other's faces and thump their bodies to the best
<pb n="70"/>
of their ability until one or the other was unable to
stand, simply shook hands.</p>

<p><said>I hope you are well,</said> said Spring.</p>

<p><said>I am very well, thank you; I hope you are,</said>
replied Neate.</p>

<p>Then the huge crowd, some 30,000 persons, prepared
to enjoy themselves.</p>

</div>


<div n="7" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="7">VII</num></head>
<head type="main">How Tom Spring and Bill Neate Fought</head>

<p>Up to the time when Tom entered the ring, Bill Neate
had been the one object of all eyes. Neate was a
splendidly-made man, all muscle and sinew, but hardly
the ideal athlete. He had enormous strength, but there
was a lack of symmetry in his build. His rugged, some-
what repellent face indicated great determination, and
that he was a sturdy boxer was shown by his terrific
fight some time before with the dreaded <soCalled>Gasman,</soCalled>
whose punishing powers were something phenomenal.
To look at the bosses of muscle around Neate's neck
and shoulders and in the upper half of the arms, one
could imagine what driving force he could put into a
blow when it was added to by the impetus of one of
his mighty rushes, for which he was famous. He was
animal strength, but there was no grace in his move-
ments.</p>

<p>On Spring doffing his <soCalled>beaver</soCalled> and vaulting over
the ropes with the agility of a practised gymnast, a roar
of voices hailed him, and the women's eyes glistened.
They saw in Tom the perfect man—a combination of
Apollo and Hercules. Not that his proportions were
Herculean, but because his muscles were so equally
developed and his frame so harmonious that both
would have satisfied the requirements of a sculptor.
His face matched his body. He was handsome; he
was intelligent. No one less like the traditional <soCalled>pug</soCalled>
ever stepped into the prize ring.</p>

<p>As Tom walked across the roped enclosure to his
<pb n="71"/>
corner, where Tom Cribb and Ned Painter (the only
man by whom Spring was ever beaten), his seconds,
were awaiting him, the light elastic tread and the perfect
action of his muscles showed how well his strength was
under control.</p>

<p>Any doubt Jack Ralstone might have had that
Spring would not carry off the belt vanished when Tom,
stripped for the fight, strode to his corner. He had
never seen Tom in the buff, for when they had a playful
set-to they had simply taken off their coats and waist-
coats, and he was amazed at Spring's physical develop-
ment. Moreover, he was in the pink of condition,
neither under nor over-trained. Ralstone was not far
from Spring's corner, and Tom, chancing to look round,
caught his eye, smiled and nodded.</p>

<p><said>I've backed you for all I'm worth and a little more,</said>
shouted Ralstone.</p>

<p><said>Thank you, sir. I shall do my best, you may be
sure,</said> said Tom simply.</p>

<p>At that moment Jack felt a touch on his shoulder.
He turned and recognised Dillnot, the Somersetshire
grazier, with whom he had made a bet at <q>The
Angel and Sun.</q> The grazier looked uncommonly
serious.</p>

<p><said>Just a word wi' you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone,</said> said the grazier
in a low voice. <said>A queer story reached me about a
fall-out atween you an' Squire Halstead. If it hadna'
ha' been that I got a bet on wi' 'ee, I shouldn't ha'
bothered, but——</said></p>

<p><said>You're afraid you wouldn't get your money, sup-
posing I lost, eh?</said> said Jack, cutting him short.</p>

<p><said>Aye. Seems to me, young gentleman, you be
agoing the whole hog. I heerd you betting with Sir
Phineas Tenbury, an' to a pretty tune. If Neate
wins——</said></p>

<p><said>If Neate wins!</said> repeated Jack contemptuously.
<said>He can't win excepting by an accident. Don't worry,
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dillnot, you'll be paid, never fear. By the way,
you mentioned the Squire. The thing seems to have
got wind, so there's no good in beating about the bush.
Yes, we've quarrelled and I've nothing more to do with
<pb n="72"/>
him. By the way, where is he? I expected to see him
on the ground, but he's nowhere about.</said></p>

<p><said>Aye, an' he's not likely to be. I told him as the
mill was coming off somewhere near here, but he would
have it Hungerford was the spot. You know how pig-
headed he can be. It wasn't no good contradicting.
so I let him have his way and away he's gone to
Hungerford wi' a lot o' other fules.</said></p>

<p>Jack burst into a laugh. He could picture Simon
Halstead's rabid rage on finding himself sold.</p>

<p>Further talk with Dillnot was impossible. Ominous
growlings were heard from the crowd. They resented
the favour shown to the nobs who were allowed to stand
close to the ropes, pressing against them and obstruct-
ing the view. Gentleman Jackson was equal to the
emergency. He knew that the roughs would show
but scant ceremony when their tempers were roused,
and he appealed to the Corinthians to draw further
back. <said>No persons but the referee and the umpires
can he allowed near the ropes,</said> he shouted in his clear,
stentorian voice, <said>and I ask you gentlemen to retire
to a little distance from the ring and to help keep the
ground clear.</said></p>

<p>The word of the <soCalled>General</soCalled> was law. Many of the
noblemen gathered round were his pupils, and highly
respected him. They obeyed without hesitation, and
the malcontents were satisfied.</p>

<p>Then came the tying of the combatants' colours—
Neate's orange-yellow and Spring's blue—to the stakes,
and all was in readiness. The yells, the shouts, the buzz
of talk, the laughter, died away. A deathlike silence
followed for a brief space, when the two combatants
advanced to the scratch and gravely shook hands to
show there was no ill-feeling.</p>

<p>A curious sound, like the sighing of a soft wind, rose
from the huge crowd. It was the end of a long-drawn
sigh of suspense. Not a soul was there whose nerves
and muscles did not tighten in sympathy with the
gladiators. who stood facing one another, eye fixed on
eye as if measuring their chances. They remained
thus, almost motionless, for nearly two minutes.</p>

<pb n="73"/>
<p>The curious thing was that neither man showed the
excitement of the spectators. This excitement was the
more intense because it was restrained, and betrayed
only by tightly-drawn lips and in the fixed glare of
dilated eyes. Who shall say what was the hypnotic
effect of 30,000 minds concentrated upon the efforts of
two men? Outwardly, at all events, they showed no
signs of being conscious of any outside influence. It
did not seem as if at that moment there was a single
person in the world other than their two selves. They
might have been statues.</p>

<p>But there was a difference in their expressions.
Spring, cool and confident, was if anything the more
serious of the two. Possibly he felt that the issue
depended on his science, his skill as a tactician, his
activity of body. Neate, on the other hand, though
an accomplished boxer, had not the resources possessed
by his antagonist. He relied upon his attack, upon that
mighty hit of his with which he did such execution in
the terrific fight with the famous <soCalled>Gasman,</soCalled> one of the
most formidable fighters who ever hurled his beaver
into the prize ring. There was just the semblance of a
smile of contempt on his hard face. It was known that
he had made certain of victory, and maybe he was
thinking of how he should punish the presumptuous
Spring for his temerity in challenging him for the
championship and the belt.</p>

<p>And so the two long minutes—to the spectators an
intolerable time—passed, and then suddenly Tom's
left arm shot out, quick as lightning. The opening
he sought for had not come. Neate avoided the blow
but did not retaliate, and once more came an ominous
pause as long as the first one. The real fight began
when Neate let fly one of his tremendous lunges. But
Tom was ready. He timed the blow with amazing
accuracy, and Neate's fist never got home. The pent-
up emotion of the crowd burst out at this pretty exhibi-
tion of skill, and shouts of applause resounded. Again
Neate attempted a furious rush and again failed, Spring
nodding and smiling as much as to say, <q>I expected
this sort of thing.</q></p>

<pb n="74"/>

<p><said>What the deuce be Bill Neate doing?</said> growled
Dillnot angrily. <said>Tom's got his hands down and Bill's
losing his chance.</said></p>

<p><said>Perhaps he knows better than you, Dillnot,</said>
whispered Jack. <said>Can't you see that Spring wants
him to come on?</said></p>

<p>Probably this was so, for Tom had laid himself open
to attack, but Neate declined the challenge. Both men
spurned mere slogging, and the scientific set-to which
followed the momentary cessation of hostilities is said
to be one of the finest ever seen. Spring's attitude for
administering punishment was that of a model boxer,
and Neate was hard put to defend himself, but he did
it, to the huge delight of his supporters. Then came a
succession of exchanges, and Spring dispelled all notions
that he was not a hard hitter. One blow which reached
his opponent's head was delivered with such force that
the impetus turned the striker round.</p>

<p>The fighting became intense. Neate was working for
all he was worth to get in his favourite crusher, and
Tom was busy with feet and hands. In retreating he
was forced back into a corner, close against the stake,
and it looked as if he could not escape the sledge-
hammer fist that was awaiting its opportunity. It was
a critical moment, and Tom Belcher, Neate's second,
yelled out excitedly:</p>

<p><said>Now's the time!</said></p>

<p>And it certainly was if Neate could only have got
through Spring's guard. But this he found impossible.
Tom frustrated every attempt, and was fighting his way
out when Neate, in despair of using his favourite stroke,
closed with his adroit opponent, and for a minute or
two nothing was seen but a couple of writhing, strugg-
ling bodies. Neate was the heavier man and a fine
wrestler, and his adherents, making sure that he would
throw Spring and fall upon him with his whole weight,
cheered him to the echo. Neate, indeed, nearly got
Tom off his legs, and the Spring-ites began to look
glum, when the unexpected happened. The crowd held
its breath. It saw Neate suddenly lifted from the
ground, turned over in Tom's arms, and thing heavily
<pb n="75"/>
to the ground, and Tom falling upon him. It was an
amazing piece of dexterity, and the betting at once rose
to 7 to 4 on Spring.</p>

<p>The first round was over. It had lasted nine to ten
minutes, but it could not be said that great damage
had been suffered on either side. Of the two, Neate
had had the worst of it. Tom's tactics were evidently
to weaken him, and the Somersetshire man's supporters
began to be restive. Why did he not inflict some of
those tremendous hits for which he was famous? It
was an unreasonable question, and those who asked it
forgot the reason. They had not reckoned with
Spring's extraordinary skill.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jack Ralstone had managed to book a few
bets at the new price. His mind was fixed on Spring's
victory, and he refused to believe that anything else
could happen. Once, indeed, he cast a glance at Sir
Phineas, and he exulted when he saw his enemy biting
his lips and scowling. At the same time he wondered,
supposing he won, whether he should get his money
from the spendthrift baronet. But there was the duel
to be reckoned with first.</p>

<p>The second round commenced with the backers of
Spring in high spirits. As before both men were
cautious, and a long pause followed, Neate evidently
seeking an opening. But he found none. Tom stood
in an easy attitude, and his handsome face wore a look
of the utmost confidence. Then Neate seemed to lose
patience and darted out with his right. It fell short,
and Spring's reply was a smart tap over his opponent's
eye—so smart, indeed, that the blood followed.</p>

<p><said>First blood, Neate,</said> was heard in Tom's voice all
over the ring, and Neate, who had staggered under the
blow, scowled savagely and, recovering himself, again
tried one of his heavy lunges, but again he failed to get
home. Quick as thought Spring retaliated and with
such vigour that Neate reeled and was within an ace of
falling. His party showed such dissatisfaction with
their man that some of them indulged in a prolonged
<q>Yah.</q> Stung by this, Neate dashed in blows
desperately and wildly. Tom met the attack with the
<pb n="76"/>
utmost coolness, and with a succession of skilful hits
sent his man to grass with the utmost ease.</p>

<p>The utmost consternation reigned among the Neate-
ites. They never expected anything like this. When
the rival party yelled, <q>It's all up. Neate hasn't a
chance!</q> they remained glum and silent. Two to one
was offered on Spring in a hundred places, but there
were no takers. As for Spring, he was jubilant.</p>

<p><said>It's as right as the day,</said> said he to Ned Painter,
his second, who was preparing him for the next round.
<said>He can't hit me in a week.</said></p>

<p>Clearly the idol had been knocked from his pedestal.
As a boxer Neate was not in the same rank as Spring.
He could now only rely on his luck. Luck goes for a
good deal in a prize-fight, and so Bill discovered, but it
was bad and not good luck. In the third round he
restored the drooping spirits of his backers by his
cleverness in turning aside a heavy blow, and they
applauded him, and Tom, with the chivalry of one
who, sure of victory, could afford to be generous to an
opponent, called out, <said>Well stopped, Neate.</said></p>

<p>After this there was more caution, and the two were
so close that their toes touched. If Neate ever had a
chance it had come now, but he could never get past
Spring's unbreakable guard. But by pertinacity he
managed to land a heavy one on Tom's ribs and a
spasm of pain went over Spring's face. His answer was
a clutch, and after a stiff bit of wrestling they fell, with
Neate underneath.</p>

<p>The fourth round showed that Neate, to use a modern
phrase, had had some of the <soCalled>stuffing</soCalled> knocked out of
him. His only chance was to attack, but for some
reason he did not do so. The experts standing round
were sure that to attempt to fight Spring scientifically
was the way to be beaten. He ought to have gone in
for heavy hitting, regardless of <choice><corr>punishment</corr><orig>punshment</orig></choice>, and his
supporters groaned aloud when Tom treated his blows,
delivered from a distance, as though they were they
blows of a child. One or two of Neate's efforts were so
palpably useless that derisive laughter, the most galling
sound that a boxer can hear, burst out in more than
<pb n="77"/>
one quarter. The round ended in the usual wrestling
rally, and was ended by Neate being thrown with
terrific force, Spring of course adding to the severity
of the fall by hurling his weight upon the prostrate
man.</p>

<p>The fifth round was little more than a farce. Neate
made no attempt at leviathan blows; indeed, he seemed
rather inclined to fall rather than meet Spring's steady,
workmanlike onslaught, over which Tom showed not
the slightest hurry. From Neate's demeanour it was
pretty evident that something had happened which
was not in the programme. What that something was
disclosed itself in a few words uttered by Tom Belcher,
who, with a serious look on his face, came to the side
of the rope and spoke to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jackson.</p>

<p><said>Neate can't go on,</said> said he in a low voice. <said>His
arm's fractured.</said></p>

<p><said>I perceive it,</said> was Jackson's reply, <said>but I shall not
notice it to the other side.</said></p>

<p>The last three rounds were tame enough. Neate
struggled on gamely and tried to get in some of his
deadly blows, but Spring stopped them almost con-
temptuously. Perhaps he suspected what was amiss
with Neate, but it was no business of his; so long as
Neate stood up to him, so long he would have to fight.
Anyhow he treated his opponent tenderly, and contented
himself with avoiding Neate's futile efforts for a <soCalled>knock-
out.</soCalled> Long before the eighth round had ended by
Neate being struck down and unable to come up to
time, all interest in the fight was over. A growl of
disappointment burst from Neate's supporters when
the Bristol man rose and shook hands with his con-
queror, but the growls were checked on Neate announc-
ing, almost with tears in his eyes, that he could fight no
more, for his arm was broken.</p>

<p><said>You've pulled it off, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone, an' I'll pay 'ee,</said>
grumbled Dillnot. <said>Dang it, but you be main lucky.
If Bill hadn't had that mishap, he'd 'a' pounded your
man to a jelly afore the fight was over.</said></p>

<p><said>That isn't what Cribb and the P.R. men say—
Neate's backers among 'em,</said> retorted Jack. <said>Tom
<pb n="78"/>
had Neate well in hand before the fourth round, and it
wasn't till then the accident happened.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, it doan't much matter, do it? What's done's
done. Here's your money. Don't fling it in the Lon-
don gutters as too many of you young Corinthians do.
Another bit o' counsel. Keep out o' old Squire Hal-
stead's way. He'll be fit to knock your head off if he
sees you. He said a few ugly things about 'ee as I
wouldn't like to tell 'ee.</said></p>

<p><said>I can quite believe it. Anyhow, we're not likely to
meet.</said></p>

<p>Dillnot untied a greasy leather bag and took from
it five hundred pounds in gold and notes. Jack stuffed
the five hundred pounds in his pockets without count-
ing it.</p>

<p><said>Ye don't vally money, young Squire,</said> said the
grazier pityingly. <said>Take care as ye don't coome to
want it. An' if I was you I'd look after Bill Weare.
He's a slippery card.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone was inclined to be of the same opinion, and
seeing the money-lender, after exchanging a few hurried
words with Sir Phineas, squeezing his way through the
crowd in company with a big, burly man, he went after
him and clapped his hand on his shoulder. Weare
turned round in affright.</p>

<p><said>Sorry to detain you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Weare, but it's the rule
for bets to be paid on the nail. I'll trouble you for one
hundred pounds,</said> said Jack coolly.</p>

<p><said>Eh? Oh, yes,</said> faltered Weare, <said>but I don't
carry the Mint about with me.</said></p>

<p><said>I didn't ask you for the Mint, but only for a trifling
hundred pounds.</said></p>

<p><said>By thunder, Weare,</said> said the big man at his side
with a loud strident laugh, <said>the young swell had you
there. Pay up, old cock. Faith, it's the best joke I've
ever heard. I'd walk twenty miles to see a miserly
money-lender part with his coin and get nothing for it.</said></p>

<p><said>What are you talking about, Jack Thurtell.</said>
<choice><corr>exclaimed</corr><orig>exclained</orig></choice> Weare whiningly. <said>You know as well as
anybody that I never carry much money about with
me.</said></p>

<pb n="79"/>
<p><said>That's not true,</said> cut in Ralstone quickly. <said>You
had plenty when you made the bet with me at the
<q>Angel and Sun.</q></said></p>

<p><said>That's right, young gentleman,</said> cried Thurtell
boisterously. <said>Stick to him. Shall I search his
pockets for you? Maybe he's got a secret one he
never shows in public.</said></p>

<p>The burly man brought his hand down on the small
of Weare's back with a force which made the money-
lender jump.</p>

<p><said>Thank you,</said> said Ralstone in a polite but distinctly
hostile tone, <said>but gentlemen don't collect their debts
like footpads. I prefer to trust to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Weare's honour.</said></p>

<p><said>More fool you,</said> said Thurtell with a truculent
look.</p>

<p>Jack Ralstone instinctively disliked Weare's friend
Thurtell. He had a hard, strong face, which bore the
indications of evil ungovernable passions. Jack did
not want to have anything to say to him, and he turned
away abruptly. But Thurtell was not to be put off.
He had been drinking heavily and was in the mood to
force a quarrel upon anyone.</p>

<p><said>Here, you,</said> he shouted, <said>are you one of the stuck-
up nobs that talk like parrots about boxing, but don't
know their right fist from their left?</said></p>

<p>Ralstone measured the abusive bully. He was tall
and very strongly made, and doubtless could fight.
Jack was in no humour to box a ruffian. There was no
glory in getting a black eye from such an antagonist or
in giving one either.</p>

<p><said>I don't think I am,</said> he retorted quietly.</p>

<p><said>I don't care whether you are or not. You've
insulted my friend Weare and I'm going to take it
out of you. I'm Jack Thurtell of Norwich, and as
I've had a turn up with Ned Carter, you'll take it I
know how to use my fists. Put up yours and let's see
who's best man.</said></p>

<p>The bellicose, half-drunken Thurtell threw himself
into a pugilistic attitude, and Ralstone saw there was
nothing left but to fight. He had hardly time to raise
his hands before Thurtell was upon him. A straight
<pb n="80"/>
blow aimed at his face Jack neatly caught on his elbow,
and he let fly with his left, catching Thurtell just below
the ear. Thurtell had ducked his head, but not quickly
enough, and down he went full length. He sprang to
his feet, but being a heavy man and out of condition,
he had not recovered himself sufficiently and Ralstone
planted, a hot 'un somewhere near the midriff. Thurtell
was doubled up with pain, and he sent out a volley of
oaths in lieu of blows.</p>

<p>Ralstone was ready to administer more punishment
when his arm was tightly grasped. Lord Walsham
was at his side.</p>

<p><said>Don't be a fool, Ralstone,</said> he remonstrated.
<said>What's the good of fighting that blackguard?</said></p>

<p><said>No good at all,</said> panted Jack. <said>But I had to do
it. He was going for me hot and strong.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, you've given him a lesson. Now come away.
That rascal's bound to have some of his friends near.
You'd better look out for reprisals.</said></p>

<p>It was clear Thurtell had no fight left in him. He
was still writhing on the ground. When he saw Ral-
stone going off with Lord Walsham, he yelled out:</p>

<p><said>We've got to settle this score some day, damn you.
Jack Thurtell's not the man to let a stuck-up Corinthian
ride rough shod over him. I'll spoil your beauty for
you yet.</said></p>

<p><said>Who's the ruffian?</said> said Ralstone.</p>

<p><said>No good. Gets his living by his wits and his
bullying. I'm told he's known as <q>Terrible Jack.</q>
He's been mixed up in more than one shady affair.
He and his friend Weare, the money-lender, are just
now as thick as thieves. Wait till they fall out.</said></p>

<p>The mention of Weare brought to Jack Ralstone's
mind the money-lender's debt. The <soCalled>scrap</soCalled> with
Thurtell had driven all other things out. He looked
round. Weare had seized the opportunity to escape.</p>

<p><said>No matter. I've his address—Lyons Inn.</said></p>

<p><said>Humph, if you think Weare will pay his debts of
honour,</said> said the young nobleman dryly, <said>you're living
in a fool's paradise. Men like Weare don't know what
honour is.</said></p>

<pb n="81"/>

<p><said>Very likely. And what about Tenbury. He's
mizzled too.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, Tenbury'll pay if he can borrow the coin. As
you're going to fight him, he'll do anything rather than
not meet you on equal terms. He's that sort of fellow.
He boasts of not being under an obligation to any man
in the world, barring money-lenders, Jews, and trades-
men, and they don't count. They're not worth his
notice.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, he can do as he likes. The end of the duel
may be that it won't matter to me whether he pays
up or not. Anyhow, for the moment I'm more interested
in scooping up my gains than in anything else. I'll
tell you why later on. Luckily the men who are in
my debt are not all Weares and Tenburys.</said></p>

<p>This was the fact, and for the next half-hour he was
busy in settling with those who had betted with him
on the ground. When all was done he found that he
had a respectable sum with which to start life in Lon-
don. He could afford to wait for Sir Phineas Tenbury's
money.</p>

<p><said>We shall have a bother in getting to town. You
know this country better than I do. What do you
propose?</said> asked the young lord.</p>

<p><said>It's no good trying to get a seat in the coach.
There'll be something like a free fight for places. And
I doubt if a postchaise is to be had at any price. We
can't stay in Andover and be starved. They told me
at the <q>George</q> this morning they'd only got bones
in the larder. Why not tramp it to Salisbury and take
the coach there? Salisbury's out of the beaten track.</said></p>

<p><said>How far?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, twelve miles or so.</said></p>

<p><said>Good. Then let's start. By the way, where are
you staying in town?</said></p>

<p><said>Don't quite know. Maybe at the <q>Tavistock,</q>
Covent Garden. They know me there.</said></p>

<p><said>A bit noisy, isn't it? Why not put up at my place
in the Albany?</said></p>

<p>Jack thanked Walsham for his proffered hospitality,
<pb n="82"/>
but said that he'd made up his mind to go on his
own.</p>

<p><said>I shall have to do it sooner or later, and I'd better
get used to the sensation.</said></p>

<p>Then he told his friend how he had quarrelled with
his stepfather—a piece of news which made Lord
Walsham shake his head.</p>

<p><said>How are you going to live?</said></p>

<p><said>The deuce only knows. If I'm stranded I may
take up boxing.</said></p>

<p><said>Faith, a fine living you'll make at that game. All
your future will be—a tavern. That's the only thing
the retired pug thinks of. I fancy I see you drawing
pints of heavy wet or quarterns of <q>max</q> (gin) for
the greasy mob.</said></p>

<p>Jack laughed but made no reply. There was sense
in the young nobleman's words, as he well knew.</p>

<p>Then they set out at a good four-mile pace for their
spin to Salisbury.</p>
</div>


<div n="8" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="8">VIII</num></head>
<head type="main">A Bombshell for Lady Barbara</head>

<p><said>By gad, Barbara, I never saw you look handsomer.
What's the gaiety to-night?</said></p>

<p><said>Almack's, of course.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara's tone was a little scornful. She
hated being questioned as to her movements, and was
rather inclined to snub her ducal papa, as daughters
impatient of control are wont.</p>

<p><said>Oh, of course,</said> rejoined the duke dryly. He was
quite conscious of the snub, but with the servants
moving about he was not going to engage in an alter-
cation with her ladyship.</p>

<p>He was dining <foreign xml:lang="fr">tête-a-tête</foreign> with his daughter. There
were but their two selves, but the etiquette was as
formal as though a score of guests had assembled. The
ceremony was all the more noticeable because of the
vastness of the apartment. The doors were of unusual
width and height, to permit the comfortable entrance
<pb n="83"/>
of the ladies of <foreign xml:lang="fr">ton</foreign> in the days of the second George,
with their prodigious hoops and head-dresses of pre-
posterous height. The ceiling was gorgeously decorated,
Sir James Thornhill's sprawling nymphs and cupids
displaying themselves with languorous grace amid blue
clouds and gilt borderings. Portraits of past Endsleighs
in the picturesque dress of the Stuarts, the full bottom
wigs and ample skirts of the early Hanoverians, and the
affected cravats and roll collared coats of the Regency,
filled the panelled walls, against which were ranged buhl
and console tables of florid design, gilt chairs and other
furnitures of French design—the fashion which set in
after the occupation of Paris by our troops following
the battle of Waterloo.</p>

<p>The room would have been imposing enough could
it have been properly lighted. But his Grace. like the
Duke of Devonshire, hated lamps—no doubt they were
smoky and smelly enough—and the new illuminant—
coal gas—was far too vulgar to be thought of. Nothing
but wax candles was endurable. A hundred candles
would not have been too many; the candelabra on the
table held but twenty. The expanse of white napery,
the glittering cutlery, the polished silver and glass
caught all the light. The servants moved about in the
surrounding gloom like shadows.</p>

<p>The duke sat at one end of the table and Lady
Barbara at the other. Anything like connected con-
versation was very difficult. But this did not matter
much. Neither father nor daughter was inclined to
talk. It was not until the dinner was over and the
servants had quitted the room that his Grace, eyeing
his glass critically, remarked:</p>

<p><said>I suppose you're in no violent hurry. It's but
eight o'clock, and I take it that the quadrilles and
waltzes aren't in full swing until ten. If you're anything
like me you won't care to be troubled by preliminaries.
You'll prefer to be on the top of the tide.</said></p>

<p><said>I hate <foreign xml:lang="fr">ennui</foreign>,</said> said Lady Barbara languidly.</p>

<p><said>By all means. To avoid <foreign xml:lang="fr">ennui</foreign> is the one aim of
life. But at the risk of boring you to death, Barbara,
<pb n="84"/>
I want to talk to you. We can't shout at each other
across the table. Come to the fire.</said></p>

<p>An arm-chair was on one side of the large fire-place
and a settee on the other. His Grace took up a position
with his back to the fire and pointed to the settee.
Her ladyship, looking not over-pleased at the proposi-
tion, obeyed. She apprehended an unpleasant dis-
cussion and she folded her really beautiful arms, bare
to the shoulder, defiantly, and pouted her full lips.</p>

<p><said>I hope you won't keep me long, papa,</said> said she.
<said>I've not finished dressing yet.</said></p>

<p><said>So I perceive,</said> rejoined his Grace, a cold smile
curving his thin lips, his eyes resting for a moment on
the young lady's daring corsage.</p>

<p>The duke combined the punctilious courtesy of Lord
Chesterfield with the insolence of a Brummell. What
he lacked in heart he made up in superficial wit. He
lived entirely for himself, and professed a sort of callous
philosophy which made him indifferent to the opinions
and feelings of others. He hated everything which was
low, vulgar and ugly, and money he regarded as a
means solely to procure him pleasure.</p>

<p>His Grace preceded what he wished to say by taking
a pinch of snuff. He had an elegant precision—partly
natural, partly carefully educated—in everything he
did, and he prided himself on the way he held and
tapped his snuff-box with his long, white, delicate fingers,
and conveyed the snuff to his thin, aquiline, high-bred
nose.</p>

<p><said>Is it true, Barbara, that you've broken with young
Ralstone?</said></p>

<p><said>No. We've had a few words, but the engagement's
just the same, I believe.</said></p>

<p><said>You believe. Don't you know?</said></p>

<p><said>Hadn't you better ask <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone?</said> said her
ladyship disdainfully.</p>

<p><said>Hardly necessary, if his father speaks the truth.
The old fellow's a vulgar boor, but I fancy his word
may be taken. Receiving a very vague and unsatis-
factory—and I may add, illiterate—letter from him, I
took occasion before I left Bath to ride out to his place.
<pb n="85"/>
I discovered him in a beastly state of intoxication and
smelling offensively of rum—a liquor which always
makes me feel sick—but sane enough.</said></p>

<p><said>I hope your Grace didn't go to see him on <emph>my</emph>
account,</said> broke in Lady Barbara.</p>

<p><said>Why not?</said> inquired the duke blandly. <said>I trust
I may be pardoned for feeling some solicitude in regard
to my only daughter. But you'd better hear what I
have to say. It seems that he and young Ralstone had
had a few words about nothing at all, but the young
fellow had got his back up, and on hearing the contents
of my letter to Simon Halstead, suggesting a speedy
marriage——</said></p>

<p><said>A speedy marriage? Between me and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ral-
stone?</said> burst out the young lady, <said>you'd no business
to suggest anything of the kind. <emph>I</emph> am the one to decide
that—not you. You never told me you had written.</said></p>

<p><said>Please don't be so impetuous. Am I not telling
you now? The upshot of the thing is that Ralstone
refuses to fulfil his engagement.</said></p>

<p>At this bombshell Lady Barbara's face went scarlet
and her blue eyes blazed. She trembled with rage
and her slippered foot beat a tattoo on the floor.</p>

<p><said>It's an intolerable slight—a gross insult,</said> she cried.
<said>He deserves to be horsewhipped.</said></p>

<p><said>If you had a brother probably such a punishment
might be inflicted, or at least attempted, for I'm told
Ralstone is remarkably handy with his fists. It's
unthinkable that <emph>I</emph> can take such a step. I abominate
a vulgar fracas. Of course, I might call him out, but
I regard making oneself ridiculous as the greatest crime
a man of my rank and position can commit. What is
more to the purpose is the origin of the unpleasant
imbroglio. I understood old Halstead to say that
Ralstone thinks you have been rude to him.</said></p>

<p><said>It's false. If I were rude, he gave me cause. He
was abominably impertinent.</said></p>

<p><said>I see. Bad temper seems inseparable from love.
I don't recollect that I was ever guilty of such folly.
My courtship with your mother went remarkably
smoothly.</said></p>

<pb n="86"/>

<p><said>I dare say. Neither of you, probably, knew what
love was,</said> retorted Lady Barbara hotly.</p>

<p><said>Nor wanted to know, perhaps. Love's another
name for folly. The case of young Ralstone, for
instance. He's lost a big fortune——</said></p>

<p><said>A big fortune? Why, he hasn't a penny of his
own.</said></p>

<p><said>Exactly. He's now stranded—left high and dry.
The old man's virtually cut him off with the proverbial
shilling, and all because of you. I'm bound to say,
however, from what Halstead told me, that the fellow
stood up to his firebrand of a stepfather like a man.
He wouldn't budge an inch, and so they parted in
anger.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara's face changed. She hardly knew
whether to be pleased or sorry at Jack's misfortunes.
Anyhow, it was all his own fault. There was no reason
why he should have broken with her. If he acted
through jealousy—well, that was in his favour. It
showed her power over him, and what is so pleasing
to a woman as power of this kind? Could she have
been mistaken in thinking that he was a tame cat
always ready to do what he was told? But she could
not decide then. Her father was going on with his
talk.</p>

<p><said>The failure of this marriage, my dear Barbara, is
a profound disappointment to me. Old Halstead was
prepared to hand over a sum out of which I could have
given you a substantial dowry, while the balance would
have relieved me from my immediate difficulties.</said></p>

<p><said>It would have made no difference. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Halstead's
money would have followed where the thousands you've
thrown away have gone—cards.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm not so sure. A run of ill-luck can't continue
for ever. It's bound to turn if only I can weather the
storm meanwhile. But suppose we leave my debts
alone and turn to others infinitely more interesting—
yours.</said></p>

<p><said>Mine? What have my paltry debts to do with the
matter?</said></p>

<p><said>Everything, I've a pile of your bills—silks and
<pb n="87"/>
shawls and I don't know what from the mercer on
Ludgate Hill, millinery from <choice><reg>Cranbourne</reg><orig>Cranborne</orig></choice> Alley, haber-
dashery, gloves, trinkets from Burlington Arcade, the
dressmaker in Bow Street, the——</said></p>

<p><said>Pray don't be so monstrously ridiculous, papa,</said>
interrupted Barbara impatiently. <said>There's nothing in
the list that I can do without—nothing that every
woman of fashion isn't entitled to have. They're all
everyday necessities. I've been exceedingly moderate.
You ought to have Lady Amersham's bills to pay.</said></p>

<p><said>Lady Amersham is an extremely handsome woman,
and knows how to dress. I should be delighted to pay
her bills if I had the wherewithal, and it would afford
me even greater pleasure if I could pay yours, my dear
Barbara. I think, in the way of beauty, you could
give points, and you have the immeasurable advantage
of youth. But the real point is that your debts amount
to nearly five thousand pounds, and I haven't five
thousand shillings.</said></p>

<p><said>Let the shopkeepers wait,</said> retorted her ladyship
scornfully.</p>

<p><said>I quite agree with you, and, saving the extremely
vulgar and unpleasant letters I'm constantly receiving,
I don't know that they can do anything very serious.
I suppose they couldn't put you in King's Bench
prison.</said></p>

<p><said>Put me in prison? <emph>Me?</emph> Oh, really, you can't
know what you're saying.</said></p>

<p><said>Indeed I do. I hate musty law, and I abominate
dried-up, long-faced attorneys; but both are sometimes
useful. You see, my child, those debts of yours have
been incurred since you came of age, and you're now
twenty-two. You had a little money of your own——</said></p>

<p><said>It wasn't much, and it soon went.</said></p>

<p><said>I knew it would. You haven't the Dacre blood in
you for nothing. Anticipating some contretemps, such
as now has happened, I took precautions. I instructed
Benson to write to your tradesmen—I know them all
from the bills I paid for you before you came to the
years of discretion—ahem !—warning them that I was
no longer responsible for your debts. The scoundrels,
<pb n="88"/>
notwithstanding, have sent their bills to me, and I had
last week to get Benson to remind them of my repudia-
tion of my liability, and that if they gave you credit
they did so at their own risk. So, my dear, you see
where you stand.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara was disgusted, and she showed her
disgust in her expression, but she said nothing. She
knew her father's egotism, his selfishness, his affected
cynicism.</p>

<p><said>But you needn't despair. You have your youth,
your beauty, your superb health—three most valuable
assets. Failing young Ralstone—who, by the way, is
not quite out of the running, if you're not so foolish as
to indulge in a sentimental passion for some handsome
but undesirable <foreign xml:lang="fr">parti</foreign>.</said></p>

<p><said>Jack Ralstone isn't out of the running, you say,</said>
returned Barbara, after a pause. <said>In what way?</said></p>

<p><said>His stepfather is still keen upon you as his step-
daughter-in-law, and he admitted that if Ralstone came
round and made it up with you that he would be willing
to let bygones be bygones. So you still have a trump.
card in your hand. If you don't choose to play it, then
you must angle for yourself. Whether any other
father-in-law would be willing to help me is another
matter.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, there's a road open to you for that purpose,
papa. I wonder you haven't thought of it.</said></p>

<p><said>And what is that road, may I ask?</said></p>

<p><said>Marry a rich widow. There's <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Coutts—the
richest woman in Great Britain, so the newspapers say.
The old banker died over a year ago, and she's bound
to marry again. I read the other day that her husband
left her six hundred and seventy thousand pounds, and
she has half the profits every year of the banking
business. That ought to tempt you.</said></p>

<p><said>It does tempt me, but—but—<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Coutts!</said></p>

<p><said>Well, she's not much more than forty, and really
not bad looking even now. She's not to my taste, but
that's nothing. I dare say I could make myself
agreeable to her.</said></p>

<p><said><choice><corr>Doubtless</corr><orig>Doutless</orig></choice>, but I prefer her as a hostess. Her
<pb n="89"/>
dinners at Stratton Street are superb. She'll probably
try the bonds of matrimony once more, but they won't
enclose me.</said></p>

<p><said>Why not? You're quite young looking for your
age.</said></p>

<p>Barbara had risen and was standing in front of the
duke, her well-formed, if somewhat large, hands resting
lightly on his shoulders. Her large swimming eyes were
fixed on his face.</p>

<p><said>My dear Barbara, what an ass young Ralstone
must be, if he ever saw you as you are now. But
perhaps he never did.</said></p>

<p><said>He has only himself to blame.</said></p>

<p>Her shoulders rose and her bosom heaved slightly.
One might have thought she was thinking of the man
who was so blind to her charms. The thought would
have been erroneous. It was Sir Phineas Tenbury
whose mocking face her imagination was picturing.</p>

<p><said>Don't let us talk of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone,</said> she went on
irritably. <said>I'm curious to know your opinion of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Coutts.</said></p>

<p><said>My opinion is that she is a keen, masterful woman
of business. Not to my taste at all. We should quarrel
within a week. As to my age—she has had experience
of one elderly husband; she doesn't want another.
She'll possibly marry again, but it will be to some young
fool with a handle to his name. That sort of woman
generally does. Apart from that, the ugly story of her
capture of old Coutts—the secret marriage a week or
two after the funeral of the first <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Coutts—a
marriage for which she herself obtained the licence from
Doctor's Commons—the bribing of old Raymond, the
actor, to be the only witness—the payment to the parson
for performing the decidedly irregular ceremony and
for forging two false entries in the register to hoodwink
the vicar—no thank you. I'll leave <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Coutts alone.
Very pleased to put my legs under her mahogany,
seeing that royal dukes condescend to do the same,
but marriage—it's not to be thought of. Besides, she
wouldn't have me. A fine tale to go the rounds of
<pb n="90"/>
White's or Boodle's—the Duke of Endsleigh rejected by
the widow Coutts!</said></p>

<p>For once the real duke was seen beneath the society
veneer. Barbara was struck by his tone of acerbity,
the hardening of his smooth, clean-shaven face. She
wondered whether her father had really tried his luck
at Stratton Street, or was it a case of the fox and the
grapes?</p>

<p><said>Oh, no doubt you're right,</said> said she; <said>but what's
to be done?</said></p>

<p><said>It all depends upon you. I've told you what
trumps you hold. It's for you to play your hand
skilfully. Don't forget that Ralstone's still a fish to
be played with. He's darted away like a restive
salmon, but he's not off the hook.</said></p>

<p>And as a sign that the talk was at an end, his Grace
walked to the table, poured himself out a glass of port,
which he drank at a gulp. When he again turned
towards the fire his daughter had vanished.</p>

<div n="9" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="9">IX</num></head>
<head type="main">An Infamous Plot</head>

<p>An hour later a carriage stopped at the entrance of
<choice><reg>Cranbourne</reg><orig>Cranborne</orig></choice> Alley, Leicester Square, and the footman,
springing from his stand behind, opened the carriage
door, and a lady muffled in a cloak and with a hood
drawn well down over her head, tripped lightly to one
of the many milliners' shops within the alley. She
rapped at the door impatiently. It was opened by a
stout woman, with square shoulders and a pronounced
bust, hard features and small, twinkling beadlike eyes.</p>

<p><said>La! Is it your ladyship? I did not expect you.
Will you please walk in?</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara passed inside rapidly and waited until
the door was closed before she spoke. Then in a low,
anxious voice:</p>

<p><said>Have you a letter for me, <choice><corr>Matthews</corr><orig>Mattews</orig></choice>?</said></p>

<pb n="91"/>
<p><said>Yes, m'lady. It came this evening about two hours
ago.</said></p>

<p><said>Give it me at once, please.</said></p>

<p>The woman disappeared into a room behind the shop
and returned with a letter, of which Lady Barbara
broke the seal in feverish haste. The epistle ran:</p>

<q type="letter">
<p><hi rend="sc">Dearest</hi>,—Unable to see you at Almack's until
after midnight. Till then I am the most miserable of
mortals. Your devoted admirer, P.T.</p>
</q>

<p>Lady Barbara's blue eyes gleamed for a moment,
and then the lids drooped, and she gave a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p><said>I was fearful he might disappoint me. And I want
to see him so much—so much,</said> she sighed.</p>

<p>She folded up the letter and slid it within the bosom
of her dress.</p>

<p><said>Thank you, Matthews. That's all.</said></p>

<p><said>Not quite all, I'm afraid. I beg your pardon for
reminding you of your promise. I trust you will be
able to oblige me with some money. I have my rent
to meet and——</said></p>

<p><said>Yes—yes,</said> interjected Lady Barbara irritably.
<said>I know all about that. I've heard it before. I really
can't be bothered about money to-night.</said></p>

<p>The woman's eyes had in them an ugly glint.</p>

<p><said>I'm sorry to hear that. It would save you much
trouble and worry if you could oblige me.</said></p>

<p><said>It's quite impossible. I don't carry my purse with
me when I attend a ball.</said></p>

<p><said>Nor when your ladyship's not attending one either,</said>
rejoined <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews, suddenly becoming impudent.
<said>I suppose I'd better speak plainly. I must tell you
that unless you pay me fifty pounds by to-morrow
night the consequences may be very serious for your
ladyship.</said></p>

<p><said>Whatever do you mean, Matthews? You'll have
every penny I owe you, but you'll have to wait like
other tradespeople.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara spoke angrily and haughtily, after the
<pb n="92"/>
fashion of the Upper <sic>Ten</sic>, who in those days were in-
variably rude and imperious to the people who kept
shops, even though the shopkeeper might be far
wealthier than his or her customer. They thought it
an intolerable piece of presumption to be asked for
money. As a rule, the shopkeeper accepted the snub-
bings humbly, but not <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews, on this occasion
at all events.</p>

<p><said>I'm not going to follow the example of other trades-
men. I don't intend to wait,</said> said she, planting her
arms akimbo and sidling in front of Lady Barbara, so
that the latter should not escape without hearing what
she had to say.</p>

<p><said>You're exceedingly impertinent, Matthews. You
forget yourself,</said> exclaimed Lady Barbara wrathfully.</p>

<p><said>Indeed I don't. It is your ladyship who forgets.
Do you suppose I'm going to allow my house to be
used as a place of assignation and not be paid?</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara went very white.</p>

<p><said>Of course not,</said> she faltered. <said>But Sir Phineas—
has he not given you money? I understood——</said></p>

<p><said>Sir Phineas has, like your ladyship, given me
nothing but promises. I've told you what I want—
fifty pounds. If I don't get it by the time I mentioned,
I shall send the bill to the duke, and shall not forget to
tell him what it's for.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara trembled. Not for ten thousand
worlds would she have her indiscretion known to her
father. Equally disastrous would it be if <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mat-
thews opened her mouth to her gossips. Good-bye
then to her chances of marriage with a rich man, either
aristocrat or <foreign>parvenu</foreign>.</p>

<p><said>Surely you'd not do anything so disgraceful,</said> she
returned in a choking voice.</p>

<p><said>Your ladyship can easily avoid exposure,</said> was the
woman's cold reply.</p>

<p><said>Cannot you give me a little longer time?</said></p>

<p><said>No. I must have my money before to-morrow
night.</said></p>

<p>The unhappy Lady Barbara could make no reply.
She was overwhelmed. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews, having
<pb n="93"/>
delivered her ultimatum, moved aside, opened the door,
and the young lady, her head bent down, hurried to her
carriage, and, once inside flung herself in a corner, her
eyes filled with tears of rage and shame. Yet within
an hour she was apparently enjoying herself immensely
amid the exclusiveness of Almack's, so much so that the
all powerful Lady Jersey condescended to compliment
her on her attractiveness.</p>

<p><said>You ought to make a conquest to-night, Lady
Barbara,</said> said the lady autocrat, surveying the young
woman critically. <said>You're certainly the handsomest
girl in the room.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara made a curtsy in acknowledgment of
her ladyship's compliment, and murmured, as in duty
bound, some words depreciatory of herself.</p>

<p><said>Don't talk nonsense,</said> returned the high and mighty
lady patroness. <said>A girl in her first season should
always make the best of herself. Then is her chance.
The King was pleased to be charmed with you at your
presentation. Is it true that you're engaged to <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Ralstone? I knew his father very well in my young
days. His widow, I consider, disgraced herself terribly
by marrying a sugar planter. I've never seen the man,
but it's impossible he can be otherwise than a vulgarian.
But I suppose he's very rich, and money, like charity,
covers a multitude of sins.</said></p>

<p>And with a cold smile the arbiter of fashion sailed
away.</p>

<p>The mention of Jack Ralstone's name sent Lady
Barbara's heart cold. She was very thankful, however,
that Lady Jersey had not questioned her about the
position of affairs. She would not have known how to
reply. It was very clear that the breaking of her
engagement was not known in society, and for this also
she was glad.</p>

<p>Ever since her talk with her father Lady Barbara
had been torn by doubts and fears. Amid her torment-
ing reflections, self reproach, resentment, consciousness
of folly, and the rest, thoughts of Ralstone occupied
the first place. His defection, without a word of
explanation to her, had wounded her vanity and piqued
<pb n="94"/>
her self-love. It was an insult to her womanhood,
for, as a philosopher has observed, a woman may forgive
an injury, but a slight, never. She was burning to
punish him. But how? The most fitting retribution
would be to bring him to her feet and then laugh him
to scorn.</p>

<p>The duke's suggestion of her power to tempt and
conquer men had sunk deeply into her mind. She knew
she had this power, but she had always been too proud
to use it. Certainly she had never tried to use it over
Jack Ralstone. It did not seem worth while. Know-
ing he was bound to her, she did not trouble about him.
Now that he had thrown her over a revulsion of feeling
had set in. She wanted him back. Not that she loved
him. Sir Phineas had spoilt <emph>that</emph> emotion—at all
events for a time. No, it was to humble him, if
possible. But really, at that moment, with the
expectation of seeing Sir Phineas hovering at the back
of her mind, she was in such confusion she could not
bring herself to a calm judgment.</p>

<p>To distract her thoughts she plunged wildly into
dancing. She had no lack of partners. Her vivacity,
the result of over-strained nerves, amounting almost to
hysteria, was in such contrast with the primness of
most of the London <foreign xml:lang="fr">belles</foreign> that when not dancing she
was the centre of a group of admirers.</p>

<p>When twelve o'clock was near Lady Barbara became
very nervous. Her eyes were fixed on the door by which
Sir Phineas was bound to enter, and lest she should
miss him she begged to be excused, on the score of
fatigue, the waltz she had promised. She then withdrew
into one of the ante-rooms to collect herself. The door-
way commanded a view of the entrance, and she had
been sitting scarcely five minutes when she saw him
come in and scrutinise the dancers. She rose to meet
him, but resumed her seat on seeing him cross the ball-
room in the direction of the ante-chamber. She became
greatly agitated, and was fanning herself vigorously
when he came into the room and sat himself down by
her side.</p>

<pb n="95"/>

<p><said>You look charming to-night, Lady Barbara,</said> he
whispered. <said>You are adorable.</said></p>

<p><said>I feel neither the one nor the other,</said> she returned
a little pettishly, and found relief for her disturbed
nerves in fingering the fringe of her fan.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas gazed at her with animalism pictured in
his eyes. He certainly had not exaggerated his com-
pliments. The haughtiness habitual to her had dis-
appeared, and with it an affectation which made her
beauty somewhat insipid. Emotion had given her
expression, and there was something in that expression
which was peculiarly agreeable to the temperament of
the man whose eyes were fixed gloatingly upon her.
To see women suffer was one of his pleasures.</p>

<p>The dress Lady Barbara was wearing became her
delightfully. It was of white muslin, with a deep
ornamental border of gold edging the skirt. The waist
came nearly to her armpits, and the puffed sleeves—
if the cluster of material cunningly woven together by
the dressmaker's deft fingers could be called a sleeve—
it was really a puff intersected by ribbon—accentuated
the statuesque shoulders above and her full, round
arms below. White kid gloves reached to her elbows,
and white satin dancing shoes encased her small feet.
Her bright tawny hair, inclining naturally to curl,
showed signs of rebellion beneath the gauze turban of
light blue, and a rope of pearls encircled her neck and
seemed to vibrate with life at every rise and fall of her
bosom. The costume brought to the mind a picture
of a wilful, capricious hoyden, and the suggestion of
spoilt childishness imparted a piquancy to her charms
altogether alluring.</p>

<p><said>Why are you so late?</said> said she with an effort.</p>

<p><said>You had my note.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, yes. It was horribly disappointing. I wish
I'd not called for it. I wanted you so much. I hoped
you would have been here earlier. I'm distraught.
Such frightful things have occurred.</said></p>

<p><said>Frightful? To you? What frightful things could
possibly happen to my beautiful Barbara?</said> he returned
with a quizzical smile.</p>

<pb n="96"/>

<p><said>If you'll try to be serious I'll tell you. To begin
with, I'm horribly in debt. I want fifty pounds at
once.</said></p>

<p><said>What, to-night?</said></p>

<p><said>To-morrow at the latest. It's to stop the mouth
of that vile traitress Matthews. She has threatened to
disclose everything to the Duke unless she's paid. You
told me that you would satisfy her, and you haven't.
It was unkind of you, Phineas.</said></p>

<p><said>Not intentional unkindness, dearest. It was a
physical impossibility. I've been infernally hit over
that fight at Andover. I backed Neate heavily, and
the fellow was licked.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm sorry. But fifty pounds—it's a mere trifle.
You can let me have that, surely.</said></p>

<p><said>Coax it out of his Grace. You can twist your father
round your little finger if you care to do so.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't care. It would be of no use. I had a most
unpleasant talk with him this evening—I've got to tell
you about that—and in the course of it he told me he'd
no available money at all. Think of it! The Duke
of Endsleigh penniless!</said></p>

<p><said>Sounds bad, of course. But penniless noblemen
seem to get on very well. Having no money is but an
incentive to borrow more and spend more.</said></p>

<p><said>That's nonsense. Anyhow, Matthews must be
satisfied. You see that, don't you?</said></p>

<p><said>I <choice><corr>don't</corr><orig>dont</orig></choice> see what harm the Jezebel can do you.
Neither the Duke nor any one else would believe her
slanders.</said></p>

<p><said>Indeed, you're wrong. Slanders are the only
things people <emph>do</emph> believe. Think of me—my repu-
tation——</said></p>

<p><said>I'm always thinking of you, sweetest. But about
the Duke. You were saying——</said></p>

<p><said>He refused to pay any more of my bills. A whole
year's debts have accumulated. I owe I don't know
how much, and all that the Duke can suggest is that I
should marry a rich man.</said></p>

<p><said>Excellent advice. Why don't you follow it?</said></p>

<p><said>Phineas! And you?</said></p>

<pb n="97"/>

<p><said>I'm out of the running—as a husband. I haven't
a stiver. I've never made any secret of that. Why
don't you marry young Ralstone?</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara started to her feet. Her face had
gone chalky white even to her lips.</p>

<p><said>Do <emph>you</emph> tell me that? Have I then been simply
your toy?</said> she flung at him in tones subdued enough
but vibrating with intense passion.</p>

<p><said>Sit down, Barbara, and let us talk out this thing
quietly. It's no time for heroics.</said></p>

<p>His eyes hardened and he grasped her bare arm above
the elbow with a savage pressure that told of his
mastery over her. She obeyed tremblingly.</p>

<p><said>I love you more than I've loved any woman. I've
lost my heart, but I'm not going to lose my head. I
confess that I wanted to cut out Ralstone, and I've
succeeded. I know very well you're mine——</said></p>

<p><said>And you'd have me marry him! Your boasted
love's a sham! I——</said></p>

<p>Her voice died away in an excess of anger.</p>

<p><said>My love for you is part of my life. You'll be just
the same to me no matter whose wife you are and I'll
swear I shall be the same to you. If you were married
to that fellow Ralstone I should love you a thousand
times more than I do now, if it were possible. I hate
him. I've reason to. I've had a bit of my revenge.
I've robbed him of you. I wonder how he'd feel if
he knew it. But I shan't be satisfied until you're his
wife.</said></p>

<p><said>That will never be,</said> cried Barbara with emphasis.</p>

<p><said>Never! Have you given him his <foreign xml:lang="fr"><choice><corr>congé</corr><orig>congè</orig></choice></foreign>?</said></p>

<p><said>No. It is the other way about. He has refused to
marry me.</said></p>

<p><said>Because of me?</said> sneeringly asked Sir Phineas.</p>

<p><said>I can't tell. I should think not. Save that abomin-
able creature Matthews, who knows of our secret meet-
ings? My engagement to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone is broken off
and so is his dependence on his stepfather. He won't
have any allowance from him for the future. Of course
I can no longer expect to marry him.</said></p>

<p>Tenbury's face became as black as a thundercloud.
<pb n="98"/>
His complete revenge would have been to see Barbara
Ralstone's wife and yet retain his hold over her. He
had nursed this plan until he was sanguine of its success.
It was this which prompted him to pursue Lady
Barbara until he had absolute power over her.</p>

<p>The plot had failed if the marriage could not be
brought about. The sense of discomfiture—for Ral-
stone had up to the present won all along—galled him
to the quick, and he sat scowling, motionless and
apparently oblivious of the agitated woman by his
side.</p>

<p><said>You jilted the fellow then?</said> he jerked out sud-
denly.</p>

<p><said>No. He simply told his stepfather he didn't intend
to marry me. He hasn't even deigned to acquaint me
with his decision. It's an insult.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas relapsed into his fit of stony abstraction.
He could only ascribe Ralstone's extraordinary conduct
to one cause—some other woman had captured him.
And the woman? She of the dark eyes, the raven
hair? The Venus clad in rags? It was certain she
had gone away with him. Since then all trace of her
had vanished, in spite of Sir Phineas's efforts and the
efforts of the agents always at his command whenever
he chose to amuse himself with an intrigue.</p>

<p><said>It seems to me, Barbara, that Ralstone hasn't given
you up,</said> said he, his manner softening. <said>Until he
tells you so himself all hope isn't lost.</said></p>

<p><said>All hope? What have I to do with hope so far as
Jack Ralstone is concerned? I've as little desire to
marry him as he has to marry me.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I can see you're a pair of simpletons. I have to
say this to you—you <emph>must</emph> marry him.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara flushed angrily.</p>

<p><said>I shall do nothing of the kind. Not even if he
were to beg my forgiveness for his intolerable insolence.
And let me tell you, Phineas, that I'm not accustomed
to be told that I <emph>must</emph> do this or that.</said></p>

<p><said>You'll probably have to get used to the process.
You've had one lesson in discipline from your father
and you're having another now from me. I repeat you
<pb n="99"/>
<emph>must</emph> marry Ralstone. It's the only chance left to you
to escape your embarrassments.</said></p>

<p><said>There's but one embarrassment which really troubles
me—the threat of that odious Matthews. You can save
me from that. You have but to satisfy her.</said></p>

<p><said>And if I don't choose to do so? What then?</said></p>

<p><said>You would not be so heartless—so dishonourable.
The debt is as much yours as mine,</said> cried Lady Barbara,
her lower lip pouting and tremulous.</p>

<p><said>The debt, yes. But not the consequences. I've no
reputation to lose; every shred has long vanished.
But you, Lady Barbara Dacre, the daughter of the
Duke of Endsleigh! And in your first season too! It
would be nothing if you had been hardened by the fire
of scandal like many fashionable women I could name.
It would be nothing if you were married. Women
excuse wives who seek the consolation and amusement
they don't get from their husbands. But they haven't a
word of excuse for the innocent <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="roman">débutante</foreign>. The most
terrible blunder a woman can make is to blunder at the
start of her career.</said></p>

<p><said>And that's your answer.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara's tremor of the lip extended to her
whole body. She was suffering intolerable torture
under the man's cynical callousness.</p>

<p><said>That's my answer and it's given in your own
interest.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, you men are monsters,</said> she gasped. <said>I
thought my father was cruel, but you're worse—a
thousand times worse. I wish I'd never spoken to you
—never seen you. I hate you.</said></p>

<p><said>No you don't. You're just making a wry face and
whimpering because you have to swallow an unpleasant
pill. You're a beautiful woman, Barbara, but as yet
you don't know how to make yourself fascinating.
That knowledge will come. What is the whole duty of
man? To be fooled by woman. It's her greatest
triumph. To some it comes naturally. To others—
well, they learn it by bitter experience.</said></p>

<p><said>It's shameful to be compelled to sit here and listen
to your atrocious sentiments.</said></p>

<pb n="100"/>

<p><said>My dear Barbara, the truth often sounds atrocious,
but it's the truth nevertheless. Just think. How
many of the rich young fools, and old ones too for the
matter of that, will look at you after our long <foreign xml:lang="fr">tête-à-
tête</foreign>? Nearly one o'clock. We've been sitting here a
good half-hour.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara started. The consequences of the
compromising situation in which she had involved
herself by her long talk with the notorious Sir Phineas
Tenbury flashed across her mind. She had been so
absorbed. The crisis in her life which had so suddenly
arisen had taken so firm a hold upon her that the
minutes had sped by unnoticed. Couples had entered
the tea-room and had departed. Dowagers and
chaperons, eyeing everybody, could not have failed to
notice her and her companion, and were bound to draw
their own conclusions. The terrible thought that Sir
Phineas had purposely invited scandal convulsed her.
She cast a glance at his face. It was as hard as flint.
She sat mute, a prey to agonising self-reproaches. She
listened to her companion, unable to utter a word.</p>

<p><said>I'll make you an offer,</said> he was saying. <said>Win back
young Ralstone. You can do it if you choose to
fascinate him. The difference with old Halstead will
then be smoothed over without the slightest difficulty.
I know all about the dowry the old man had promised
you. With Ralstone as your husband you'll have
plenty of money to spend, and life will go as easily as
an old tune. Do this, my charmer, and that harpy
Matthews will trouble you no more.</said></p>

<p><said>And you, Phineas? Do you fling me aside?</said> she
forced herself to say.</p>

<p><said>Not at all. We shall be just as we have been—
just as we are now,</said> he returned composedly.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara shuddered. She understood. It was
an infamous bargain, but what was she to do?</p>

<p><said>Well?</said> he asked, after a long pause.</p>

<p><said>You are merciless,</said> she faltered slowly. <said>I feel
bound hand and foot. Have your way.</said></p>

<head type="main">A Gala Night at the Fives Court</head>

<p><said>What's to be done, Walsham?</said></p>

<p><said>Nothing but wait. You're not in a particular
hurry, I suppose, to be killed or to kill your man.</said></p>

<p><said>No, but I should like to get it over and done with.
How long will Lord Houston be away?</said></p>

<p>The young nobleman shrugged his shoulders and
laughed.</p>

<p><said>An impossible question to answer, my dear fellow.
Houston's gone off to Paris with a pretty dancer from
the ballet at the King's Theatre, and won't be back
while she continues to amuse him.</said></p>

<p><said>Tenbury could appoint another second,</said> said Ral-
stone, sipping his port slowly.</p>

<p><said>Of course he could, but from what I hear he won't—
that is, not while he owes you money.</said></p>

<p><said>Is he so anxious to pay his debts of honour?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, that kind is the only honour he possesses.
<foreign>Noblesse oblige</foreign>, you know. He told a friend of mine
the other day that if he ran you through while the debt
existed, it would be said he did it because he wanted to
creep out of discharging it.</said></p>

<p><said>H'm, he said that, did he?</said> responded Ralstone,
musingly. <said>Looks as if he intended to choose swords
when the time comes for the affair.</said></p>

<p><said>It would be very unusual. Swords are out of
fashion for duels, although they are still used on the
Continent.</said></p>

<p><said>Possibly, but I fancy a bullet can be as fatal as a
rapier point.</said></p>

<p><said>No doubt. But a chivalrous person can exercise
his privilege of firing in the air if his man misses him.
Whereas, all things being equal, when you're fencing you
go on. You can't afford to be generous unless you're
very much the better man and you can disarm your
opponent. But what makes you think Tenbury will
choose swords?</said></p>

<pb n="102"/>

<p><said>The first cause of offence was my beating him at a
fencing bout at Castellani's. I don't say I handle the
foils better than Tenbury—I should say there are very
few things he has to learn that way—but he was
devilish careless—made too sure, you know—and let
me in. He's not likely to do that a second time.</said></p>

<p>Lord Walsham silently puffed at his <q>segar.</q> The
two were in the coffee-room of the <q>Tavistock,</q> having
steadily ploughed their way through mock turtle, cod
and oyster sauce, roast beef, a bird, and apple tart—
the orthodox hotel menu.</p>

<p><said>It's no affair of mine, Jack, of course, but it helps a
second to take the right line when he knows what his
principal is quarrelling about. If it's only a trifle, you
see, the door's open to a compromise. I see no sense
in getting shot or pinked to satisfy a punctilio of
honour.</said></p>

<p><said>Nor I. I thought I hinted to you that the real
cause of difference was over a woman.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, I've learned as much as that and no more.
Are you in love with her?</said></p>

<p><said>The deuce only knows. I don't.</said></p>

<p><said>Then it isn't about Lady Barbara Dacre?</said></p>

<p><said>No. So far as Lady Barbara's concerned, <emph>that</emph>
affair's off.</said></p>

<p><said>The devil it is. You made her jealous, I suppose,
over—the other woman.</said></p>

<p><said>You're wrong. The boot's on the other leg. Lady
Barbara seemed disposed to play fast and loose, so I
gave her her head, and we haven't seen each other since,
and I doubt if we're likely to.</said></p>

<p>Lord Walsham permitted himself to indulge in a low,
prolonged and decidedly plebeian whistle.</p>

<p><said>That accounts for it then,</said> said he, as though
talking to himself.</p>

<p><said>Accounts for what?</said></p>

<p><said>Why, for what Georgie Nye—Beau Nye he's called,
you know—told me at White's this afternoon. Nye's
so inveterate a retailer of scandal, and such an infernal
liar. I didn't believe him. But it would seem that for
once in his life he may have spoken the truth. He was
<pb n="103"/>
at Almack's last night, and he swears he saw Lady
Barbara Dacre and Tenbury sitting in the tea-room for
over half an hour and they did nothing but whisper,
quite blind and deaf to all that was going on around
them. George thought from Lady Barbara's clouded
face that something like a quarrel had happened. It
couldn't have been very serious. Anyhow, apparently
they made it up, for they waltzed together when they
returned to the ball-room. Whatever the meaning,
Lady Barbara seems to have been somewhat indiscreet.
With any other man but Tenbury it wouldn't have
mattered a jot. Of course I shouldn't have told you
a word of this if you hadn't said the engagement was
broken.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone winced. Although he had ceased to think
of Lady Barbara as his <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="roman">fiancée</foreign>, it was not pleasant to
hear how soon she had consoled herself for her loss. Yet
it ought hardly to surprise him. She had shown a
decided preference for Sir Phineas at the Bath mas-
querade, and Sir Phineas had not failed to pursue his
advantage.</p>

<p><said>It's no affair of mine,</said> he growled. <said>She's at
liberty to do as she likes.</said></p>

<p><said>And you also. I imagine I ought to congratulate
you. The Duke of Endsleigh's as poor as a church
mouse and now that you expect nothing from <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Halstead, you don't want to saddle yourself with a
woman of fashion with not a penny for her to dress
upon and gamble with. I hope you've fixed your fancy
on a rich heiress. Tenbury's not the man to bother
about a woman unless she's wealthy and belongs to the
<foreign xml:lang="fr">beau monde</foreign>. He recognises no other.</said></p>

<p><said>My dear Walsham, there's no rule without an
exception, but it's not a question of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">beau monde</foreign> in
this case. To tell you the truth I haven't the slightest
idea to what world the woman belongs. I've only seen
her once, and I'd give the universe, if I had it, to see
her again, but she's vanished into thin air.</said></p>

<p><said>And you're going to fight about her?</said> asked
Walsham, elevating his eyebrows.</p>

<p>Jack Ralstone nodded.</p>

<pb n="104"/>

<p><said>Then all I've got to say is that you must be con-
foundedly in love with her.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone made no reply. He was staring moodily at
the crimson papered wall opposite him.</p>

<p><said>You're damned quixotic, Jack Ralstone, and—if
you'll permit me to say so—damned foolish.</said></p>

<p><said>Add that I'm damned romantic, and you'll have
the list of adjectives complete.</said></p>

<p><said>Not bad credentials to start with. If you want to
be noticed you must be talked about. Women don't
mind a scandal attaching to a man. In fact, they
rather like it. Corinthians are privileged, but you
must do something out of the common to justify your
existence.</said></p>

<p><said>Knock down a <q>Charley</q> and shut him up in his
own box, for instance,</said> said Jack ironically.</p>

<p><said>That kind of notoriety's played out. It's a bit
low. Your fighting a duel for a woman you've only
seen once, and never likely to see again, is tip top. It
ought to make your fortune. See here, Ralstone. Give
me <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="roman">carte blanche</foreign> to tell this love story of yours, with
judicious embellishments, and a few mysterious winks
thrown in, to give the thing the proper <q>Castle
Spectre</q> mystery, and I'll wager you'll have half a
dozen women of fortune at your feet within a week.
I'm not joking.</said></p>

<p><said>So I should hope. The matter's far too serious for
a joke. You'll oblige me very much if you'll keep your
mouth shut. I shouldn't have told you if I thought
you were going to carry it over the town.</said></p>

<p><said>Of course, if that's the case, I'm mum. But what's
your game? You've been flashing your coin as if you
were living in <q>Tip Street</q>—that's the correct cant
term, I believe, for plenty of money—and as you've con-
fessed to me you've no resources beyond what you won
over Spring and Neate, you'll soon be at Point Nonplus.
Tenbury's payment's very doubtful. Have you had
Weare's coin yet?</said></p>

<p><said>No—the scoundrel, and I doubt if I shall get it.
But I'm not bothering about money just now. I'm
going to the Fives Court to-night. Tom Spring has a
<pb n="105"/>
benefit and I'm bound to support him. Will you join
me?</said></p>

<p><said>With pleasure. And go on to White's afterwards
for a flutter! What say you?</said></p>

<p><said>I don't care. Fortune favours the bold,</said> rejoined
Ralstone recklessly.</p>

<p>At that moment he was approaching perilously near
the end of his resources. A month had gone over since
he left Bristol, and he had been living in much the same
manner as when enjoying Simon Halstead's liberal
allowance. If anything, he had spent more. He had
won a little at Ascot, and again at a cock fight in Tot-
hill's Fields, Westminster, but it had gone almost as
soon as he had pocketed it. With Tenbury's £4,000 he
would be in clover, but this had not been forthcoming.
Meanwhile, his tailor and his glover were beginning to
be clamorous. But the anxiety of these gentry was
not troubling him to-night.</p>

<p>The Fives Court in St. Martin's Street, Leicester
Square, was but little more than five minutes' walk
from the <q>Tavistock.</q> Not worth while to take a
hackney coach, and the two friends sauntered out.</p>

<p><said>What's the matter?</said> asked Walsham.</p>

<p>Ralstone had not gone a couple of yards from the
private entrance of the hotel in James Street when he
stopped for an instant as though he had forgotten
something.</p>

<p><said>Go on,</said> said he in a low voice, <said>but glance at the
man opposite standing at the corner of the arcade.
Don't let him think you're looking at him.</said></p>

<p>Jack slid his arm within his companion's and the
action brought Walsham slightly round so that he was
able to direct his eyes across the street naturally.</p>

<p><said>Well,</said> said Walsham, when they had resumed their
walk. <said>I've obeyed you. What then?</said></p>

<p><said>Have you ever seen the fellow before?</said></p>

<p><said>No.</said></p>

<p><said>Would you know him again?</said></p>

<p><said>I think so.</said></p>

<p><said>What does he look like to you?</said></p>
<pb n="106"/>

<p><said>A slinking-eyed, crafty scoundrel, ready to do any
dirty work for a guinea.</said></p>

<p><said>That's my opinion too. I've caught the blackguard
waiting at that corner a dozen times or so. I've seen
him at places where I've been—the theatres and so on,
and I've a shrewd suspicion he's followed me more than
once, though I can't swear to it—the beggar's as slippery
as an eel. What does it mean?</said></p>

<p><said>How the deuce can I tell? If what you say is true,
he means you some ill. You'd better keep your eyes
open when you're going through the market at night.
The place is villainously lighted and full of dark
corners. As for the unwashed mob, men and women—
and I'm not sure the women aren't worse than the men
—always lurking about after dark, well, you know as
much about them as I do. Let half a dozen set upon
you and they'd strip you of everything and maybe
leave you half dead before the watchmen are awake.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm not afraid of the mob. I fancy I could give
them as good as they gave, but this man's game isn't
robbery. And the odd thing is that I'm sure I've seen
him before somewhere—I mean before I put up at the
<q>Tavistock.</q> It isn't so much his ill-favoured mug
that's impressed on my memory, as a peculiar bend in
his shoulders—the sort of bend that belongs to a sneak.</said></p>

<p><said>I know what you mean—the cringing, crawling,
snaky sort of chap. And you can't fix where you saw
him first?</said></p>

<p><said>Not precisely, but I believe if I heard his voice it
would help me.</said></p>

<p><said>Anyhow, that's easy. You've but to ask him why
the devil he's watching the hotel and you'd know.</said></p>

<p><said>That would be a stupid blunder—that is, if he's
really spying upon me, as I firmly believe he is. I shall
let him have rope enough and when the time comes
strike and strike and strike hard.</said></p>

<p><said>I shan't give him much chance,</said> said Walsham,
laughingly. <said>The fellow doesn't look as if he were any
good at fighting.</said></p>

<p><said>It wouldn't matter if he were. It's not the
scoundrel himself I want to get at but the people behind
<pb n="107"/>
him. It's absurd to suppose a shabby wretch like that
can have any grudge against me.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, it's all to the good,</said> remarked the young lord
with an air of profound wisdom.</p>

<p><said>All to the good? What the deuce do you mean?</said></p>

<p><said>My dear Ralstone, can't you see if anything serious
comes of this mystery man, it'll help to bring you into
the fierce light that beats upon people of <foreign xml:lang="fr">ton</foreign>. I'm bent
upon marrying you to a rich woman and notoriety's the
first step.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't care a hang for notoriety nor a rich woman
either. I've something else in my mind, though I doubt
if my dream will ever become a reality.</said></p>

<p><said>It's a dream, is it? Then you're more foolish than
I take you to be. But here we are.</said></p>

<p>A crowd of rough-looking, dirty-faced men, some with
the broken noses, the high cheek bones and the square
ugly chins of the born fighter, were struggling through
the entrance to the Fives Court, bellowing for no
particular reason save the effects of the gin and porter
they had swallowed, and exchanging coarse chaff.</p>

<p><said>Can't say much for your friend Spring's admirers.
A greasy mob,</said> whispered Walsham, with a look of
disgust. The young lord had more fancy for cards than
for boxing.</p>

<p><said>Oh, they're not all Spring's admirers. A heap of
well-known bruisers are here to-night and each one's
got his crowd of backers. These P.R. men are little
gods. It's a mixed entertainment to-night. Any man
who's fought in the ring for over £25 can have a set to.
Whether he wins or loses he'll have a guinea and a
supper afterwards at Cribb's pub, Panton Street.
Besides the admission money there'll be whatever sum
we Corinthians. as we've been dubbed, choose to sub-
scribe. You're not of the noble order of <soCalled>millers</soCalled>
Walsham, but here you are and you'll have to put your
hand in your pocket, so I warn you.</said></p>

<p><said>Very good. I'm not frightened,</said> rejoined Walsham
nonchalantly. <said>I won't even ask where the money's
going.</said></p>

<p><said>You may if you like. It's to pay for the guineas
<pb n="108"/>
and the supper, and when those expenses are squared
the residue is to purchase a presentation silver cup for
Tom. Spring, you know, by beating Neate, is the
champion of England.</said></p>

<p><said>I've no objection. Spring's a decent fellow. But,
Ralstone, are we expected to rub shoulders with those
brass-throated ruffians? One fellow who gave me a
shove as he squeezed by must have come from a Smith-
field slaughterhouse. I declare I could smell the blood
and fat.</said></p>

<p><said>That's very likely. Jack's as good as his master
here,</said> laughed Ralstone. <said>I'll take you to the proper
entrance for the swells.</said></p>

<p>The door was down a narrow passage and here stood
half a dozen sturdy fellows on guard, in the event of
any sudden rush of the dregs of the crowd eager to see
the show without the trouble of paying. Jack was well
known to the <soCalled>fancy</soCalled> and he and Walsham were
received with the utmost respect, especially as each
planked down a guinea for admission.</p>

<p>The Fives Court was a big building, circular in shape,
with a platform in the centre for the boxers. It was
packed to suffocation. The air was hot and stifling,
partly from want of ventilation, partly from acrid
tobacco smoke, but mostly from the foul clothes of the
audience and the odour of stale drink. Beer cans were
being freely passed about.</p>

<p>A place had been reserved for the <soCalled>nobs</soCalled> and Ral-
stone and his friend were warmly welcomed by the
heroes Cribb and Spring. Bill Neate, the defeated one
at the Andover fight, was also there, his arm in a sling,
and he pricked up his ears when he heard Ralstone's
name. He chanced to be close by.</p>

<p><said>Excuse me taking the liberty, sir, but bean't you
from the Holbrook Manor House—Squire Halstead's
place?</said> said he, with his finger to his forehead.</p>

<p><said>Yes, but I'm not living there now,</said> said Jack.</p>

<p><said>So I heered from Steve Carne, the Squire's groom.
I had a glass wi' Steve about a week or so after the mill
an' he bid me say to 'ee, sir, if so be as a comed across
<pb n="109"/>
'ee in London, as the Squire's been main queer since your
honour left the Manor House.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh? What ails him?</said></p>

<p><said>That's what's worrying Steve. The old gentleman's
took it to heart your going away, but it bean't that,
Steve says, as is the trouble. Something's happened
but Steve don't know what. He lifted his right arm
pretty often when you was no longer in the house—you
know what I mean, sir—rum, that's his fav'rite tipple
—an' he was a bit upset over my losin' the champion-
ship—had a few hunderds on me, though that oughtn't
to hurt him, chock full as is his money bags—but it's
something else as has changed him.</said></p>

<p><said>Something else, Neate? What do you mean?</said></p>

<p><said>Can't tell 'ee, sir, cause Stephen didn't know. But
it seems he went out for a walk and comed back lookin'
very white and all of a tremble like. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Coombes,
the cook and keeper, thought as how he was ill, an'
begged him to send for <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Jevons, but he cursed her
fur a fool up hill an' down dale, and shut himself up
in his room wi' a bottle o' rum. He's been on the
booze—saving your presence, sir—ever since, an' <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Coombes says he never goes to bed wi'out a pair o'
loaded barkers under his pillow. She's afeard as he'll
do himself some harm wi' 'em some day. He bean't
fit to handle firearms.</said></p>

<p>Jack heard all this with concern, but he wasn't sur-
prised. His stepfather often had long drinking bouts
when out of temper, and this doubtless was one of them.
But the cause? Probably <choice><corr>disappointment</corr><orig>diappointment</orig></choice> at the
failure of his scheme concerning Lady Barbara Dacre.
If so, what could Ralstone do? Nothing. After what
Walsham had told him about Lady Barbara and Sir
Phineas at Almack's anything like a reconciliation
between him and the lady was impossible. All he could
say to Neate was that he was sorry.</p>

<p><said>Steve told me,</said> went on Neate hesitatingly, <said>that
it were a pity your honour couldn't come down and see
the Squire, as he b'lieves the old man 'ud make it up wi'
'ee if so be as 'ee didn't rub him the wrong way—askin'
<pb n="110"/>
your pardon for sayin' so. I give my word to Steve to
tell 'ee and so I have.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm much obliged, Neate. I'll think over what
you've said.</said></p>

<p>Neate's finger went up to his forehead and the talk
ended. Jack wasn't much disturbed. He was not at
all disposed to conciliate his stepfather because he knew
it would have to be on conditions he was not prepared
to submit to. The thing which puzzled him was the
Squire's sudden fit of fright; for this was the only
explanation of keeping loaded pistols in his bed-
chamber. Yet Simon Halstead was not easily fright-
ened. Often and often, when in his cups and in his
passion, he had sworn that he feared neither God nor
the devil, let alone any man on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Ralstone's thoughts were suddenly put an end to by
catching sight of the man whom he suspected of watch-
ing him. The fellow was in the shadow, his back
against the wall and his peaked cap drawn well over
his eyes. Only the lower part of the face was visible.
But it was the man. That peculiar, cringing stoop of
the shoulders revealed him. Of course, the fellow's
presence might be merely a coincidence. Certainly he
had a perfect right to be present if he were so minded.
But all the same it was disquieting.</p>

<p><said>You know most of the crowd here, Spring, I
suspect,</said> said he to the champion.</p>

<p><said>Pretty well, sir. They're mostly the scourings of
Tom Belcher's house. the <q>Castle,</q> Cribb's place in
Panton Street, and my own pub in Weymouth Street.</said></p>

<p><said>What about that man with the cap over his eyes?
Who's he?</said></p>

<p><said>Never saw him before. Doesn't look as if he'd ever
had a turn up in his life.</said></p>

<p><said>No—a sort of chap who's more used to being
kicked.</said></p>

<p><said>What's he done? Robbed you, sir? Pocket-
picking's his lay, I'll bet.</said></p>

<p><said>Very likely. But it's of no consequence.</said></p>

<p>Spring turned away. The fun had commenced. A
couple of well-known boxers had stepped upon the
<pb n="111"/>
platform amid the yells of their respective friends, and
commenced to spar. Of course, they were not in
earnest. It was but a show to amuse the crowd. A
few rounds were fought, then the combatants gave
place to another couple, who in their turn retired after
a bout or two. And so the entertainment went on.
Then came shouts for Spring. He and Cribb were
expected to have a set to, but these accomplished
gladiators were not able to display their accomplish-
ment. Spring, who spoke to Lord Walsham's surprise
with grammatical correctness and with a refinement
of tone quite exceptional among the <q>fancy,</q> explained
that his hands were tender—it was his only defect as a
fighter—otherwise he would have been glad to oblige.</p>

<p>Tom paid a compliment to Bill Neate for his
gallantry in the fight for the championship, and this
brought his old antagonist to his feet. Neate explained
that his arm was broken some time in the third round,
and of course thus crippled he could not be expected
to win. Sympathising shouts greeted this statement,
mingled with incredulous scoffs from two or three of
Spring's devotees, who had dipped too deeply in the
beer can.</p>

<p>Cribb at this point announced that while the receipts
were ample to provide the necessary guineas, and the
supper to follow, they did not suffice to purchase a cup
worthy of the champion's acceptance. The cap would
therefore go round. Cribb was no orator, but he went
straight to the point, and as he knew the majority of
the spectators wanted the money in their pockets for
<q>heavy wet</q> and <q>max,</q> he made a direct appeal to
the Corinthians present.</p>

<p><said>Bravo, Tom,</said> shouted Ralstone. <said>Here's five
guineas.</said> The crowd yelled with delight. Lord
Walsham followed with a similar offer. Renewed yells.
The other <soCalled>swells</soCalled> were not behindhand and Cribb
was about to announce the sum collected when there
was a movement in the packed room. Heads swayed,
bodies were jerked this way and that, it was like the
stirring up of a muddy pool.</p>

<p>Presently a big athletic, black-haired, clean shaven
<pb n="112"/>
fellow, his face flushed, his eyes bleary, his dress dis-
ordered, forced his way through the growling mob to
the platform.</p>

</div>


<div n="11" type="chapter">

<head type="main">A Fight not in the Programme</head>

<p><said>It's Jack Thurtell,</said> whispered a man next Ralstone.
<said>What devil's game is he up to? Wherever he shows
his head a shindy generally follows. He's out for a
row. He's as drunk as drunk can be.</said></p>

<p>This was pretty evident. Thurtell was gripping the
edge of the platform to steady himself. There was an
ugly look in his deep-set eyes which meant mischief.
His glance fixed on Ralstone.</p>

<p><said>I believe you call yourself a Corinthian,</said> he shouted
thickly. <said>You——</said></p>

<p><said>No, I don't. You may call me one if you like,</said>
broke in Ralstone, answering the glitter in Thurtell's
eyes with contempt and defiance written in his own.</p>

<p><said>I'll call you something else if you give me any of
your sauce,</said> retorted Thurtell insolently.</p>

<p>Ralstone would have started to his feet, and some-
thing like a free fight might have followed, but Walsham
pinned him down, and Cribb, eager to protect his noble
patrons and preserve order, advanced to the edge of the
platform.</p>

<p><said>None of your insults, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thurtell. You ought to
know better. If you can't behave yourself, there's
plenty here who can teach you. Now then, what do
you want?</said></p>

<p><said>I'll tell you in two-twos, if you'll give me a hearing.
I know how to behave myself in any company, from a
Royal Levee to a boozing ken. If I've said anything
to offend you, Tom Cribb, I apologise. You're one of
the finest and biggest hearted men that ever stepped.</said></p>

<p><said>Then don't forget that when you insult any of my
friends you insult me. Now what <emph>is</emph> it you want?</said></p>

<p><said>Just this. The Tulips have planked down a paltry
<pb n="113"/>
five guineas, led by their bell-wether. I'll double that
and here's the brass.</said></p>

<p>He pulled out a handful of coin and counted out ten,
each coin jumping a foot high as he rang them on the
boards.</p>

<p><said>Of course, I'm much obliged to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thurtell, but
we'd ha' liked it better if he'd been a bit more polite,</said>
said Cribb, not over delighted. Thurtell, who ran a
public-house in Long Acre, had a bad reputation, and
it was doubtful if the money had been honestly come by.
<said>I'm not sure whether I want your guineas. We've
got enough to buy a good cup.</said></p>

<p><said>Take the coin and buy a better one,</said> roared
Thurtell. <said>I know what's in your mind. Let me tell
you it's clean money. Perhaps you don't know that
I've won my action to-day against that thief Barber
Beaumont and his swindling Insurance Company. A
£1,000 damages! A cool £1,000! Isn't that so, boys?</said></p>

<p>He wheeled round and hurled the question at the
mob.</p>

<p><said>Quite true, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thurtell,</said> <said>Good old Terrible
Jack!</said> and a few more affirmations, more or less
strengthened by lurid adjectives, came from different
parts of the room. Thurtell had evidently brought a
strong party with him. As a matter of fact he had
been flinging his money about in the adjacent taverns
ever since the jury had decided in his favour over a
claim for the insurance of a house in his possession
which had been burnt down—a claim which the company
had disputed.</p>

<p>Tom Cribb did not argue the point. He picked up
the coins, and handed them to another member of the
P.R. who was acting as treasurer.</p>

<p><said>Now then, boys,</said> went on Thurtell in a stentorian
voice, <said>would you like to see some real fun? You've
had enough of the pugs. What about a set to between
gentlemen? I challenge the young <q>Pink</q> over there.</said></p>

<p>He shot his finger out towards Jack Ralstone.</p>

<p><said>That's not in the list. I'm in the chair here,</said> said
Cribb, stolidly, <said>and I'm not going to have it.</said></p>

<pb n="114"/>

<p>Ralstone was on his feet in a flash, to the horror of
Lord Walsham.</p>

<p><said>I'd like to obey your order, Cribb,</said> said he, very
cool and resolute, <said>but I've been challenged, and if I
say nothing it will be thought I'm afraid. Now, I
don't care that, for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thurtell.</said></p>

<p>He snapped his fingers, and the shouts of applause
shook the rafters. <q>He's a game 'un,</q> <q>Let the
swells have a turn</q>—<q>Two to one on the Pink</q>—
<q>Three to one on Jack Thurtell</q>—were heard amid
the babel of sounds.</p>

<p>Cribb talked for a few moments with Spring, and by
their glances it was clear that Jack Ralstone was the
subject of their conference. Meanwhile the raucous
voices of the mob made everything inaudible. Spring
came across to Ralstone.</p>

<p><said>Are you in earnest, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone?</said> said he.</p>

<p><said>Of course I am. I had a little mill with the bully
at Andover, just after you knocked Neate out of time,
and I downed him. This is a planned thing to get his
own back. All right, I mean to spoil the plan.</said></p>

<p><said>But I can't quite make it out. How did Thurtell
know you would be here?</said></p>

<p><said>He didn't know. It was coincidence. At least,
I think so. But &#x2026;</said></p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to Ralstone that Thurtell's
presence might be due to the fellow whom he suspected
of spying upon him. Here might be the key of the
mystery. But it was not wholly satisfactory, and, in
fact, only feasible on the supposition that the spy had
been in touch with Thurtell all day long, and knew
where to send to him after his victory, no matter where
he might be carousing. It was not impossible, but cer-
tainly improbable.</p>

<p><said>Well, what about it, Tom,</said> went on Ralstone im-
patiently. <said>Has Cribb any objection?</said></p>

<p><said>He doesn't care for the exhibition, but he doesn't
oppose it.</said></p>

<p><said>That's settled then. See here, Spring, I'm not going
to let that boasting bully's taunt about the subscriptions
<pb n="115"/>
go unanswered. I shall give £10 more towards your
cup.</said></p>

<p><said>You're a thorough gentleman, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone, and a
thorough sportsman,</said> cried Spring heartily, <said>and I
thank you. But you've done quite enough without
your generous offer.</said></p>

<p><said>Say no more. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cribb——</said></p>

<p>Tom Cribb crossed the platform at the sound of
Jack's voice, and his eyes beamed with pleasure when
he heard of the proposed addition to the fund.</p>

<p><said>It's very generous of you, sir, and I shall be pleased
to announce it. I was beginning to be sorry I accepted
Thurtell's money. I should have felt ashamed if an
outsider and a rogue topped the list over you Corinth-
ians. You've scored a higher throw, and the thing's
done.</said></p>

<p><said>And the match?</said> demanded Jack eagerly.</p>

<p>Cribb's experienced eyes went over Jack Ralstone's
vigorous, well-balanced body, noted the deep chest, the
length of arm, the glow of perfect health, and the firm
lips and bold chin, the fearless eyes, and turned to
Spring.</p>

<p><said>What do you say, Tom? Has <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone a
chance? Thurtell's a hard hitter, I'm told.</said></p>

<p><said>He can hit as hard as he likes, but he's got to get
home,</said> said Spring dryly. <said>I've seen <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone in
the buff, and I've had the gloves on with him, and he's
about as nimble on his pins as I am. It's Lombard
Street to a chiney orange on <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone. And he's
in fine fettle. too. He's practised every morning at
Jackson's rooms since he's been in London. Isn't that
so, sir, and you've had your bit o' fun at night, too.
If you don't overdo it, letting yourself go once in a way
doesn't hurt. Keeps you from training too fine, and
being anxious. You want to keep the devil in you in
readiness when you call upon him.</said></p>

<p><said>That's a devilish good way of putting it, Tom
Spring,</said> laughed Jack. <said>Better to call upon the devil
to come to you than go to the devil, eh?</said></p>

<p><said>That's a good 'un, sir,</said> said Cribb, with a grim
smile. <said>Look here, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone, I've got an idee.
<pb n="116"/>
Instead of your handing over your ten shiners free,
gratis, and for nothing, s'pose I tell 'em that you'll give
the coin if you win. Fightin' or sparrin' for love——</said></p>

<p><said>I'm hanged if it's love in the case, Cribb,</said> inter-
rupted Jack.</p>

<p><said>Maybe not, sir, but the argyment's the same. What
I says is that to fight in earnest you must have some-
thing to go after, just like a game o' cards. Cards is
nothing without a stake.</said></p>

<p><said>Have it your own way, Tom. But if the fellow
says he'll give the same if he wins, what'll you do?
You can't in fairness refuse.</said></p>

<p>This was a poser, and Cribb put on his considering
cap.</p>

<p><said>I s'pose that is so,</said> said he at last. <said>Well, I'll tell
you what I'll do if it's agreeable to you. I won't say a
word about your ten guineas until the rounds are over.
If you win I shall then announce the thing.</said></p>

<p><said>And if I lose?</said></p>

<p><said>I shall keep my mouth shut, and you'll keep your
money in your pocket.</said></p>

<p><said>No, I don't like that. The money was to go to the
cup in any case. You know what you said about your
not wanting Thurtell to top the list.</said></p>

<p><said>Aye, and I say it still. You'll win, take my word
for it. I know a born fighter when I see one, but it'll
have to be as I say. I'm the M.C. on this here
occasion.</said></p>

<p>Jack saw that Cribb was determined, and he said
no more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the crowd was becoming restive. The
desire to see a mill between <soCalled>swells</soCalled> had bitten deep
into their souls. They would have much preferred it
to be without gloves, but this wasn't at all likely.
Thurtell was egging them on, and indulging in coarse
pleasantry. He was standing defiantly, his legs wide
apart, his hands in his trousers pockets.</p>

<p><said>When you've finished giving the <soCalled>Pink</soCalled> your tips,
Cribb, I'm ready for him. How much do you and
Spring charge for your lessons?</said></p>

<p>There was a roar of laughter at this.</p>

<pb n="117"/>

<p>Cribb stepped to the edge of the platform, and stared
at Thurtell.</p>

<p><said><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone will give you <emph>your</emph> lesson, <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Thurtell,</said> said he, without moving a muscle of his
stolid face.</p>

<p>Another burst of laughter, heartier and more sten-
torian than the former, and yelling, stamping of feet
and sticks, and clapping of hands followed when the
ex-champion invited Thurtell to step up on the platform.</p>

<p><said>I suppose you don't mean to back out,</said> Cribb
added dryly.</p>

<p><said>Back out!</said> roared Thurtell, his face aflame.
<said>What the devil do you mean, Cribb?</said></p>

<p><said>You understand well enough, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thurtell, if you
haven't forgotten your appearance in this here very
Fives Court, and Tom Belcher.</said></p>

<p>A sudden silence fell upon the crowd. The majority
knew what Cribb referred to. Thurtell had always
posed not merely as a patron of the prize ring, but as
a boxer as well. He had a certain amount of skill,
but a much greater amount of vanity, and a few years
before he had had the temerity to challenge Belcher to
fight for £500 a side, and being flush of money actually
deposited his stake. It was thought to be a bluff, and
Belcher, a short time after, observing Thurtell at the
Fives Court, mounted the stage, and asked for <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Thurtell's attention.</p>

<p><said>I've given up prize fighting,</said> said Tom, <said>but if
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thurtell will come up here I'll set to with the gloves
with him for anything he likes, and he that takes the
gloves off first shall be considered the loser.</said></p>

<p>Thurtell said not a word, and he lost his reputation
for courage among decent boxers from that moment.</p>

<p>It was clear that Cribb's sarcastic reminder went
home. For a moment Thurtell's truculent look van-
ished, but it soon returned.</p>

<p><said>An idle tale,</said> he retorted contemptuously. <said>Have
you told that piece of silly gossip to put me off? If
so, you'll find yourself mistaken, and yonder Tulip
also.</said></p>

<p>And with that he vaulted to the stage, and striding
<pb n="118"/>
towards Neate asked him to act as his second. Neate
assented.</p>

<p>The preliminaries were soon settled. Two rounds
and no more was the dictum, and the two combatants,
stripped to their shirts and trousers, rolled up their
sleeves, and their seconds fastened on the gloves.
Neither observed the usual preface, the shaking of
hands to denote there was no ill-feeling. Then they
faced each other.</p>

<p>Tom Spring was Jack Ralstone's second, and had
warned the impetuous young man to keep himself well
in hand, and play the waiting game.</p>

<p><said>He's a rusher, and an ill-tempered one into the
bargain. It's your fight, if you keep cool and watch
your chance. Directly he misses one of his heavy
blows he's done for. See that he <emph>does</emph> miss.</said></p>

<p>The boxers contrasted strongly. They were about
the same height, but Thurtell was the heavier. If it
should come to a wrestle, and Jack was thrown with
Thurtell on the top, as he would try to be, it might
mean a broken rib. Ralstone was some years younger,
and the model of youthful symmetry, but he looked a
mere stripling by the side of the burly Thurtell. Jack's
attitude was perfectly correct. That of Thurtell was
clumsy, and in the opinion of the expert he held his
fists awkwardly.</p>

<p>The two advanced, circled round each other, Thurtell
crouching somewhat, his fists low as if challenging
Ralstone to strike at his unguarded face. Jack, how-
ever, was in no hurry. He wanted his antagonist to
show his tactics. As a boxer with some smattering of
professionalism, Thurtell probably had some favourite
dodge or blow which would end the fight at an early
stage. It is a failing which many boxers have, who
think themselves cleverer than they really are. A trick,
no matter how ingenious it may be, is still a trick, and
once exhibited it becomes the property of the world.
Another disadvantage is that every trick has its answer,
and that answer is sometimes disastrous for the trickster.</p>

<p>Thurtell had a trick of which he was very proud.
Spring knew all about it, as did other boxers, and he
<pb n="119"/>
uttered a warning against what Jack was bound to
expect sooner or later. Mindful of Spring's words the
young man, while hovering round with the light, elastic
tread of a cat, and ready to move quick as a flash in
any direction, kept his glance fixed on his opponent's
eyes. It seemed to him that they showed a lack of fire,
that the man was not so confident as when he threw out
his boastful challenge. Either the stimulus of drink
was evaporating under the inevitable reaction, or
Cribb's inconvenient reminder was still rankling.</p>

<p>Jack had no intention of attacking Thurtell's un-
guarded face. He preferred gradually to feel his way,
and allow his antagonist to disclose his method. Thur-
tell, it was clear, was not a scientific fighter. He had
not had enough practice with experts, and he had not
the necessary coolness and patience. But he was not
to be despised on that account. The slogger can hit,
and science doesn't always win.</p>

<p>Thurtell soon got tired of Jack's dancing round him,
and having to turn constantly. What is to-day called
<q>leg-work</q> did not suit him. To bring matters to an
issue he suddenly lowered his head, and dashed within
Jack's guard, so that the young fellow's length of reach
should not be of much avail. Jack knew that the trick
blow was coming, and instead of ducking his head as
Thurtell evidently expected, he closed with his opponent
and got his chin over the attacker's shoulder. Thur-
tell's intention was to administer a <q>hammer blow</q>
beneath Jack's chin, but he was not quick enough to get
it in before the target was well out of the way, and his
fist met nothing but empty air.</p>

<p>Thurtell had put all his strength and weight into the
blow, and the impetus almost threw him off his balance
and forced back Jack's body slightly. Before Thurtell
had recovered, Jack had broken away, and delivered
his lightning blows left and right on Thurtell's ribs, one
going perilously near the <q>mark.</q> Thurtell did not
attempt to guard himself—perhaps he did not know
how—and though he was breathing painfully he fol-
lowed his nimble antagonist with the intention of forcing
<pb n="120"/>
him to the ropes, where he might possibly get another
chance of <q>in fighting</q> with better results.</p>

<p>It was to no purpose. Ralstone got in another smart
tap, still on the body, and swerved on one side before
the heavier man could retaliate. This method of fight-
ing did not suit Thurtell's supporters, who jeered and
shouted that the <q>Corinthian</q> hadn't the pluck to take
punishment, but as Ralstone's idea was to <q>give</q> rather
than to <q>take</q> he was unmoved by the outcry.</p>

<p>But it is always the unexpected which happens.
Jack, exulting in the conviction that he had taken the
measure of his man, recklessly ventured within reach
of his opponent's fists on purpose to show his agility
in springing aside. He succeeded cleverly several times,
but, with the over-confidence of youth, did it once
too often. His foot slipping, up came Thurtell's hammer
fist and caught him, not on the point of the chin, but
sufficiently near to stagger him. For one instant a
strange giddiness seized him, and had Thurtell chosen
to repeat the blow he must have been knocked out.
But Thurtell rushed in and they closed in a wrestle.
Thurtell hadn't the slightest doubt that his weight
and muscle would tell, but he hadn't bargained for
the Somersetshire grip in which Jack was proficient.
To the amazement of every one down went the fellow
with a thud which shook the platform. He had been
thrown by a cross buttock and lay for a few seconds
gasping.</p>

<p>The round was finished and in Ralstone's favour.
Thurtell was up to time and renewed his old tactics,
but the fire had gone out of his attack, and his blows
not only had little strength behind them, but fell short.
Ralstone had learned his lesson, and while not less agile,
was more cautious. He was prepared for his antago-
nist's favourite coup, and keeping his chin well down
he seized the chance when it came, feinted with his
right, and suddenly changing his feet, sent in with his
left as straight a blow as boxer ever delivered. It had
in it the whole weight of his body and it caught Thurtell
between the eyes. The man went down like a bullock
under the pole-axe.</p>

<pb n="121"/>

<p>Thurtell was lying like a log. Quite twenty seconds
had gone over before he opened his eyes and stared
stupidly at Neate, who was trying to bring him to.</p>

<p><said>What's all this?</said> he muttered between gasps of
breath.</p>

<p><said>You've lost <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thurtell. I told you not to rush.</said>
Thurtell made no answer. Apparently he did not
quite realise the meaning of Neate's words. But they
sank soon into his sluggish brain, and he made an effort
to rise.</p>

<p><said>I'm not done yet. We'll have another round.
Then you'll see.</said></p>

<p><said>Hold your tongue,</said> retorted Neate roughly.
<said>You're counted out, an' if you wasn't it 'ud be no
good. It's all over.</said></p>

<p>Thurtell rolled his head. The tears started in his
eyes. The mortification was too bitter to be endured
calmly.</p>

<p><said>Get me up,</said> he whimpered chokingly.</p>

<p>Neate and another man raised him to his feet and he
glared around for Ralstone. Jack was standing by
Cribb's side. Cribb was addressing the excited crowd.
The spectators were not all on the side of Ralstone.
There were yells for another round.</p>

<p><said>The set-to's finished 'cordin' to rules,</said> said Cribb.
<said>I've got something more to tell you. I want you to
give a cheer for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jack Ralstone. He's fought fair
and he's a game boxer. But he's more. He's got a
good heart. He told me if he beat the <q>Swell Yokel</q>
he'd hand another ten guineas to the fund, and here
they are.</said></p>

<p>Cribb dropped the coins from his right hand into his
left. The applause was deafening. Thurtell's face
went ashen. This was a fresh humiliation. Neate
helped him to dress. He was cheered as he was assisted
to leave the stage, and was immediately surrounded by
a number of his friends, most of whom, half drunk,
had had at their hero's expense as many pints as
they could swallow previous to coming into the Fives
Court, and knew they would have more when they got
<pb n="122"/>-
outside. They were an evil-looking lot, spongers all of
them.</p>

<p><said>You and the other gentleman had better keep your
eyes open. Thurtell's got a <soCalled>string of onions</soCalled> (low
fellows) who'll stick at nothing if he pays them. They'll
help him to get rid of his thousand pounds in less
than no time. You'd better have a body-guard,</said> said
Cribb.</p>

<p><said>Thanks, Tom. I don't think I want one. What
do you say, Walsham?</said></p>

<p><said>After what I've seen of you to-night, Ralstone, I
should say not,</said> said the young nobleman with a glance
of admiration and, possibly, envy.</p>

<p><said>As you like, sir. I only warn you. I saw one of
Thurtell's pals moving about the mob rather queerly.
You can have half a dozen of my friends. They'd be
pleased to do you a good turn for thrashing that bully.</said></p>

<p><said>I won't trouble them. I'm not going to keep them
from the good dinner that's waiting them.</said></p>

<p>So, shaking hands all round, Jack and his friend
passed into the narrow passage leading into St. Martin's
Street, and thence into Leicester Square.</p>

<p>The crowd was pouring out of the main entrance.
There seemed to be little to justify Spring's warning,
but Jack judged it prudent to cross to the other side of
the Square, where there were but few people. As things
fell out this was a mistake. The oil lamps, smoky
though they were, gave sufficient light to outline the
figures of the two Corinthians, so different in dress and
bearing from the rabble around, most of which had
drifted down from the adjacent <q>Seven Dials.</q></p>

<p>A hoarse shout came from somewhere. Jack could
distinguish the words: <said>There he is! That's the
nob!</said> A confused tramp of iron-shod and hobnailed
boots, and the mob surged towards them, the men
yelling, the women screaming.</p>

<p><said>Gad! Spring was right!</said> exclaimed Jack.
<said>You'll have to use your fists, Walsham. A stinger
or two'll take the fight out of them.</said></p>

<p>But he was wrong. By the time he had reached St.
Martin's Lane he was in the midst of a score or so of
<pb n="123"/>
burly ruffians, the scum of the <q>Dials,</q> infuriated by
drink, and attacking him in the hopes of getting more.
At the rear were fellows shouting as much, and egging
them on. The two foremost of his assailants Jack
floored with a couple of blows right and left, but others
took their place, and in the scrimmage he lost sight of
his companion.</p>

<p>Had Jack Ralstone been in an open space with the
country beyond, instead of in a street filled with a
seething, swaying mob, with nothing behind him but
a nest of vile courts and alleys—for Garrick Street did
not exist then, and between St. Martin's Lane and King
Street, Covent Garden, was a network of slums—he
could, by taking to his heels have easily escaped, for
he excelled as a sprinter. But as it was, his only course
was to fight, though against so many he hadn't a dog's
chance.</p>

<p>Setting his teeth Ralstone planted himself against
the wall of the nearest house and coolly fought on as
best he could. He was holding his own, never heeding
the blows that now and again reached him, and
oblivious of the blood that was streaming down his face
from a cut in the temple inflicted by a stone, when the
pressure of the mob shifted from the front of him to the
side. He was compelled perforce to move a pace or two
towards the Charing Cross end of St. Martin's Lane.
The pressure from the side increased. Again he had
to give way, and suddenly he found himself no longer
protected by the house, but opposite the mouth of a
narrow alley and forced into the arms of a vile set of
wretches streaming from the low gaming houses and
taverns of ill-repute, which abounded in this quarter.</p>

<p>Soon he was forced into this alley, buffeted this way
and that. He was like a cork in an eddy of froth.
Brutality was rampant. Those who had first attacked
him no doubt had a definite purpose in so doing, but
the rest were out for sport, and to hunt a helpless man
was as amusing to them as a dog-fight, a bull-baiting or
a <q>main</q> in a cockpit.</p>

<p>Amid the shower of blows that rained on him from
all sides he still retained consciousness. He fought
<pb n="124"/>
wildly, mechanically, and the strangest part of all was
that, after a time, he felt no pain. He had gone beyond
that stage. He might have been a prize-fighter in the
last round of a heavy slogging match. Further and
further he was drawn and pushed into the vortex of
vice and savagery. Then suddenly he had a dim
sense of emerging into a fairly wide street and the
clatter of horses' hoofs broke upon his ear. The sound
was the signal for the ruffians to disperse. They ran
in all directions like frightened rabbits. Mounted
soldiers galloped down the street, sweeping the human
dregs before them. The frightened watchmen, fearing
a riot and knowing they were unable to cope with it,
had sent post haste to the Horse Guards, and a squadron
had been ordered out.</p>

<p>But Jack Ralstone knew nothing of this, he was lying
insensible, his clothes nearly torn off his back, in front
of the door of a house in King Street.</p>

<p><said>Hadn't we better send for a doctor?</said></p>

<p><said>What for doctor? Massa's bones not broke.
Quamina feel dem. Droppy rum, Missy Barlowe.
Dat's de physic.</said></p>

<p><said>Rum—'tis all these blackamoors think of,</said> muttered
under her breath the matronly woman in the print
dress and apron standing by the couch, candlestick in
hand. <said>I suppose I'd better get it. If Quamina flies
into one of his passions—my goodness. But I'll see
that not a drop goes into his ugly black mouth if I
can help it.</said></p>

<p>She placed the candlestick on the table and bustled
away.</p>

<p>Quamina, a full-blooded negro, his skin like polished
ebony, bent over the prostrate form of Jack Ralstone,
and crooned some outlandish lingo—neither speech nor
song—in strange tones, half liquid, half guttural. It
<pb n="125"/>
was probably an incantation, peculiar to his race and
handed down from generation to generation. But he
had not neglected more mundane methods. He had
bathed and bound up Ralstone's cuts, he had gone over
the body and limbs to discover internal hurts, he had
massaged arms and legs; in fact, had he been attending
to a prize-fighter who had been <q>knocked out</q> he
would not have done differently.</p>

<p>Presently the woman returned, with a short-necked
stone bottle and a glass. The negro poured some of
the spirit within the white lips. They quivered, the
nerves of the arms twitched, the chest heaved slightly.</p>

<p><said>Massa fine feller—strong feller,</said> said he admiringly.</p>

<p><said>Aye, and a gentleman. Common people don't wear
fine linen, and if so be as his coat's torn, it's made of
real good broadcloth. <emph>I</emph> know good things when I see
'em.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone's senses were slowly returning, but he was
still in the world of nowhere. His rescuers had done
all they could and were watching his <choice><corr>unconscious</corr><orig>uncouscious</orig></choice>
struggle for the life which had so nearly slipped from
him.</p>

<p><said>It would ha' been a pity if so handsome a young
gentleman had been left to die on our doorstep. It was
a good thing, Quamina, as you went to see what the
rumpus was about and found him. 1 didn't know you
was so strong. You lifted him up by yourself and
brought him in. I was that frightened I dursn't go
out.</said></p>

<p>The negro, a tall, powerfully-built young fellow, the
great bossy muscles round his neck and shoulders,
which his open shirt disclosed, indicating enormous
strength, grunted in reply. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Barlowe's compli-
mentary remarks did not seem to affect him.</p>

<p>A silence fell upon the room. Ralstone slowly raised
his eyelids and dropped them again. His bewildered
glance had taken in his surroundings in a vague,
visionary way, and his muddled brain wove them into
the phantasma surging through his mind. The whole
thing was a grotesque dream, which vanished as
moments of oblivion occurred and reappeared when
<pb n="126"/>
the brain recommenced working. He was lying motion-
less. Nerves and muscles were quiescent. It was a
time of exhaustion, without pain, without any impulse
to exert will-power. Nature demanded rest and was
having her way. He was quite contented to remain
where he was undisturbed and allow the panorama of
realities and unrealities to unfold itself. Even the
sounds—the whispers of the man and woman—the slow
ticking of a grandfather's clock, a distant shout from
the street, fitted into their places in the chimera.</p>

<p>Then suddenly came sweet music. It was a woman's
voice, a voice which to his fevered imagination belonged
more to heaven than to <choice><corr>earth</corr><orig>eartth</orig></choice>. Ethereal though the
sounds were they did not seem incongruous. He was
puzzled, as the madness of dreams puzzles one. Gradu-
ally the harmonious intervals, making up the simplest
of melodies, overpowered everything else, and then he
became still more puzzled, for, if the singer was angelic,
the music was that of a mortal man. He knew the
air quite well. To hear it now transported him to a
crowded theatre—a vast arena—the plaudits of the
multitude. It was all real enough—the air, faint and
sickly with the perfumes from the boxes and dress
circle, mingled with the scent of oranges from the pit
and gallery. The melody dominated everything. The
play was poor enough, but the song and the singer saved
it.</p>

<p>In some strange way the recollection quickened the
return of vitality. Memory asserted itself and he
realised that he was listening to the air which has since
become world-famous and likely to last to touch the
hearts of countless generations yet to come—<q>Home,
sweet home.</q> Bishop's opera, <q>Clari, the Maid of
Milan,</q> had been produced a month or so before at
Covent Garden Theatre, and Maria Tree's delightful
singing of <q>Home, sweet home,</q> with the serenade,
<q>Sleep, gentle lady</q>—the only things in the opera
which have survived—had taken the town. Ralstone
had seen it twice, and he could have heard the divine
voice of the songstress over and over again and never
tire.</p>

<pb n="127"/>

<p>But <emph>this</emph> voice—the dream voice. It was no less
melodious than the material one, yet it was different.
Suddenly it ceased, and with its cessation the dream
vanished. The sharp tinkle of a bell, its brassy clang,
a violent contrast to the silvery tone of the voice, had
the effect of a tonic upon his nerves. For a brief space
he saw everything as it was—a plainly-furnished room,
with oil paintings on the walls, of the beer and treacle
school—brown and smudgy trees, yeasty waterfalls,
sooty skies, surrounded by heavy gold frames—the
negro and the woman at the door apparently having
an altercation. Then the woman bounced out of the
room and the man turned towards the couch on which
Ralstone was lying. The negro was scowling horribly
and a fiendish light gleamed in his eyes. But his for-
bidding expression vanished directly he saw that Ral-
stone was gazing at him intently.</p>

<p><said>How you feel, massa?</said> said he.</p>

<p><said>A bit shaken up. I don't know where I am. If
you brought me out of the rabble, I thank you.</said></p>

<p><said>Missy Barlowe say you no alive. Quamina say
yes. Quamina right.</said></p>

<p><said>Looks like it,</said> said Ralstone feebly. <said>Whose
house is this?</said></p>

<p><said>Missy Glover. She great stage player. She not at
home.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone was too weak to take much interest in
anything. He had heard of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover, of course—
he might have seen her play, but at that moment
nothing mattered. He closed his eyes and his brain
went simmering on in its own fashion. He did not
quite relapse into his former dreamy condition, but the
spasmodic clearness of vision and perception had passed.
He lay thus for a minute or so, during which came the
sounds of the opening of a door, of whispering voices,
but they failed to rouse him. When he again lifted his
eyelids it was not in consequence of any external in-
fluence, but purely an involuntary physical effort.</p>

<p>He saw standing about a yard from the couch a girl
whose eyes, dark as midnight, were fixed steadfastly
upon him. She was dressed in a way which gave her
<pb n="128"/>
distinction. The skirt was longer than what fashion
dictated. It swept the ground slightly and so added
to her stature, which in reality was slight. But that
which absorbed Ralstone's unbalanced mind was the
face and the hood which encircled it. It was of purple
silk, fringed with gold, and the effect was that of a
framed portrait such as Murillo might have painted.
The expression was passive, almost statuesque so far
as the lips were concerned, but tenderness and sympathy
shone in her eyes. The even, dusky pallor of her skin,
without the slightest tinge of sallowness, was exquisite.
It was the exact tint which her oval face demanded.</p>

<p><said>Poor fellow,</said> she murmured. <said>Are you sure,
Quamina, he's not seriously hurt?</said></p>

<p><said>Massa well. He no bad,</said> said the negro sullenly.
<said>Quamina make him better.</said></p>

<p>The man advanced towards the couch, evidently with
the intention of lifting Ralstone and carrying him out
of the house, when the girl interposed.</p>

<p><said>What are you going to do, Quamina? Are you
mad? Let him be. Tell me all about it, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Barlowe.
I had no idea anything was going on. I was in the
back room, you know, and with my singing I could
hear nothing.</said></p>

<p>The woman entered into a prolix description of how
Quamina went to the door out of curiosity and found
the man apparently dead, lying on the step. Of course,
she knew nothing of the cause of the disturbance, nor
how the man came to be lying where he was. The girl
put a number of questions, but <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Barlowe could say
no more. As for Quamina, when she turned to him,
he either could not or would not answer otherwise than
in a series of grunts, which might mean anything or
nothing. He stood with his aims folded, evidently in
an ill-humour.</p>

<p>The girl went up to Ralstone, whose eyes had never
ceased to follow her.</p>

<p><said>This isn't my house,</said> said she, <said>but I'm sure my
friend, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover, will let you stay here until you're
strong enough to walk by yourself.</said></p>

<p><said>I think I shall be able to do that soon, now that
<pb n="129"/>
I've seen you,</said> said he, speaking with difficulty and in
a low voice.</p>

<p>She smiled; and to Ralstone her smile was ravish-
ing. It set his heart beating, so much so that a faint
glow suffused his face, which before had been pale
enough.</p>

<p><said>That's rather a doubtful compliment. I'd no idea
that my presence would have the effect of making you
wish to go away. Perhaps I'd better leave you.</said></p>

<p><said>No—no. I implore you to stay. I've so much to
say to you, but—but for the moment I've so little
breath. It doesn't seem real—the sight of you, I
mean. I'm afraid to ask you the question that's worry-
ing me, lest it should prove I've made a terrible mis-
take.</said></p>

<p>The girl stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p><said>I don't understand you,</said> she cried. <said>What are
you talking about?</said></p>

<p><said>Haven't we once met?</said></p>

<p><said>No. I've never seen you before.</said></p>

<p><said>Are you in earnest? Look at me well. <emph>You</emph> are
the same—that is, your face—not, your dress.</said></p>

<p>She remained mute. Her eyes travelled over his
face, but her expression remained unmoved. The smile
had fled from her eyes. Maybe she thought the stranger
wanted to make her acquaintance.</p>

<p><said>I don't recognise you,</said> she said at length, coldly.</p>

<p><said>God, is it possible? I thought women never forgot.
If I've blundered, I humbly apologise.</said></p>

<p>She made no reply, but her eyes never left his face.</p>

<p><said>Of course, I'm altered. I forgot that,</said> he went on.
<said>You see, I've been knocked about a bit—out of
recognition, perhaps. If I hadn't the bandage over my
forehead, if my lips weren't cut and swollen—I don't
quite know what shape my nose is, it feels like a pound
weight—and I fancy one at least of my eyes is black.
But if I hadn't been twisted out of my proper self, the
sight of me might remind you of a certain ride to Bath.
You didn't wait for the port wine negus. I've never
forgotten <emph>that</emph>—not because of the negus, but because
you vanished. Now, am I wrong?</said></p>

<pb n="130"/>

<p>For an instant her face changed. Ralstone could not
decide what her expression meant. It certainly did not
indicate that she was pleased to see him again—that is,
if it were she.</p>

<p><said>You?</said> said she, with a little catch of the breath.
<said>Oh &#x2026;</said></p>

<p>Apparently she intended to say something more, but
she pulled herself up short and the beautiful mouth
hardened.</p>

<p><said>Yes. Ralstone's my name. That's the first thing
I've got to get right. The blockhead of an ostler at
the <q>Angel and Sun</q> told you it was Halstead. It
isn't. Old Halstead's my stepfather. He's no blood
relation. Does that make any difference to you?</said></p>

<p><said>All the difference in the world,</said> she breathed in so
low a voice that he hardly caught the words. But by
following the movement of her lips he was helped.</p>

<p>One other person in the room was as much interested
in what she said as was Jack Ralstone. This was
Quamina. The man had crept close to the girl, and was
listening intently.</p>

<p><said>Is that negro behind you your servant?</said> asked
Ralstone. <said>I've already thanked him for bringing me
in here and looking after me, but I don't think I need
his services any more.</said></p>

<p>The girl wheeled round sharply. Quamina, knowing
he was detected, was already stealing away.</p>

<p><said>You may go, Quamina,</said> said she. <said>If <add>I</add> want you
I'll ring.</said></p>

<p>The negro grinned, if showing his teeth like a wild cat
could be called a grin, and quitted the room noiselessly.</p>

<p><said>Quamina means no harm,</said> went on the girl. <said>He's
like a faithful dog—jealous of every one of whom I take
any particular notice. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Barlowe says he objected
to her telling me about you. You mustn't mind. Poor
Quamina, I owe everything to his  fidelity—and he has
suffered so much. He would die for me if need be,</said>
and she sighed deeply.</p>

<p>Ralstone could have said as much. Indeed, his im-
pending duel with Sir Phineas Tenbury might end in
that, for was not the challenge to fight forced upon him
<pb n="131"/>
on her behalf? But he could not tell her this.</p>

<p>In some marvellous way the sight of her revived his
drooping spirits and renewed his vigour. She had, in
his imagination, come to his rescue from another world.
He had never thought to see her again, and here, in his
hour of dire distress, she had miraculously appeared.
Ralstone's strain of romance dominated him at that
moment, and her apparition was to him not a coinci-
dence, but a miracle. Fate had ordained the meeting:
for what purpose who could say?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, lying there before her, apparently help-
less, was abhorrent to him, and he raised himself to a
sitting position and attempted to put on his tattered
coat. It was a futile struggle. Until then he had not
realised how bruised were his arm and shoulders, and
how strained were the muscles. But he was grateful to
his brutal assailants. But for them he would never
have seen her, but for them he would not have felt the
soft touch of her fingers when, bending down, she strove
to assist him.</p>

<p>In a flash that never-to-be-forgotten ride with her
clinging to him came back vividly to his mind. But
there was a difference. He had then his back turned
towards her. He was now looking into her eyes, lost
in their fathomless depths. A thrill went over him, and
she noticed it.</p>

<p><said>You're cold,</said> said she softly.</p>

<p><said>Cold?</said> and he laughed. <said>No, I'm not. And
yet in a way I suppose I am. I have to be, you know,</said>
and involuntarily he glanced at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Barlowe, who was
looking a little puzzled at the absorption of the two.
The expression of her face denoted that she was a little
scandalised at the interest the girl was showing in a
complete stranger. It made it worse that the stranger
was young, handsome, and apparently a gentleman.</p>

<p>Ralstone wondered if she understood him. Anyhow,
if he was cold, she was icy. He might as well have been
silent for anything that her face told him. She simply
went on coaxing his arm into his coat-sleeve. Not
another word passed. Jack Ralstone could not trust
<pb n="132"/>
himself to speak. How could he, with her soft, round
arms, bare to the elbow, hovering about him?</p>

<p>When the coat was finally adjusted he essayed to rise
to his feet. She protested.</p>

<p><said>You mustn't go yet. You're not sufficiently
recovered.</said></p>

<p><said>Thank you. I could stop here for ever if I might,
but——</said></p>

<p>His voice sank. A sudden giddiness had seized him.
He had overrated his strength, and his face had gone
deadly white.</p>

<p><said><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Barlowe,</said> said she, rapidly wheeling round.
<said>Fetch my cordial water and vinaigrette, please.
They're on my toilet-table.</said></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Barlowe hesitated. It did not seem quite
proper to leave the two young people alone.</p>

<p><said>Shall I send Quamina here to help you?</said> said she
stiffly.</p>

<p><said>No, no. What do I want with Quamina? Do what
I tell you. Quick. See, he's going to swoon, I believe.</said></p>

<p>The girl spoke in quite an angry tone. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Barlowe
said no more, but fled.</p>

</div>


<div n="13" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="13">XIII</num></head>
<head type="main">A Startling Letter</head>

<p>Ralstone did not lose his senses. The faintness was
passing now that he had ceased to exert himself. Every
word the girl uttered was distinctly audible, and her
solicitude filled him with secret joy. A few silent
moments after the door closed, and looking up into her
face he murmured:</p>

<p><said>Why did you run away? You remember, don't
you? When I returned and found you gone I didn't
know what to make of it. I felt a little hurt.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I'm sorry,</said> she returned hurriedly, and her
bosom heaved. <said>You must have thought me very
ungrateful. But I wasn't. I wanted to thank you,
but directly I heard your name was Halstead something
<pb n="133"/>
dragged me away. I couldn't be under an obligation
to anyone of that name and in whose veins ran the
blood of that—that beast.</said></p>

<p><said>You mean Simon Halstead?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes. Some day, perhaps, you may know why.
But I can't tell you now. It's everything to me that
you've nothing to do with him. It may alter my plans
—I don't know—I'm confused—I——</said></p>

<p>She became terribly agitated. Footsteps were heard
on the staircase outside. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Barlowe was returning.
When she entered the girl had regained her calmness,
and, taking the quaintly-shaped bottle from the woman,
she poured out a little of the contents into a glass, and
Ralstone sipped the fragrant amber liquid.</p>

<p><said>It's very good. I never tasted anything so fine.
It's put new life into me. What rare stuff for a cold
hunting morning after an hour's run. I'd like to buy
a bottle. Where can I get some?</said></p>

<p><said>Not in London—not in England anywhere. It
comes from the West India plantations.</said></p>

<p><said>The plantations——</said></p>

<p>Her finger went to her lips in token of secrecy, and he
said no more. The word <q>plantations</q> had started a
current of puzzling thoughts, but nothing could be
discussed with the tiresome Barlowe hovering about,
and Jack whispered a request to be allowed to meet her,
where they could talk freely.</p>

<p><said>I'm staying at the <q>Tavistock.</q> I shan't rest—I
can't—until I see you again. I've a thousand questions
to ask—your name, for instance. You know mine.
It's only fair,</said> he expostulated.</p>

<p><said>I'm known in this house as Amelia Hart. I'm a
sort of maid-companion to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover, the actress—
the kindest-hearted soul in the world. But for her I
must have died. She knows something about me—I
had to tell her, you know—but not everything. There's
a man who's my bitter enemy. I dare not go out in the
day-time for fear—ah, there she is. I know her knock.</said></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Barlowe hurried away. Once more they were
together. Jack seized the girl's hand.</p>

<pb n="134"/>

<p><said>Tell me—I insist upon it—how can we meet?</said> he
exclaimed.</p>

<p><said>I don't know—I can't think; stay—I'll find some
way of letting you know. At the <q>Tavistock,</q> you say.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, but don't send any message by that black
fellow of yours. I don't think he likes me. He might
play you false.</said></p>

<p><said>Quamina play me false? <emph>Me?</emph> Oh, you don't
know him.</said></p>

<p><said>That's true, and I can't say I'm particularly anxious
to make his acquaintance. You see——</said></p>

<p><said>Hush. Here is <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover.</said></p>

<p>The clever actress came bustling in. She was then
at the height of her popularity, and her fine, deep, rich
voice, her commanding presence, and her energy, made
her unrivalled in certain parts. When, the year before.
she played the part of Hamlet at Drury Lane. she
achieved a <foreign xml:lang="fr">tour de force</foreign> that was the talk of the town.
Nature in a generous mood had moulded her lavishly.
She was tall and stout in her middle age—too stout
possibly as she grew older—not perhaps handsome, but
her face was expressive and open, with fine eyes that
stared fixedly at one and invited confidence.</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Barlowe had told her of the incident, and the
actress was full of sympathy.</p>

<p><said>The vile wretches,</said> she exclaimed. <said>I suppose
their idea was robbery.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't know, madam, but if so they carried it out
with great nicety. I haven't a penny left.</said></p>

<p><said>You poor young gentleman! How much do you
think you've lost?</said></p>

<p>Jack dreaded to think. His intention was, after he
left the Fives Court, to go on to White's Club with Lord
Walsham and try his luck at the faro table. He had
scraped together all the money he had, and the thieves
had made a decent haul. He returned some indefinite
answer to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover, and, good-natured as she was to
a degree, she immediately offered to lend him a small
sum. He thanked her, but refused, and, remarking that
he had reached the limits of her hospitality, he rose to
go.</p>

<pb n="135"/>

<p><said>Are you sure you can walk without assistance?
Shall Quamina go with you?</said></p>

<p><said>Not on any account. It's no distance to the
<q>Tavistock,</q> and I can look after myself quite well,
thanks to the magic virtues of some mysterious cordial
Miss Hart has been good enough to administer.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, Amelia is a rare hand at mysterious concoctions.
I believe she knows all about poisons.</said></p>

<p>A spasm seemed to pass over the girl's face at this
jesting accusation, but she made no reply. She was
evidently much disturbed, and Jack was prompted to
come to her rescue by a playful allusion to his ragged
attire.</p>

<p><said>I don't know what the hotel people will think of
me. Perhaps they'll fancy I'm the beggar of Bethnal
Green come to life.</said></p>

<p><said>Dress is nothing,</said> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover laughingly.
<said>Amelia can tell you something about that.</said></p>

<p><said>Indeed,</said> remarked Ralstone, with a well-assumed
air of innocence. <said>I should much like to hear the
story.</said></p>

<p><said>It's nothing, and it wouldn't interest a stranger,</said>
said Amelia.</p>

<p>Ralstone bowed, and as he did so he contrived to cast
a glance which spoke volumes.</p>

<p><said>I'm not so sure about that,</said> put in the actress,
<said>but I won't tease you any more to-night. It wouldn't
be right after you've played the part of the Good
Samaritan so well.</said> Then, turning to Ralstone, she
went on to suggest that, to save <choice><corr>appearances</corr><orig>appearences</orig></choice>, she could
let him have one of her husband's coats.</p>

<p><said>He's not living here,</said> said she, a shade of sadness
passing over her face, <said>so he won't miss it.</said></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover was unfortunate both in her father and
husband. The first sponged upon her, the second was
a drunkard.</p>

<p><said>I'm sure I won't trouble you. The <q>Tavistock</q>
people know what a London mob is like. It's not the
first time one of their customers has come home like a
rag-bag. Thank you again, and goodnight.</said></p>

<p>His leave-taking was formal. It could hardly be
<pb n="136"/>
otherwise. With Amelia Hart, as she chose to be called,
he did not dare go further than tenderly press her <sic>band</sic>.
Was it his fancy, or did she really return that pressure?
Whether it was the effect of the cordial, or the fillip to
his nerves at the unexpected sight of the beautiful girl,
the subject of his constantly-recurring waking dreams,
and the mysterious cause of the bitter enmity of Sir
Phineas towards him, Ralstone could not determine,
but he forgot his stiffness and his aches and pains, and
walked quite briskly to the hotel.</p>

<p>The clock of St. Paul's, Covent Garden, struck twelve
as he entered the portals of the <q>Tavistock,</q> but the hour
was not late for those free-and-easy times. The coffee-
room windows were lighted up, and the porter, while
staring at Ralstone's bandaged hand, betrayed no
<choice><corr>surprise</corr><orig>suprise</orig></choice>. <q>The Tavistock,</q> as a <q>bachelors' house,</q>
was used to the young bloods, its patrons, not
infrequently coming back in rather a dilapidated condi-
tion. Indeed, Gregory the porter was a rare hand at
<q>painting</q> and disguising black eyes.</p>

<p><said>Glad to see you back, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone. Had a rough
time, I hear, sir.</said></p>

<p><said>What, has the news reached you already?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, sir, in course we heard the shindy, and some
of our gentlemen went out to see the fun, but we didn't
know as you was in it.</said></p>

<p><said>I was <emph>it</emph>, Gregory, worse luck.</said></p>

<p><said>So I heered, sir.</said></p>

<p><said>The deuce you did. How?</said></p>

<p><said>Lord Walsham called to inquire about you, sir.
He'd been round to the watch-house, but they knowed
nothing.</said></p>

<p><said>Was his lordship hurt at all?</said></p>

<p><said>Not much, sir. The blackguards seem to have let
him alone. They made a dead set on you, sir, he says.</said></p>

<p><said>That was so. I was pretty well done for, but
luckily I fell into good hands, and I've been patched up.</said></p>

<p>He was within an ace of saying that it was at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Glover's house in King Street where he was sheltered,
but he remembered the girl's caution in time and he said
nothing.</p>

<pb n="137"/>

<p><said>Glad to hear it, sir. Are you, going in the coffee-
room? A niceish company there, sir.</said></p>

<p><said>What, in this ragged, out-at-elbows state? Not
likely. I'm going to bed. Send up some mulled claret
to my room.</said></p>

<p><said>Very well, sir. Good night, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone.—Oh,
blest if I didn't nigh forget. Here's something for you,
sir.</said></p>

<p>The porter took a letter from the rack on the mantel-
shelf and handed it to Ralstone. The writing was un-
mistakably feminine, all pothooks and hangers, in the
sloping Italian style taught then in fashionable boarding-
schools.</p>

<p><said>H'm,</said> grunted Jack with a grimace, when he looked
at it. He did not open the letter. He thought it would
keep until he reached his bedroom. He imagined it to
be from one of the fair Cyprians whom in the Covent
Garden saloon an evening or two before he had treated
to a bottle of wine.</p>

<p><said>I didn't think I'd been such a noodle as to tell that
brown-haired wench where I was staying. I suppose I
did. Fool!</said></p>

<p>He toiled up the stairs, lighted candle in his hand,
and when he got into his room he threw himself into an
easy chair. He was dead beat, and no wonder. The
reaction had set in, his bruises and cuts pained him,
and he was stiff all over. He caught sight of his reflec-
tion in the toilet glass and burst into a laugh which
hadn't an atom of mirth in it.</p>

<p><said>The devil! What a Guy Fawkes I look! I
wonder what the dear girl thought of me. Never mind,
when next she sees me I shall be myself. When <emph>next</emph>—
when? What a mystery the thing is! She began by
being a mystery, and she's continuing to be one. What
will the end be like—but, after all, what's a woman
worth when there's nothing to find out about her?</said></p>

<p>Presently a knock came at the door. A waiter had
brought up the mulled claret. The warm drink was
comforting, and, snuggling in his chair, Jack sipped it
slowly and thought over things—that is to say, he
thought of the midnight eyes, the fascinating pallor,
<pb n="138"/>
the raven hair, the delightful chin, the scarlet lips,
and a hundred other charms of the girl who had taken
possession of him.</p>

<p><said><q>My name in this house is Amelia Hart,</q> she said.
What is it outside the house? I don't like Amelia
Hart. It's commonplace. She's had to take it for
some reason. That means she's afraid to use her own
name. And she dares not got out in the day. Why?
Is <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover in the know? What's that nigger—
Quadrumana—Quadrillana—can't think of it—got to
do with her? And, above all, that fellow Tenbury—
what part does he play in the business?</said></p>

<p>The recollection of Sir Phineas stirred the young
man's bile. Sir Phineas had already served him one
dishonourable trick—of making love to Lady Barbara
Dacre, who he must have known was betrothed. That
neither he nor Lady Barbara cared for each other did
not excuse Tenbury's conduct. Of course, Lady Bar-
bara was to blame too, but that did not matter. It was
a woman's privilege to change her mind.</p>

<p><said>Tenbury can have her ladyship and welcome,</said> cried
Jack, addressing his reflection in the mirror, <said>but I'm
damned if he shall interfere with my dark-eyed damsel.
She's mine and I'm proving it by fighting for her.</said></p>

<p>He felt suddenly exalted. How wonderful it was
that a mere slip of a girl should have the power of
dominating him, of forcing him to concentrate every
thought, every feeling, every emotion upon her! If
this meant love, then he was most assuredly in love, in
all senses of the word.</p>

<p>Jack Ralstone had had his flirtations—what young
man in those Fourth Georgian days had not? Flirting
was part of his education, like tying a cravat properly,
or going the grand tour, but all his flirtations had left
him heart-whole. But this—oh, this was no flirtation.
It was life—real life and real love.</p>

<p>He thought of the painted, brazen women he had
talked with and treated at the Drury Lane and Covent
Garden saloons—at Vauxhall Gardens—at some of the
gaming hells, where they played the part of decoys.
What a difference between this horde of Jezebels and
<pb n="139"/>
the girl who, even in her tatters, looked pure and
innocent!</p>

<p><said>Yes,</said> he soliloquised, <said>and she's not a Barbara
Dacre either. I'll swear that if once she loved she
would be constant, she would never go from her word.
But—Barbara——</said></p>

<p>Finishing the sentence with a shrug of the shoulders,
Ralstone commenced to undress, taking off his coat with
difficulty—a difficulty which brought to his remem-
brance the girl's tender deftness when she assisted him
to put it on.</p>

<p>As he sat with the coat across his <choice><corr>knees</corr><orig>kness</orig></choice>, it occurred
to him to see whether the thieves had left him any
money. He went through his pockets. He found no
money, but he pulled out the letter given him by
Gregory.</p>

<p>He frowned. It was unpleasant to be reminded of
his folly. Only one motive could actuate a writer of
the class to which he believed she belonged—money.</p>

<p><said>I think I can open the thing with perfect safety,</said>
he thought, smiling bitterly, <said><choice><corr>seeing</corr><orig>seing</orig></choice> that I've been
cleaned out of every penny. So much the better. I
shan't have the trouble of making up my mind.</said></p>

<p>He tore through the wax and unfolded the paper.
What he read was this, and it took his breath away:</p>

<p><q>My Dearest Jack,</q></p>

<p><q>I am writing humbly to ask your forgiveness.
Believe me, I've been utterly miserable ever since you
left me that night at Bath. I know I behaved badly
to you. I ought not to have said what I did. I can't
think what possessed me. You'll forget it, won't you?
Do let us make it up. Come and see me to-morrow.
I feel I shall die if you keep away any longer. You
don't know how much I love you. Fondly,</q></p>

<p><q>Yours,</q></p>

<p><q>Barbara.</q></p>

<div n="14" type="chapter">
<pb n="140"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="14">XIV</num></head>
<head type="main">What the Spy Reported</head>

<p>Sir Phineas Tenbury, with the assistance of his valet,
had not long got out of bed. It was about midday, and
he was toying with devilled kidneys and frizzled bacon,
and sipping coffee laced with cognac. He was arrayed
in a gorgeous dressing-gown, and on his head was an
embroidered smoking-cap adorned with a huge tassel.
The whole effect, to the taste of the twentieth century,
was somewhat raffish, not a little of the raffishness
being due possibly to the generally wrecked condition
of the baronet. Sir Phineas had had a heavy night;
his eyes were bleared, his cheeks were puffy, his mouth
loose, and his complexion whitish, with here and there
a yellow patch. He had been, until the small hours
were well on their way, in one of the questionable
gaming houses of St. James's Street, Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Tenbury had chambers in the <q>Albany.</q> The room
in which he was sitting, or rather sprawling, his legs
crossed, one slippered foot dangling over the edge of the
sofa, and the other extended along its length, was
furnished and adorned after the fashion in favour with
men of <foreign xml:lang="fr">ton</foreign>. Coloured prints of hunting and coaching
scenes, coloured pictures of ballet girls, of boxing
celebrities, of distinguished race horses, ratters, and
champion game cocks covered the walls, interspersed
with coarse, coloured caricatures which lampooned men
and women of the day in a style both abusive and
libellous.</p>

<p>It was a lovely summer's day, but all the sun which
came into the room was that reflected from a wall
opposite the window. The <q>Albany,</q> with all its
attractions for men about town, was not a cheerful
place of residence—at all events in the daytime. At
night things were different. Life then began with
those whose idea of existence was to plunge into excess
of so-called pleasure, when the rest of the world were
in their beds. Perfect freedom was aimed at in the
<pb n="141"/>
<q>Albany,</q> and it could be had by those who chose to
be liberal to the attendants. It was in fact an Alsatia
for aristocrats.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas lazily ran his eye over the <title>Morning Post</title>
and tossed it aside impatiently. <title>Bell's Life</title> and <title>John
Bull</title> were not more interesting; he let them slip on the
floor and did not bother to pick them up. He yawned,
stretched out his arm with an effort, reached the hand
bell and shook it. His valet entered and waited for
orders.</p>

<p><said>Clear away this muck, Benham,</said> said the baronet
querulously. <said>Pass me the cognac and the carafe.
Pah! My throat's as dry as the road to Epsom on a
dusty day.</said></p>

<p>The man administered to his master's wants and
noiselessly and expeditiously removed the evidence of
breakfast, while Sir Phineas slaked his thirst. Then,
with his hands behind his head he leaned back and
pondered. He was wondering if Lady Barbara Dacre
had kept her word and carried out the programme he
had laid down.</p>

<p>Two days had gone by since the fateful night at
Almack's and meanwhile he had satisfied the blackmail-
ing <choice><corr>propensities</corr><orig>propensites</orig></choice> of the rapacious <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews, not
indeed to the full extent of her demands, but sufficiently
to keep her quiet for a few weeks. He had not the
slightest intention of allowing the women to spoil his
plans in regard to Ralstone. It was vital that they
should succeed, for at that moment Ralstone was
causing him much perturbation of mind.</p>

<p><said>Barbara seems likely to stick to me like a leech,</said>
he mused. <said>Damme, I never thought she'd take
matters so seriously. How stupid to mix up sentiment
with a <foreign xml:lang="fr">faux pas</foreign>. The second can be excused but not
the first. That's the worst of women. One never knows
what their views are in such matters. Who would have
thought the Duke would have cut up so rough. The
old rip's closing of his pockets over her debts was an
unexpected blow for me, still if Ralstone can be bamboo-
zled into taking the girl off my hands everything will
<pb n="142"/>
go smoothly. Anyhow I convinced Barbara and if she's
any sense she'll do what I told her.</said></p>

<p>He closed his eyes. His expression altered. Other
thoughts had taken hold of his mind. His mouth
hardened and his nostrils twitched and whitened—a
sure sign with him of suppressed passion.</p>

<p><said>Why the devil hasn't Vicary turned up? Three
weeks gone and not a sign of the fellow,</said> he burst out.
<said>It's true I told him not to bother me unless he had
matters to report, but it's impossible he shouldn't
have been able to find out something by this time.
Perhaps——</said></p>

<p>A tap came at the door. It was Benham.</p>

<p><said>Vicary has come, Sir Phineas. He told me——</said></p>

<p><said>Devil take what he told you. Send him up at once.
Talk of the devil and you smell sulphur.</said></p>

<p>Vicary entered, the obsequious bend of his shoulders
more pronounced than ever. He was the manservant
whose mingled insolence and feigned humility so excited
Jack Ralstone's ire at the <q>George,</q> Andover, on the
morning of the prize fight. Before being engaged by
Sir Phineas, Vicary had filled the despicable rôle of a
<q>common informer,</q> and it was whispered that three
years before he had been in the pay of the infamous
Edwards, whose perjury secured the conviction and
execution of Thistlewood and his fellow conspirators.
Anyway, after the brutal exhibition on the scaffold
there followed a reaction in public opinion and Vicary
hastened to earn his living in another way. As a spy
Sir Phineas had found him exceedingly useful in many
intrigues.</p>

<p><said>Well, Vicary, what news?</said> inquired Sir Phineas
eagerly.</p>

<p><said>Nothing of very great importance, sir. I'm sorry to
say—that is, I haven't <choice><corr>succeeded</corr><orig>succeded</orig></choice> in getting upon the
track of the girl.</said></p>

<p><said>Then what the deuce do you mean by bothering
me?</said> stormed Sir Phineas. <said>You know what I told
you.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, Sir Phineas. But I have something to say,
<pb n="143"/>
that I thought would interest you, about the young
gentleman.</said></p>

<p><said>Damn the young gentleman, but go on. You'd
better have a drink. It might ease your tongue. Help
yourself.</said></p>

<p><said>Thank you, sir.</said></p>

<p>Vicary did not hurry. It was his habit to be
deliberate. Sir Phineas, turning on his side, watched
him frowningly.</p>

<p><said>I've every reason to believe, sir, that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone,
if not dead, is next door to it.</said></p>

<p><said>What!</said></p>

<p>Ralstone's death was a possibility which had not
entered into Sir Phineas's calculations. He had never
bothered about it, not even in connection with the duel.
It might have the effect of altering many of his plans.
But he was not one to waste time upon mere conjectures.
He harshly bade the spy explain himself.</p>

<p><said>It was this way, sir. Ever since you put me on
this job I've never lost sight of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone—that is,
sir, whenever he showed himself in the street. I hadn't
to bother about him in the hotel, because, as you know,
sir, no lady would be admitted into the <q>Tavistock.</q>
I've followed him into the theatres—Covent Garden,
Drury Lane, the Surrey, Davis's amphitheatre in the
Westminster Bridge Road—it used to be called Astley's,
sir—<q>Tom and Jerry's</q> been having quite a run
there——</said></p>

<p><said>Really,</said> broke in Sir Phineas ironically, <said>seems to
me, Vicary, you've been enjoying yourself. It doesn't
interest me where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone went, seeing that it has
all led to nothing.</said></p>

<p><said>I was going to explain, sir,</said> said Vicary apologeti-
cally, <said>that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone never had a lady with him on
these occasions. Nor did he ever meet a lady, that is
to say, <emph>your</emph> lady.</said></p>

<p><said>What about Vauxhall Gardens? Did he ever go
there?</said> demanded the baronet, with a slight nervous-
ness in his manner which sat strangely upon him.</p>

<p><said>Oh yes, sir, often and often. And once he was with
<pb n="144"/>
a party of ladies and gentlemen in one of the supper
boxes.</said></p>

<p><said>Well. And the ladies? Did you see them?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, sir. I think you'll find them nearly every
night in the Drury Lane saloon. I didn't bother about
them. No, sir, nothing suspicious happened at
Vauxhall.</said></p>

<p><said>Of course not,</said> said Sir Phineas, with a forced laugh.
<said>I was a fool to suppose that she would be at the
Gardens.</said></p>

<p><said>Quite so, sir. Too many unpleasant reflections.
Her painful experience would be too fresh in her mind.</said></p>

<p><said>Painful? What the devil do you mean by pain-
ful?</said> cried Sir Phineas irritably.</p>

<p><said>I beg your pardon, Sir Phineas. Of course not.
She was foolish. She was unnecessarily alarmed. You
wouldn't have harmed her.</said></p>

<p><said>Keep your opinions about my conduct to yourself.
They don't interest me. What of Ralstone? If he
was as long in dying as you are in getting through
your story, I pity the poor devil.</said></p>

<p><said>I crave forgiveness, sir. I was only anxious to
show you that I had faithfully done my duty and had
neglected nothing. But about <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone. Last
night I followed him to the Fives Court. It was Tom
Cribb's benefit and there was no end of sparring. A
man named Thurtell—maybe your honour has heard of
him—was there. He was the worse for liquor, and
from what I overheard he'd come on purpose to revenge
himself on <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone over some grievance. He
challenged <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone to a boxing match and got
badly beaten. The word was passed among his friends
to wait on <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone when he left the Court, and
they <emph>did</emph> wait on him. It was as savage a bit of
business as ever I see.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh!</said> ejaculated Sir Phineas, his eyes gleaming.
<said>He was knocked about, was he?</said></p>

<p><said>Knocked—kicked—stoned. It's my belief Thurtell
had given orders that he was to be beaten to death.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes—yes. And was he?</said></p>

<p><said>I'm not sure, sir. The mob drove him into Rose
<pb n="145"/>
Street and I followed, but when I got into King Street
I heard the horse soldiers coming, and I ran out of the
way as quickly as I could.</said></p>

<p><said>I'll warrant you did. Trust you for keeping your
skin whole, Vicary,</said> said Sir Phineas sardonically.
<said>And what became of young Ralstone?</said></p>

<p><said>That's what I couldn't find out. When the coast
was clear I went down King Street and made inquiries,
but could learn nothing. It was the same at the watch
house.</said></p>

<p><said>And what about the <q>Tavistock</q>?</said></p>

<p><said>I didn't go there, sir.</said></p>

<p><said>You fool. That's the very place you should have
called at.</said></p>

<p><said>I know that, sir, but to tell you the truth, Gregory,
the porter there, and me are not over good friends. He
got into trouble some long time ago, and I had to appear
against him in the witness box at Bow Street Court.
He was put away at Clerkenwell prison and he's never
forgiven me.</said></p>

<p><said>And I don't suppose he ever will. I understand.
So you think <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone is dead?</said></p>

<p><said>I don't say he's lying dead at this moment, but be
was so fiercely set upon he can hardly recover.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, you'd better find out and give me the latest
news of him. Send some one to the <q>Tavistock</q> the
porter hasn't a grudge against. I suppose you've
acquaintances who've not belonged to your former
admirable profession.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, yes, sir.</said></p>

<p><said>Very well, see to it then.</said></p>

<p>Vicary touched his forehead and lingered hesitatingly.
Sir Phineas guessed why. He threw a couple of guineas
on the table and the spy departed.</p>

<p>For some time after he was alone Sir Phineas sat with
his brow puckered and his lips moving in accordance
with his thoughts, but he uttered no sound.</p>

<p>The sum of his cogitations was that if Vicary spoke
the truth it did not appear as though Ralstone knew
the whereabouts of the girl with whom he had un-
doubtedly ridden away. He had taken her to the
<pb n="146"/>
<q>Angel and Sun</q> just outside Bath—so much Sir
Phineas had ascertained from the ostler—and here all
trace of her was lost.</p>

<p><said aloud="false">I can't believe Ralstone would be the man to let her
slip out of his reach,</said> thought the baronet. <said aloud="false">The
little cat's far too fascinating. She's as full of wiles as
a monkey, and if she chose could worm her way into
any man's heart. The worst of it is she's not to be
tempted by either gold or gems. I tried her with both.
A woman of that sort generally makes a fool of herself.
Falls in love with some handsome boy, whose attraction
seems to be that he knows nothing of women and that
she'll have the pleasure of teaching him. If he didn't
fall in love with her and so was inclined to give Lady
Barbara the go-by when she vexed him, he's got those
damned woman-loving eyes for no purpose. And
Nyra? Black as a gipsy—I'll swear she's got some
nigger blood in her—and he a fair Saxon. Opposites
attract each other. Where do I come in? Curse them
both.</said></p>

<p>He had been comforting himself during this mental
tirade with neat cognac, and had worked himself into a
fury. Then he realised the folly of his outburst, sup-
posing Ralstone was on the point of death. What
would be his position then? Surely all to the good.
His debt of £4,000 need not be discharged, and he
would be perfectly free to run to earth the girl who had
escaped him. Lady Barbara would, of course, be done
out of her prospect of a reconciliation which would have
given her a rich husband, for no doubt Simon Halstead
would keep his word if Ralstone made it up with her.
But Lady Barbara's future was no concern of the
baronet's. He had made use of her purely to spite
Ralstone, and the elimination of the latter sent her out
of his reckoning also.</p>

<p>But the point to be settled was the condition of
Ralstone—whether he was likely to recover.</p>

<p><said>I must know at once,</said> was his conclusion. <said>That
rascal Vicary is as likely as not to spin out the job to
run up the cost. I'll see about it myself.</said></p>

<p>He made his usual careful toilet with the aid of
<pb n="147"/>
Benham, and in about two hours' time strolled down
St. James's Street and looked in at White's. The news
of the affair at the Fives Court on the preceding night
was all the talk. Many members of the club were
interested in the <soCalled>fancy</soCalled> and some had been present
as Tom Cribb's patrons. They were all enthusiastic
over the skill and pluck of Jack Ralstone, but no one
could say exactly what had become of him, save that he
was lying at the <q>Tavistock.</q></p>

<p><said>Walsham was with him,</said> said a Waterloo man
and an old comrade of Tenbury's, Captain Frederick
Charteris by name. <said>And I believe he came out of
the scrimmage without a scratch, but from what I hear
the two became separated early in the row and he's as
much in the dark as anybody, or was—for I should
think by this time he had called at the <q>Tavistock</q> to
inquire after his friend.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas made no comment. He did not particu-
larly want to appear to be interested in Ralstone.
Besides, the mention of Lord Walsham had started
a train of thought. Shortly after he buttonholed
Charteris.</p>

<p><said>Fred,</said> said he, <said>I want your advice on a little
affair of honour. I received a challenge a short time
ago from a man—I'm not going to mention his name
just yet—Walsham was going to act for him and
Houston for me. Houston, as you know, has gone off
to Paris with little Marie Dupont of the <q>King's</q> and
how long he'll stay there the deuce only can tell. Now
the point is, should I wait until Walsham asks for some
one to take Houston's place, or should I suggest another
man?</said></p>

<p><said>How long is it since Walsham went to see
Houston?</said> rejoined the Captain with a twirl of his
whiskers and with a solemnity of manner which he
invariably assumed when his services were required in
connection with a duel.</p>

<p><said>Quite a fortnight.</said></p>

<p><said>And <emph>you</emph> haven't heard from him?</said></p>

<p><said>No.</said></p>

<pb n="148"/>

<p><said>That doesn't look as if his principal were very eager.
Has he never been out before?</said></p>

<p><said>I'm sure I can't say. I should fancy not.</said></p>

<p><said>H'm, then I don't wonder he's hesitating. Your
record in the field is likely to make him think twice.
But you can't have a challenge hanging over your head
indefinitely. I should ascertain if he means to go on,
Tenbury.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas did not at once reply. He was pondering
on the matter.</p>

<p><said>Yes,</said> said he at last, <said>that seems the proper course.
Will you act for me?</said></p>

<p><said>With great pleasure. Not the first time, you know,
Tenbury. Shall I write to Walsham conveying your
wishes?</said></p>

<p><said>Not for the moment. I want to turn the thing
round in my mind; I'll let you know as soon as I've
come to a decision. I merely wanted to be sure of you
in case of need.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, that's <foreign xml:lang="fr">un fait accompli.</foreign></said></p>

<p><said>Thanks.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas sauntered out with a somewhat pre-
occupied air. A notion had entered his head—not a
chivalrous one by any means, but whether he would act
upon it depended upon what he ascertained from the
people of the <q>Tavistock,</q> whither he was now bent.</p>

<p>Gregory touched his cap respectfully to the baronet.
He knew Sir Phineas very well and was about to precede
him to the coffee-room to open the door, but Tenbury
checked him.</p>

<p><said>I'm not going to stay. I merely called to inquire
how <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone was. I've had rather bad accounts
of him.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, sir, I do think anybody but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jack Rals-
tone would be a-lying on his back with half a dozen
doctors a-consulting over him as to how long he ought
to be allowed to live. But <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone ain't a gentle-
man o' that sort. He slept like a top for ten or eleven
hours and we didn't trouble to waken him—he was
breathin' as easily as a child—knowing as rest was the
best physic. About twelve he got up, had a bath, sent
<pb n="149"/>
for a surgeon to take the bandage off his head and put
on a bit o' strapping, and made a hearty breakfast,
rumpsteak and mushrooms, sir. It would ha' done your
honour's heart good to see him put it away. I under-
stand he was brought up in the country—runnin',
jumpin', cricket, shootin', fishin', fox huntin'—ah, there's
nothin' like the good old English sport for givin' a
man muscles an' for layin' down a stock of 'ealth.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas frowned. The news of Ralstone's speedy
recovery did not seem to please him.</p>

<p><said>And where is he now? In his room?</said></p>

<p><said>Lor bless me, no, sir. Out and about as brisk as a
bee. He's not like them P.R. men as takes to their
drink d'rectly they comes to theirselves. All they
think of is 'ow much liquor they can swaller.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm glad to hear that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone's better,</said> said
Sir Phineas in a tone the irony of which was quite lost
on Gregory.</p>

<p><said>Thank'ee, sir. I'll tell him you called.</said></p>

<p>It was on the tip of the baronet's tongue to say,
<q>Don't do anything of the kind,</q> but on second thoughts
he held his tongue. Outwardly he had to behave as a
gentleman. It was part of his reputation. It was
said that when he pinked his antagonist or sent a bullet
through the arm, or any part of the body that fancy
might select, he did it in the most gentlemanly way
<choice><corr>possible</corr><orig>passible</orig></choice>. After a duel he was invariably solicitous
that the wounded man should be carefully tended.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas quitted the hotel very much perturbed.
The vague notion which had passed through his mind
at White's was that if the duel were to come off there
could be no better time for it than while Ralstone was
enfeebled. But this idea would have to be discarded.
In less than a week Ralstone in all probability would be
in possession of his full health and strength.</p>

<p>Exactly as he yearned to revenge himself upon his
rival by the latter's death at his hand, a more bitter
and more complete plan was that in which he designed
Lady Barbara should play a part. That Lady Barbara
when married to Ralstone should still be mistress of
another man was a device worthy of Iago. But this
<pb n="150"/>
depended upon the issue of her ladyship's blandishments.
Would she succeed in winning back her truant love?
Sir Phineas felt that his hand was stayed until this
matter was settled.</p>

<p>Then there was the incomparable dark-eyed girl upon
whose conquest Sir Phineas had set his heart. What
part was she destined to play in the drama notwith-
standing the fact that for the present she had dropped
out? Sir Phineas was convinced she would reappear
though he had nothing to justify this conviction. Any-
how, the marriage of Ralstone and Lady Barbara would
serve a double purpose. It would make any attachment
between Ralstone and the girl impossible.</p>

<p>But if there had already been some love passages
between the two? Because Vicary had failed to find
any evidence that Ralstone knew where she was hardly
seemed conclusive proof. The possibility that Vicary
had blundered or had been negligent maddened him.
He glanced around him on leaving the <q>Tavistock</q>
and could see nothing of the fellow.</p>

<p><said>Why isn't he here on the look out?</said> he muttered
wrathfully.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to him that his anger was unreason-
able. If Ralstone had gone out, as Gregory said, was
it not the spy's duty to follow him? Pacified by the
thought he wended his way back to the Albany, calling
on his road at the <q>White Horse Cellars,</q> Piccadilly,
to inquire the latest odds on a horse he fancied was
likely to win at Goodwood.</p>

<p><said>Vicary's waiting to see you, sir,</said> were the words
with which Benham greeted him.</p>

<p><said>Ha, send him up.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas was pacing his room when the spy
entered.</p>

<p><said>Well, what have you found out?</said></p>

<p><said><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone isn't nearly as ill as I thought. He
left the <q>Tavistock</q> about one o'clock, and I followed
him. He took a hackney coach in the Strand, and I
was after him in another. He was set down in Berkeley
Square, and went into a house—No. 62.</said></p>

<p>It was the Duke of Endsleigh's mansion. Then Lady
<pb n="151"/>
Barbara had succeeded in enticing him to her presence!
This was good news, and a grim smile curved the
baronet's lips.</p>

<p><said>Did you wait until he came out?</said></p>

<p><said>Certainly, Sir Phineas.</said></p>

<p><said>How long did he stay?</said></p>

<p><said>Quite an hour and a half.</said></p>

<p>This also was good. What wiles could not a clever
woman exercise over a man in an hour and a half?</p>

<p><said>And what became of him after that?</said></p>

<p><said>He went back to the <q>Tavistock.</q></said></p>

<p>So all seemed to be going well.</p>

<head type="main">A Woman's Wiles</head>

<p>Lady Barbara's letter, couched in such appealing terms,
sent a chill over Jack Ralstone. It could not have
arrived at a less opportune moment. Before he opened
it he was in the freshness of an entrancing dream of
love, such as comes but once in a man's existence. He
was in the full flush of adolescence, when all that is best
and charming in a woman is tinged with the rosy light
of romance. To know that the girl whom he had never
forgotten, of whom he had constantly thought, to whom
he had been irresistibly drawn, whose disappearance
had left such a blank in his life, had come back, more
divine because more mysterious, seemed to him nothing
short of a miracle. Exultantly he looked forward to
the time when he should see her again.</p>

<p>Ever since he had been in London the time had gone
with him feverishly, in a sort of make-believe. He had
plunged into the life which he had once thought was
an ideal existence—the life of a man about town, or a
man with sporting tastes, free, independent, irre-
sponsible. If he kicked over the traces—well, there
would be no vicious intention; nothing more than the
outcome of high spirits—an outlet for buoyant vitality.</p>

<p>But it had all turned out differently. He found little
<pb n="152"/>
real pleasure in the amusements of London. When he
went to the theatre his attention wandered. Macready
bored him. Liston was amusing, and Madame Vestris
and Maria Foots <choice><corr>delightful</corr><orig>delighful</orig></choice>, but before the end of the
performance came he lost interest, and he was at a loss
to know why. At least, so he told himself. But the
fact was, he was ashamed to confess that he was guilty
of the weakness of constantly thinking of a pair of dark
lustrous eyes, of an exquisite oval face and olive-tinted
complexion, of fascinating lines of beauty—from the
ear to the chin, in the sweep of the neck to the shoulders,
in the charmingly moulded arms and wrists.</p>

<p>His scruples and self-reproaches vanished at the sight
of the girl. He was another man. He was no longer
discontented and dissatisfied for no apparent reason.
He had, in short, discovered that he was in love. But
even now his feelings were more or less vague. They
were brought to a crisis by Lady Barbara's <choice><corr>disquieting</corr><orig>disqueting</orig></choice>
letter.</p>

<p>What was the proper course to take as an honourable
man? Really he could not make up his mind. The
plain facts were that he and Lady Barbara had been
engaged, that neither of them cared for the other, that
her ladyship had shown herself indifferent to him at the
Bath masquerade, and a decided preference for Sir
Phineas Tenbury, in itself an unpardonable piece of
frivolity, considering Tenbury's questionable reputation.
Remembering all this, Jack Ralstone argued that the
fault was on the lady's side, and that her <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="roman">fiancé</foreign> was
quite justified in being offended. Whether she knew
he had told his stepfather he had broken his engage-
ment, and that in consequence he had been sent adrift,
Ralstone could not say, but since the night when she
so markedly slighted him, she had made no sign of
regrets or excuses. Then there was Lord Walsham's
story of her openly flirting at Almack's with Sir
Phineas, and her complete indifference as to what might
be thought and said of her conduct.</p>

<p><said>And now, hang it, she wants me to come back as
if nothing had happened!</said> cried Ralstone hotly.
<said>Does she think I'm a spaniel she only needs to whistle
<pb n="153"/>
to and he at once comes to heel? Deuce take her airs
and graces, her whims and fancies! She's chosen her
man, let her stick to him.</said></p>

<p>The outburst was probably justifiable. It was cer-
tainly very comforting to his outraged feelings, but
it did not answer the question what was he to do.
Some kind of reply must be made. The matter could
not be allowed to drift—especially as the girl with the
dark eyes had intervened. The point was, should he
write to Lady Barbara or go and see her, and thrash
out the matter once and for all?</p>

<p><said>Dashed if I know. Anyhow, I won't worry over
the business to-night. I'll sleep on it,</said> was his con-
clusion.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, but although, as Gregory said, he
was sleeping as peacefully as a child when the hotel
valet went into his room the next morning, it was some
time before he went to sleep. In spite of his vow not
to worry, he worried all the same.</p>

<p>He awoke with the bright sunshine full on his face,
and he struggled out of bed. A long and painful toilet
with the valet's assistance, the attentions of the doctor,
the skilful manipulation of Gregory in disguising his
undoubted black eye, his bath and the replacement of
his soiled and tattered garments by others, worked
wonders. When he looked at himself in the glass he
was agreeably surprised to find that he was fairly
presentable. With the pardonable vanity of youth he
regarded his appearance as very important, for he had
come to the opinion that he ought to see Barbara face
to face.</p>

<p>But not then. He was so stiff he could hardly drag
one leg after the other. His nerves had had a nasty
jar, and he was not in a fit state for what could not
be other than a painful and trying interview. For all
that, he rather dreaded an interchange of letters which
might fail to change the situation. He felt he must
convince Lady Barbara by word of mouth that their
engagement no longer existed. The only way out was
to send her a polite note to the effect that owing to an
accident he would have to keep indoors for a few days,
<pb n="154"/>
and that he would write and make an appointment
directly he was well enough to keep it.</p>

<p>This note, short as it was, took him some time to
write, but at last it was done and dispatched. What
effect it would have on the lady he could only con-
jecture, for she sent him no reply.</p>

<p>He was certainly wise in resting. Three or four days
went over before he could say he was fairly fit, and even
then his bruised face had not quite resumed its normal
appearance. Had he not been blessed with a splendid
constitution his period of seclusion would have lasted
much longer.</p>

<p>All the time he was invalided the prospect of a
<soCalled>scene</soCalled> with Lady Barbara worried him, but it had
to be faced, and having written that he would wait
upon her the following afternoon, he set out at the hour
fixed and took a hackney coach, as Vicary did not fail
to note, which set him down at the Duke of Endsleigh's
house in Berkeley Square. He gave his name to
a footman, and when the man returned with the
message that Lady Barbara was at home and would see
him, he could not decide whether he was pleased or
sorry.</p>

<p>Ralstone was not shown into the drawing-room or
library as he expected, but into a sort of boudoir, one
of a suite of rooms assigned to Lady Barbara, and fur-
nished and decorated in a style befitting the daughter
of a duke. Maybe the young man was inclined to be
critical—he had had so many disillusions of late that it
would not be extraordinary if he were—and it seemed
to him that the room reflected Lady Barbara's character-
istics and tastes. The panels were fitted with mirrors;
silk hangings of pale blue abounded; gilt adornments
were stuck wherever it was possible; the furniture was
in the Empire style, overlaid with florid ornamentation.
A faint perfume scented the air. All was artificial, gilt
and glitter.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened noiselessly, and Lady
Barbara glided in. She was dressed for the part. The
fine lady had disappeared. She affected the village
maiden, in her plain muslin dress, unflounced, with
<pb n="155"/>
short sleeves tied up with ribbon in shoulder-knot
fashion. Her arms were bare and her low corsage
displayed a liberal amount of bust. A cluster of white
roses backed by dark green leaves suggested virginal
innocence.</p>

<p>She hesitated, her fingers lingering on the door-handle
as though deriving support from the contact while she
gathered courage. Her eyes were downcast. As a
matter of fact, she was waiting to see what Ralstone
would do. Her aspect of maiden timidity should have
invited him to make the first advance, but it did not.
He stood motionless.</p>

<p>The slightest possible wrinkle showed itself between
her eyebrows. She was piqued by his immobility. It
was not that she cared for him as a lover, nor that she
expected him to behave like a lover, but as a man of
politeness he might have had the decency to show <emph>some</emph>
kind of feeling. Had she not metaphorically thrown
herself at his feet?</p>

<p>The silence was intolerable. She quitted the protest-
ing handle and went forward a step.</p>

<p><said>Have you nothing to say?</said> she broke out
agitatedly.</p>

<p><said>I hardly know. I came to hear what <emph>you</emph> had to
say. You invited me, you know.</said></p>

<p><said>Invited? How coldly you speak of my letter. If
you only knew what it cost me to write it! Couldn't
you see it came from my heart? And you talk of it as
if it were an invitation to dinner!</said></p>

<p><said>I didn't look at it in that light, I assure you. It
puzzled—it surprised me. It seemed to me that you
wrote it without knowing what had passed between me
and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Halstead. I could hardly think that.</said></p>

<p>If ever Lady Barbara needed the actress's art it was
at that moment. Of course she knew, but she was not
going to confess that she did. She tried to stare at
Ralstone in blank astonishment. It was not altogether
a successful effort.</p>

<p><said>You talk in riddles,</said> said she. <said>If you were sur-
prised and puzzled, what about me? What excuse
have you to make for your neglect? Not a word from
<pb n="156"/>
you since that night. How many weeks ago is it? An
age to me, at all events.</said></p>

<p><said>It wasn't neglect,</said> he rejoined bluntly. <said>It was
what would naturally follow from what I told the
Squire.</said></p>

<p><said>And what <emph>did</emph> you tell him?</said> she cried, clasping
her hands and with a note of passion in her voice which
was not altogether simulated. She was fast working
herself into a rage, for she foresaw failure.</p>

<p><said>That our engagement was a great mistake and that
our marriage would be a fatal one. You didn't care
for me and I didn't care for you. You know that, Lady
Barbara, as well as I do. The business was arranged
by the Squire and the Duke. Neither you nor I had
a say in the matter. I suppose but for things happen-
ing outside we should both have gone on blindly. But
my eyes were opened.</said></p>

<p><said>Over my silly pet at the masquerade?</said></p>

<p><said>Well—yes.</said></p>

<p>His momentary hesitation exposed a vulnerable
point in his armour, of which woman's uncanny penetra-
tion in matters of the heart instantly took advantage.</p>

<p><said>Or was it your other lady love?</said></p>

<p>Ralstone was no hand at the game of Cupid's thrust
and parry. He could not conceal his discomfiture.
The attack was so unexpected that he hardly knew
what to say. What had Lady Barbara heard? How
could he tell that the question put so adroitly and with
such confidence was simply a flash of a feminine weapon
against which a man is helpless?</p>

<p><said>I don't know what you mean. I've no other lady
love. Perhaps it would be more correct to say I've
no lady love at all.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara was now quivering with anger. All
thought of the fascinations which were to bring Ralstone
back had vanished. Up to this point she had lingering
hopes that she might save the situation, but Ralstone's
evident embarrassment when tackled about the <q>other
woman</q> had sent them to the winds. She could have
endured his refusing to marry her because of it being
a mere matter of arrangement. A <foreign xml:lang="fr">mariage de con-
<pb n="157"/>
venance</foreign> was common enough. The example furnished
by the Prince Regent and Caroline of Brunswick, and
its culmination the miserable squabble at the corona-
tion in Westminster Abbey, when the King employed
a body of prize-fighters, with Jackson at their head, to
guard his sacred person, were fresh in the public mind,
and there were hosts of other instances of ill-assorted
marriages among the aristocracy. Lady Barbara was
quite willing to take the risk now that the want of
money had forced her hand.</p>

<p>But her vanity was touched at the thought of a rival.
She would make one more effort, not so much with the
object of winning over Ralstone as of gratifying herself
—of asserting the power of her own charms. It was
humiliating to think that she had been supplanted by
another woman.</p>

<p>Suddenly she pulled out her handkerchief and dabbed
her eyes. A sob burst from her, real enough, though
it was a sob of anger rather than of anguish; she
tottered towards him, sank upon the couch in a
picturesque attitude, and buried her face in the pillow,
a lovely picture of beauty in distress.</p>

<p>It was a little overdone, and to Jack Ralstone,
unused to heroics in private life, it seemed a trifle
theatrical. Sobs and gasps from Lady Barbara, who
had always been so cold, who had hardly gone nearer
to familiarity than the exhibition of a kind of stately
condescension, did not appear natural. It was what
might have been expected from an emotional country
maiden, disappointed in her first love affair, but from
the haughty and high-born Lady Barbara, no.</p>

<p>But his doubts did not help to extricate him from an
embarrassing position. She had not, in his opinion,
righted herself. She had not satisfactorily accounted
for her relations with Sir Phineas. She had made
matters worse by the innuendo she had thrown out
concerning another woman. The sneer angered him,
possibly because there was a measure of truth in the
accusation.</p>

<p>All this rushed through his mind while he was trying
to decide whether he should offer consolation or main-
<pb n="158"/>
tain a stony indifference. He had naturally rather a
tender heart, and her apparent self-abandonment was
beginning to touch him. He might have yielded to his
sympathetic impulses had not Lady Barbara been so
impatient. As he did not immediately throw himself
on his <choice><corr>knees</corr><orig>kness</orig></choice>, call himself a hard-hearted monster and
beg forgiveness, she came to the conclusion that the
tactics of pathos had failed. Besides, the tears would
not come. She sprang to her feet, came quite close to
him, stretched out both hands and looked up im-
ploringly. If ever a pair of blue eyes asked for a kiss,
Lady Barbara's did just then.</p>

<p><said>Can't we forget all our silly quarrel and begin again
as if nothing had happened?</said> she murmured brokenly.</p>

<p><said>The quarrel doesn't strike me as silly. I suppose
we ought to have an eye to the future,</said> he was begin-
ning, when she put her hand over his mouth.</p>

<p><said>Oh, how dreadfully solemn! I hate to talk about
the future. It reminds me of being in church,</said> she
exclaimed, quite determined that he should not treat the
matter seriously.</p>

<p><said>Very well, then we'll take the present. The position
is that old Halstead has, so to speak, kicked me out of
his house because I told him I didn't think our engage-
ment ought to continue. I haven't a feather to fly with.
That doesn't sound very attractive, does it?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I know all about that. Let me tell you that
we've only got to make it up and everything would be
well again,</said> she cried eagerly.</p>

<p><said>Really? I understood from your ladyship just
now that you were quite ignorant of what has passed
between me and my stepfather. How is it you're so
certain he'll go back on his word?</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara was dumbfounded. She had made a
frightful slip, and how to retrieve her error was not
very clear to her.</p>

<p><said>Oh, it's only my impression,</said> she faltered. <said>In
any case, I'm quite willing to risk <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Halstead altering
his mind, if you are.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone was silent. An ugly thought had flashed
across his brain. It suddenly occurred to him that
<pb n="159"/>
Lady Barbara had much to gain by marrying him and
restoring Simon Halstead's good humour. Had not
Simon promised to hand over thirty thousand pounds
to the duke on their marriage day?</p>

<p><said>I can't make out why you should think so,</said> he
rejoined presently. <said>I fancy I know more about
Simon Halstead's obstinacy than you do. We'd better
look at the thing fairly and squarely, Lady Barbara.
It's impossible you can marry a man who hasn't a
penny in his pocket.</said></p>

<p>Secure in her belief that, once married to Jack
Ralstone, his stepfather would relent, she laughed in-
credulously.</p>

<p><said>If that's your only objection, I don't see that there's
much in it. I love you. Don't you know that?</said></p>

<p><said>It comes as news to me,</said> he answered coldly.</p>

<p><said>But I do,</said> she persisted.</p>

<p>He did not believe her, but he could hardly say so.
He was anxious to avoid any further unpleasantness.
All he wanted was to say good-bye and take his de-
parture. He would rather they parted as friends, but
it was not so easy in the face of her intense desire for
reconciliation. Her change of attitude puzzled him.
He had always thought her cold, haughty and vain,
and the emotion of that day had not materially altered
his opinion. Indeed, the suggestion that she was also
mercenary had strengthened it. Short of a blunt and
emphatic refusal to marry her, it looked as if nothing
would convince her that he was in earnest.</p>

<p>He was reluctant to take this course unless she gave
him a chance of doing it naturally, and a crisis of this
kind she seemed carefully to avoid.</p>

<p><said>I take what you say as the greatest compliment
you can pay me,</said> said he awkwardly. <said>But——</said></p>

<p><said>Only a compliment? A woman's love?</said> she in-
terposed scornfully.</p>

<p><said>When I can't return it, what else can I say? If
it be true——</said></p>

<p><said>It <emph>is</emph> true. Do you suppose I should so humble
myself if it weren't?</said></p>

<pb n="160"/>

<p><said>I accept your word, but it makes it all the more
necessary I should tell you the risk you run.</said></p>

<p>He spoke desperately. It was the last argument he
had short of being what might be termed brutal.</p>

<p><said>Risk? Didn't I tell you that I was willing to face
any risk?</said></p>

<p><said>The risk of poverty, yes, but not the risk of wasting
your love on one who in a few weeks time may cease to
exist.</said></p>

<p><said>Good heavens, what are you talking about?
Surely you don't contemplate making away with
yourself?</said></p>

<p><said>Nothing so silly. I'm going to fight a duel.</said></p>

<p><said>Only that? Duels are fought every day, and not
much harm's done. It's all very absurd. Just an
exchange of bullets and honour's satisfied. I suppose
men have no other way of settling their quarrels. May
I ask with when you're going to fight?</said></p>

<p><said>Some one in whom you're interested—unless I'm
doing you an injustice—Sir Phineas Tenbury.</said></p>

<p>The colour fled from Lady Barbara's cheeks. She
stared mutely at Ralstone. His words seemed to have
paralysed her speech.</p>

<p><said>It will probably be not the harmless affair you
infer,</said> went on Ralstone. <said>I shouldn't have mentioned
the matter to you. but I thought it only right to warn
you after the declaration of your affection with which
you've honoured me. Obviously it would be wise of
you to turn your thoughts elsewhere. In the event
of the duel having a fatal termination so far as I'm
concerned, you'd be saved a deal of distress.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone spoke with a stiffness and formality which
did not come naturally to him, but he did so purposely,
as he was anxious to avoid a repetition of hysterical
emotion. To his relief Lady Barbara showed no
symptoms of anything of the kind. The shock had
passed away. She exhibited no resentment at the
mention of Tenbury's name, as he expected, and her
face betrayed an eager interest which puzzled him. The
truth was she felt immensely flattered. A duel between
Sir Phineas and Ralstone could have connection with
<pb n="161"/>
no one other than <choice><corr>herself</corr><orig>hersef</orig></choice>. It gratified her vanity. She
felt almost grateful to Ralstone. If he were not in love
with her, he was ready to die for her.</p>

<p><said>Oh, you mustn't meet Sir Phineas,</said> she cried.
<said>I've heard terrible stories about him as a duellist.
I don't mean that he doesn't fight fair, but he's a deadly
shot.</said></p>

<p><said>I know. It makes no difference.</said></p>

<p><said>But cannot it be settled without fighting?</said></p>

<p><said>No; the cause of quarrel is too serious.</said></p>

<p><said>What is it all about? Is there a lady in it?</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara asked the question with as much
indifference as she could assume. She was in reality
burning to have her suspicions confirmed.</p>

<p><said>You'd better ask Sir Phineas,</said> was Ralstone's
reply.</p>

<p><said>No. I'd prefer to have it from your own lips.
Sir Phineas is nothing to me.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone could not prevent himself from raising his
eyebrows slightly. The suggestion of incredulity
angered the lady.</p>

<p><said>I'm sorry I'm not in a position to give you any
information.</said></p>

<p><said>But I've a right to know—that is, if it concerns
me.</said></p>

<p><said>Make your mind easy. Your ladyship has nothing
to do with our quarrel. You can't reproach yourself
if it so happens that I come to grief.</said></p>

<p>It would have been hard to find anything which
would have served Ralstone's desire to close the dis-
cussion so well as the turn the talk had taken. The
wound from which her vanity was already suffering
was a mere scratch compared with what it had now
received.</p>

<p><said>Then you two are fighting over some other woman,</said>
she almost shrieked, her lips tremulous with rage.</p>

<p><said>I can only refer you to Sir Phineas Tenbury,</said>
returned Ralstone with a low bow.</p>

<p><said>Oh, you're driving me mad! Every time I talk to
you, you heap fresh insults upon me. Yes, you're
right, you'd make a wretched husband. I've mercifully
<pb n="162"/>
refrained from saying anything personal, but I don't
see why I should now have any scruple. You look in
anything but a fit state for presenting yourself before
a lady. I suppose you've been in some vulgar street
row. I believe you Corinthians, as you call yourselves,
glory in your familiarity with all that's low in London.
Please go back to your boon companions. I've done
with you.</said></p>

<p>Jack Ralstone said not a word. He was only too
glad to get away from the enraged lady. He again
bowed and walked to the door, pursued by vituperations
which amazed him, coming as they did from the
daughter of a duke. But it was a robust age. When
men—and women too—let themselves go, they did so
with a vengeance.</p>

<p><said>Phew!</said> ejaculated Ralstone, when he was in the
square. <said>I now know something about her ladyship's
temper. I'd heard she'd a pretty rough side to her
tongue, and by gad, it's true. A beautiful termagant!
What an escape for me! I'm deucedly obliged to old
Simon. If he hadn't cup up nasty I might still be
dangling after my lady. But she's a bit of a mystery.
How does Sir Phineas stand with her? I thought she
looked mighty queer when I told her I was going to
fight him. Is there really anything between the pair?
Thank goodness, it's no affair of mine.</said></p>

<p>The feeling of relief now that he was free from en-
tanglement produced an exhilaration which made him
forget his aches and pains, and he was tempted to walk
back to Covent Garden. There was another reason,
and a more important one, why he should walk. He
had but a shilling in his pocket. He became suddenly
serious. He had come to the end of his resources and
would have to consider what he should do.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lady Barbara was in what the servants
called her <soCalled>tantrums.</soCalled> Directly Ralstone had de-
parted she rushed to her bedroom, rang furiously for
her maid, tore the white roses from her bosom and
trampled upon them, and did not wait for the Abigail
to help her to take off the muslin dress, the sight of
which accentuated her rage. But though the maid came
<pb n="163"/>
as quickly as she could, knowing what the sound of the
bell meant, she was welcomed with a sound box on the
ear for her alleged dilatoriness.</p>

<p>Then, when Lady Barbara's anger had somewhat
spent itself, she sat down and wrote a frenzied note
to Sir Phineas, which she dispatched to the Albany
by a groom.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas was congratulating himself that all was
going on well when he received Lady Barbara's disturb-
ing missive.</p>

<p><q>I must see you at once about something
important concerning yourself and Jack Ralstone.
I shall be at Matthews's at nine. On no account fail
me.—B.</q></p>

<p><said>Humph,</said> muttered Sir Phineas, frowning as he
crumpled the note and then tore it into fragments.
<said>A <q>B</q> with a sting.</said></p>

<head type="main">Vicary gets his Deserts</head>

<p>Ralstone reached the <q>Tavistock</q> quite done up. The
interview with Lady Barbara had tried his nerves, and
the walk from Berkeley Square, in his shaken condition,
had not been a less severe ordeal. He was glad to find
the cheery Walsham in the coffee-room awaiting his
return.</p>

<p><said>My dear fellow,</said> cried Walsham, <said>I've been horribly
concerned about you. It relieved my mind when
Gregory told me you had been brought here fairly
safely—a bit battered but otherwise not much the
worse. By Jove it was a near thing. What the deuce
did it mean? You were the mark. Somebody had
a grudge against you. Who was it? That devil
Thurtell?</said></p>

<p><said>Of course it was. He was frightfully savage at
being licked after his boasting. I'm told he's as vain
as a peacock. That sneakish fellow I pointed out to
you must have been in his pay.</said></p>

<pb n="164"/>

<p>Walsham shook his head.</p>

<p><said>Wait a moment,</said> said he. <said>I called at Bow Street
this morning and had a talk with some of the <soCalled>Robin
Redbreasts</soCalled> (Bow Street runners)—I know Ruthven
and one or two more. I mentioned that spy fellow
and they laughed at the idea of his being employed
by Thurtell. They know the blackguard quite well
and have seen him hanging about here. He was one
of the <q>common informers</q> a few years ago, and was
always at Bow Street swearing away the liberty of some
poor fellow who couldn't pay him to keep his tongue
to himself. In whose service do you think he's been for
many months past?</said></p>

<p><said>How on earth can I tell. Old Satan's I should
imagine, from what you say.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I've no doubt the devil's been at his back, but
just now his master is Sir Phineas Tenbury.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone slapped his thigh.</p>

<p><said>By gad that's it!</said> he cried. <said>I knew I'd seen
the scoundrel somewhere. I threatened to kick him
out of my room at the <q>George,</q> Andover, for his
insolence. At a matter of fact that was the beginning
of my difference with Tenbury. But why should
Tenbury set him to watch me? The next time I see
the rascal I'll drag the truth out of him.</said></p>

<p><said>You'll get nothing but lies. At the same time, it's
an infernal nuisance to feel you're being spied upon.</said></p>

<p><said>An infernal nuisance? Yes, and I won't stand it.
I did think Tenbury had some remains of a gentleman
about him, but it doesn't look like it. If I hadn't
already quarrelled with him this would be enough to
make me call him out. He owes me four thousand
pounds, and never a word of explanation have I had
why he doesn't pay up like a man of honour.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm told that the City bill discounters won't look at
his paper. The Jews are at him like a pack of hounds
round a fox. By the way, my dear Jack, how did you
fare that night? Did the rabble rob you?</said></p>

<p><said>Rob me? I was left with nothing. I'm in the deuce
of a fix in consequence. I can't stay much longer here.
<pb n="165"/>
I already owe the <q>Tavistock</q> people a pretty stiff
bill.</said></p>

<p><said>I feared as much. Look here, if a couple of <soCalled>ponies</soCalled>
are any good, you're quite welcome. I've been fairly
lucky of late.</said></p>

<p><said>You're a good chap, Walsham, but I don't like taking
your money. How the deuce am I to pay you back?</said></p>

<p><said>That doesn't matter a rap. I don't expect you'll
be always hard up. There's my motion of a rich wife
still on the cards, that is, if you're quite free of Lady
Barbara Dacre.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, that's all off—finally. I settled the matter an
hour ago. She wrote me a most extraordinary letter—
for her—making out she was heart-broken——</said></p>

<p>Walsham burst into a laugh.</p>

<p><said>What! Has Sir Phineas said good-bye?</said></p>

<p><said>I don't know. The whole business is very bewilder-
ing. I went to see her—I couldn't well get out of it—
there was a bit of a scene—she kicked up a frightful
row; the end was I came away, and I suppose we're
now daggers drawn. So much the better.</said></p>

<p><said>I congratulate you. Well, there are the <soCalled>ponies.</soCalled>
If you want any more, tell me.</said></p>

<p>The young lord took a couple of twenty-pound notes
from his pocket-book and pushed them across the table.
Ralstone took them with evident reluctance.</p>

<p><said>If I could screw out of that fellow Weare the hun-
dred pounds he owes me, I could pay at once,</said> said he
a little gloomily.</p>

<p><said>You'd better consider Weare as a rotten egg. I
asked the Bow Street men about him, and they give
him a thundering bad character. He poses as a money-
lender, and no doubt he does a bit that way, but he
does more in gambling, with a little card sharping
thrown in. Runs a gambling booth on race courses.
He's to be seen every night at Rexworthy's gambling
hell in Spring Gardens. He and Thurtell just now are
as thick as thieves. Ruthven thinks their friendship
will end in Thurtell being rooked. He's more fool than
knave, but when he's wound up there's no telling what
he won't do.</said></p>

<pb n="166"/>

<p><said><foreign xml:lang="la">Ecce signum</foreign> at the Fives Court for instance.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes. You scored, but he very nearly did for you
outright.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone did not answer. His eyes were bent
absently on the floor. He hadn't had time to think
over his affairs, and the present was certainly not
suitable; for all that a disturbing feeling crept over
him, that the sooner he pulled himself together the
better. He was brought to realities by Walsham
giving him a rousing slap on the shoulder.</p>

<p><said>What are you dreaming about? I've made two
splendid suggestions and you've not taken the slightest
notice.</said></p>

<p><said>I beg your pardon. What were they?</said></p>

<p><said>One that we should dine at Boodle's, where you'll
have really a decent dinner, much better than the
stodgy fare of the <q>Tavistock,</q> and that afterwards
we should go to the King's Theatre. The ballet's worth
seeing. You'll have a sight of some handsome women
who know how to dance. Doesn't the prospect tempt
you?</said></p>

<p><said>Not to-night, my friend. I'm rather afraid of
your dinners unless I'm in good fettle, and I'm not that
just now.</said></p>

<p><said>Maybe you're right. Anyhow, I'm not going to
let you off. To-morrow night—what do you say?</said></p>

<p><said>Perhaps. I'll see how I feel. A chop here and a
pint of claret quietly is more my form.</said></p>

<p>Walsham shrugged his shoulders and remarked that
Ralstone's diet suggested that he was training for a
prize fight.</p>

<p><said>I may even have to do that. I'm at my wit's end
how to make money.</said></p>

<p><said>You're a bit hipped, my dear fellow. You'll take
a different view of life to-morrow after a good night's
rest.</said></p>

<p>Walsham sat chatting for some little time and then
took his departure, leaving Ralstone to get over his fit
of the blues by himself.</p>

<p>As sometimes happen when the spirits are depressed,
all one's worries come tumbling one after the other into
<pb n="167"/>
the brain, and this was just now with Jack Ralstone.
His severance from Simon Halstead, and what that
severance meant—the necessity of doing something,
not merely to keep up his reputation among his friends
as a Corinthian, but to live decently—the puzzling
behaviour of Lady Barbara—the amazing <choice><corr>reappearance</corr><orig>reapparance</orig></choice>
of the girl who chose to call herself Amelia Hart—her
mysterious reference to Simon Halstead, pointing as it
did to some secret resentment—the outrageous assault
upon him by Thurtell's gang, and the duel with Tenbury
and its problematical ending—really his troubles were
overwhelming.</p>

<p>As a rule his buoyancy was sufficient to enable him
to laugh at difficulties, but he had never had such
difficulties as these to surmount. Possibly it was the
uncertainty clouding them, the impossibility of ex-
plaining everything to his satisfaction which weighed
him down, but whether or not, there he sat brooding
until the waiter asked him if he intended to dine and
what he would like.</p>

<p><said>Oh, anything—anything. Don't bother me. Bring
me whatever is ready,</said> he rapped out irritably.</p>

<p>The waiter vanished. It did not surprise him that
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jack Ralstone, who was generally inclined to a
joke, should be out of temper. Of course he hadn't
recovered from the effects to the Fives Court adventure,
though it was marvellous how his youth and vigorous
constitution had thrown off any serious trouble. Word
was passed down to the kitchen to look after the <q>brave
young gentleman,</q> and the cook did her best to serve
up two or three dainty dishes. Her efforts, together
with a pint of Burgundy, succeeded to some extent in
restoring the young gentleman's equanimity.</p>

<p>But he was not nearly himself. He felt terribly
restless. The stuffiness of the coffee-room, with its
whiffy memories of innumerable dinners and diners,
was intolerable. It was impossible to ponder over his
worries inside the hotel, and he sallied forth to walk
himself into an equable humour.</p>

<p>His intention was dashed at the very outset. He
had hardly got to the corner of James Street when he
<pb n="168"/>
saw the spy lurking at his favourite spot under the
colonnade opposite. Instantly Ralstone's smouldering
passion flared up and he strode across the road. The
fellow saw him coming and spotting danger was slinking
away, when he heard the words:</p>

<p><said>Stop, you. I've got something to say before you
sneak off.</said></p>

<p>The man pretended not to hear, but he dared not
run for fear of attracting attention. Before a minute
elapsed the irate young man was by his side, and glad
of the chance to vent his feelings, had brought down a
heavy hand on his shoulder; he found himself twisted
round and faced by as threatening a look as ever he
had set eyes upon, and this was saying a good deal, for
many a time Vicary had had to use his wits to escape
the thrashing that he deserved.</p>

<p><said>What's your game in watching me, you rascal?
Have you taken up your old dirty trade of informer?</said></p>

<p>Vicary's white face became of an unwholesome pasty
hue. His forehead was damp and his knees knocked
against each other. Ralstone was holding him by the
collar at arm's length, and the young man's knuckles
were grinding into his neck.</p>

<p><said>Let me go, sir,</said> he implored, <said>you're choking me.</said></p>

<p><said>I hope so. I'm only anticipating what, I'll swear,
Jack Ketch will do to you some day. Your answer—
quick—or I'll roll you in that muck heap.</said></p>

<p>The sweepings of the market were piled up close to
the kerb. There had been a little rain, and it was as
foul and as unsavoury a mass of vegetable offal as could
be found anywhere outside the Fleet Ditch.</p>

<p><said>I've no game at all, sir. You're greatly mistaken.
I have a perfect right to w—walk here, sir,</said> he splut-
tered.</p>

<p><said>Don't talk to me about your rights. If you're at
all curious over the subject I'll show you what they
are.</said></p>

<p>The hands shifted from the coat collar to the neck
and he felt like a rat in the jaws of a terrier, shaken as
he was till he was gasping and nearly black in the face.</p>

<p><said>Are your muddy brains any clearer?</said> demanded
<pb n="169"/>
his torturer, ceasing the pressure and the shaking to
permit his victim to speak. <said>Why has your master
sent you here to spy?</said></p>

<p><said>My m—master, sir? I don't know what you're
talking about.</said></p>

<p><said>You know very well whom I mean. None of your
lies. We've met before. At Andover. I ought to
have kicked you then for your insolence, but the kicking
will keep. What dirty work is Sir Phineas employing
you for now?</said></p>

<p>The man probably saw that it was useless trying to
keep up his pretended ignorance. He mumbled out
sullenly:</p>

<p><said>You'd better ask Sir Phineas. It's no affair of mine.
I never ask questions.</said></p>

<p><said>That's enough for me. You can tell your employer
that if he wishes to watch me, he'd better act as his
own spy. I shall treat him as I'm now treating his
underling.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone's grip on the fellow's throat tightened and
Vicary became horribly frightened. He really thought
he was going to be strangled. But his captor had no
such intention. Vicary struggled violently to free
himself, and Ralstone gradually backed him towards
the muck heap and then suddenly let go and gave him
a slight push. Vicary's body was bent; he was unable
to recover his perpendicular. and the next moment the
spy was spluttering and choking in the midst of the
muddy, rotten garbage. And there Ralstone left him
and walked on, feeling more satisfied with himself than
he'd been for many a day.</p>

<p>What became of the man he did not trouble to see.
He went towards King Street, where he had not been
since the night of the affray. He had been tempted
to revisit it more than once, but he would not run any
risks after the girl's warning. But now that he had
disposed of the spy, caution did not seem to matter.</p>

<p>He looked up as he passed the house. It was dark
from basement to attic. He dared not stop. The dis-
covery that the spy was in Sir Phineas Tenbury's
service had set him thinking. Clearly he had been on
<pb n="170"/>
the wrong tack in imagining the fellow was employed
by Thurtell. What could be Tenbury's object? Ral-
stone could only conceive that it had something to do
with the girl. Had he not, during their quarrel, asked
what he (Ralstone) had done with her? Sir Phineas
had refused to accept his denial, and what more likely
than that he should set his menial to work to find out
whether that denial was true or not?</p>

<p><said aloud="false">If it is so,</said> thought Jack, <said aloud="false">it'll mean another score
to wipe off. Anyway, I've settled that blackguard's
hash for to-night. He'll think twice before he shows
his face to me again.</said></p>

<p>With this conclusion in his mind he was half tempted
to turn back and call at the house. It would be quite
safe. But he decided not to do so. He remembered
her express injunction not to seek her.</p>

<p>It was about nine o'clock. The day had come to
an end. The lamplighter, shouldering his ladder, was
hurrying past, and the gas-lights, few and feeble, just
made Bedford Street, which he had now reached, visible.
He wandered down to the Strand and turned to the
east. The river, picturesque and romantic at twilight,
attracted him as a good setting for the waking dreams
of a man in love, and he was inclined to take a wherry
at the nearest stairs and be rowed about for an hour or
two.</p>

<p>But he altered his mind. There was the waterman
to be reckoned with. As a class the watermen were full
of gossip, and not infrequently full of beer. The river
at that time would he busy with boats full of noisy
pleasure seekers on their way to Vauxhall Gardens in
the west, and to Cherry Gardens, Rotherhithe, in the
east, and the watermen were certain to exchange
badinage more or less coarse. A risk of too many inter-
ruptions for one in his mood. So he kept on his way
until Somerset House hove in sight.</p>

<p>Waterloo Bridge, then one of the notable adornments
in London—it had only been opened some six years—
occurred to him. With its toll it promised a fair amount
of seclusion, and turning into Lancaster Place he reached
<pb n="171"/>
the turnstile, threw down his coin and sauntered on to
the bridge.</p>

<p>A <choice><corr>thunderstorm</corr><orig>thundersorm</orig></choice> had broken over the metropolis in
the afternoon and had cleared the air, a not unwelcome
change after several days of overpowering heat. The
opalescent sky, with its canopy of pale blue, was likely
to last unchanged until dawn. There was no moon
and only a few of the largest and brightest stars were
visible. This was not altogether a disadvantage, for
deep black shadows were absent and the even light
enabled distant objects to be fairly visible. Half-way
across the bridge he sat down on one of the alcoved
seats on the western side and listened vaguely to the
swirl of the flood tide rushing through the arches. The
shouts of the watermen and the strident laughter of
their men passengers mingled with the shrill giggles of
the women did not distract him.</p>

<p>His eyes wandered over the parapet and he took in the
varied scene with a quiet sense of pleasure. The
dominating feature was Westminster Abbey, far more
imposing than it appears to-day, for it was not dwarfed
by the present House of Parliament, nor cut in two by
the hideous Charing Cross railway bridge. The House
of Parliament of that day, with its squat square towers,
looked insignificant and commonplace by the side of the
venerable pile.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the surroundings he would
have found it hard to say exactly what were his reflec-
tions. He might at that moment be likened to Tom
Tug—<q>thinking of nothing at all.</q> He shifted his
position and turned his face eastward. A few pedes-
trians passed him, working people hurrying to their
homes on the Surrey side. A hackney coach lumbered
by—that was all the traffic. It never was great at any
time and less than ever after nightfall. Then the slim
figure of a young woman, closely veiled and her shawl
drawn tightly about her, tripped slowly along, not with
the tired preoccupied air of one who had been at work
all day, but rather as though she were out to enjoy the
air. <choice><corr>Ralstone's</corr><orig>Ralstone</orig></choice> eyes fell idly upon her and he hardly
gave her a thought.</p>

<pb n="172"/>

<p>About a dozen yards in her rear came a man who
walked quite unlike a Londoner. There was no slouch
of the body, no shuffle of the feet. He had the elasticity
of a man who had led an active outdoor life ever since
he was a crawling infant. Every movement suggested
that his muscles were like springs; they acted in perfect
harmony, with not an atom of the stiffness of the drill
sergeant. As he went by Ralstone saw that he was a
negro and Jack recognised him at once—Quamina.</p>

<p>Instantly the girl's words that she was greatly in-
debted to the black flashed across Ralstone's mind.
The thing was simple enough. Quamina was her body-
guard whenever she went out after dark for a constitu-
tional, and the veiled figure in front was she herself!</p>

<p><said>Fool!</said> he murmured, <said>not to know her at a glance.
And I call myself her lover!</said></p>

<p>He rose and in a few seconds was abreast of the negro.
He tapped the man lightly on the arm.</p>

</div>

<div n="17" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="17">XVII</num></head>
<head type="main">Nyra</head>

<p><said>My good fellow,</said> said Ralstone, <said>we've met before,
but I want you to make sure. Have a good look at me.</said>
Quamina wheeled round and fixed his black gleaming
eyes on the young Englishman. They were like the
eyes of a wild animal fearing an enemy at every turn.</p>

<p><said>Me not know massa.</said></p>

<p><said>What's the good of pretending you don't? Have
another look. Didn't you carry me in your arms into
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover's house in King Street when I didn't know
whether you were black or white? A week ago or so.
Don't you recollect?</said></p>

<p>The negro said nothing. He made some kind of
motion with his head. It might mean either yes or no.</p>

<p><said>You were a good friend to me then and I haven't
thanked you properly. Put this in your pocket.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone drew out a guinea and handed it to the
negro. The latter drew himself up proudly.</p>

<pb n="173"/>

<p><said>Quamina no take money, sah.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone stared in amazement. But he wasn't to be
put off.</p>

<p><said>I admire your independence, though why you should
stand on your dignity hang me if I can understand. If
you won't take money will you take my hand?</said></p>

<p><said>No, massa. Me no shake hands. Dat make me
your friend. I no friend.</said> His white teeth showed for
an instant, and the thick lips closed tightly upon them.</p>

<p><said>As you please. You're not like your mistress. I'm
going to speak to her and I'll swear she won't be as
ungracious as you are.</said></p>

<p><said>No, sah &#x2026;</said></p>

<p>Agile as a hare he had moved a step beyond Ralstone,
had wheeled round and was confronting him threaten-
ingly.</p>

<p><said>Oh, go to the devil!</said> shouted Ralstone at once,
losing his temper.</p>

<p><said>De debbil you say, sah?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, or the river. If you dare to stop me I'll pitch
you over the parapet.</said></p>

<p>The negro's reply was to seize Ralstone's arms. The
next moment the two men were writhing like a couple
of snakes. Had any of Jack's Corinthian friends been
present, they would have found it difficult to lay a bet
on either man. Not a blow was struck. It was a
wrestling match pure and simple. Ralstone was a
skilled wrestler, but he had found his equal. Not that
the negro knew anything about the Somersetshire, West-
morland or Cornish styles, but he was the possessor of
some curious <q>holds</q> and grips which rather bothered
the Englishman, used as he was to orthodox methods.
His efforts to <q>cross buttock</q> his opponent were con-
tinually frustrated. Any other way of getting free
seemed impossible, so ironlike was the grasp of the
black.</p>

<p>While they were bending backwards and forwards
like two saplings swayed by the wind, a sweet, penetrat-
ing voice was heard.</p>

<p><said>What mad trick are you trying, Quamina. Let go
at once. This is my business, not yours.</said></p>

<pb n="174"/>

<p>The negro obeyed sullenly. He dropped his hands
and glared savagely at Ralstone, who flushed and
panting with the severe struggle had his eyes fixed on
the girl. She had raised her veil and her face was
more enchanting and <choice><reg>witch-like</reg><orig>witchlike</orig></choice> than ever he had seen<!-- following later occurrence -->
it.</p>

<p><said>You are faithfully served,</said> said he between great
gasps of breath. <said>I can guess why your servant
tackled me. I'm afraid I was hasty. I told him I
would throw him into the river. I'm sorry. He took
me for one of your enemies. I'm not that, am I?</said></p>

<p><said>No. I've every reason to be grateful to you. Leave
us, Quamina.</said></p>

<p><said>Missie not cross?</said></p>

<p><said>No. You did what you thought was right, but
you were mistaken. Remember, this gentleman is my
friend and yours too.</said></p>

<p><said>I said as much as that, but he wouldn't have it,</said>
rejoined Ralstone. <said>It doesn't matter. I longed to
see you, and now that the chance has come, never mind
under what circumstances.</said></p>

<p>Quamina had retired a few paces. The two were face
to face.</p>

<p><said>I think we're safe from interruption here,</said> went on
Ralstone. <said>Shall we walk to the end of the bridge.
Your man can follow if it pleases you.</said></p>

<p>The girl bowed and spoke to the negro in foreign lingo.
They strolled on together for a minute or so, neither
saying a word. Ralstone was the first to break the
silence.</p>

<p><said>I was beginning to fear you would not keep your
promise. A week's gone over and you made no sign.
You had forgotten, I thought.</said></p>

<p><said>I did not forget. How could I? But it was
difficult. I had but one word and I could not bring
myself to write it. But now that I've met you I will try
to say it. Farewell.</said></p>

<p><said>Farewell? Surely—surely you don't mean <emph>that</emph>,</said>
stammered Ralstone, stating at her aghast.</p>

<p><said>Yes. It had to be said some time and the sooner
the better.</said></p>

<pb n="175"/>

<p><said>Why? In justice to me I ought to know.</said></p>

<p>She averted her head and was silent.</p>

<p>He came a little closer to her and would have slid his
arm within hers, but she gave him no encouragement.
She drew her shawl tighter and the garment furnished
an insurmountable barrier.</p>

<p><said>Am I to understand you refuse to tell me?</said> he
asked.</p>

<p><said>Not now. What has to be done must be done. I
suppose you'll know—or at least you'll guess—later on
when the time comes.</said></p>

<p><said>When will that be?</said></p>

<p><said>I can't say.</said></p>

<p><said>You mean you <emph>won't</emph> say,</said> he burst out savagely,
<said>I wish you'd clear up this mystery. But I suppose
you don't trust me. If you only knew what you are
to me——</said></p>

<p><said>I'm nothing to you,</said> she cried with bitterness in her
voice, <said>I'm only a waif and stray. And the work I've
set myself to do will make you hate me. That's why I
want you to pass out of my life and forget.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't intend to do the first, and as for the second,
that's impossible,</said> he returned doggedly. <said>I may be
very stupid, but I think I'm right in assuming from
what you hinted at when we last talked together that
your intention, whatever it might have been, was
altered when you imagined I was Simon Halstead's
son.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes,</said> she answered, but so faintly that he hardly
caught the sound.</p>

<p><said>And that on discovering I was not in any way
related to him, you went back to your original resolve?</said></p>

<p>She bowed her head.</p>

<p><said>Well?</said> he inquired impatiently, as though he
expected her to follow the lead she had given him,
<said>won't you solve the mystery?</said></p>

<p><said>No. It must remain where it is.</said></p>

<p>He bit his lips. Was there no way of overcoming her
firmness? He tried to look her in the face, but she
never gave him the chance. He could only see her
profile. In the mystic subdued light it was more like
<pb n="176"/>
inanimate marble than flesh and blood. But it was not
less beautiful on that account.</p>

<p><said>Do you know what has happened to me since I've
been in London? Something that concerns you.</said></p>

<p>She turned towards him involuntarily, her face full of
apprehension. It was the first time since they had
been talking that she showed any emotion.</p>

<p><said>Concerns me?</said> she faltered.</p>

<p><said>Yes, I've been watched every day, and every night
too, when it was possible, by a spy in the pay of Sir
Phineas Tenbury.</said></p>

<p>She clutched his arm agitatedly.</p>

<p><said><emph>That</emph> man?</said></p>

<p><said>Ah, I see this interests you. So much the better.
An hour or so ago I ran across the rascal and the result
of the interview was most satisfactory. I left him rolling
in the gutter. I doubt if the blackguard 'll be anxious
to spy upon me again.</said></p>

<p><said>But how did you know he had anything to do with
Sir Phineas Tenbury, and why should Sir Phineas spy
upon you?</said></p>

<p><said>As to your first question, you may take what I say
as the truth. As to your second, I have my suspicions,
but only you can verify them.</said></p>

<p><said>You spoke just now of my mystery,</said> she returned
after a pause. <said>Haven't you one of your own?</said></p>

<p><said>Maybe, but mine depends upon yours, or at least
upon part of yours. You told me the other night that
you dared not go out in the daytime for fear of some
man. When I mentioned Sir Phineas Tenbury's name
just now you shook with terror. I could feel your fingers
quivering. The answer to all this is perfectly plain.
Sir Phineas is the man you're afraid of. Let me have
the whole story and I'll explain why he should spy upon
me.</said></p>

<p><said>I feel reluctant to thrust my troubles on you.
You've done enough for me already and I can never
repay you, but——</said> she stopped hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Jack Ralstone was beginning to understand the ways
of women. By some curious instinct he felt that if
left to herself she would tell him far more than if he
<pb n="177"/>
sought to draw the facts from her, so he said nothing,
but contrived to insinuate his arm around her. She
made no protest, to his huge delight. His caress some-
how established a confidence to which she insensibly
yielded.</p>

<p><said>Oh, I <emph>must</emph> tell you,</said> she went on swiftly, as though
she felt that by delay the impulse to seek sympathy
would vanish. <said>Perhaps you ought to know, for it
was through that man I came to be with those horrible
people from whom you rescued me.</said></p>

<p>Again he was silent; the tender pressure of his arm
was a sufficient answer.</p>

<p><said>I came to England—never mind from what country
—about a year ago, with a set purpose in my mind. I
found myself without money and unable to move a step
towards accomplishing my object. I could sing, not
like your fine singers at our operas and concerts, but
in my own way. My songs are not like English or
Italian ones, but I suppose after a fashion they had some
novelty, for when I was desperate I went to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barnett,
the manager of Vauxhall Gardens, and he heard me sing
and at once gave me an engagement. I shall never
forget my first appearance. I was overwhelmed with
the splendour, the millions of lamps as they seemed, the
crowds of people with their faces turned upwards wait-
ing for me. When the music struck up to accompany
me I was overcome with nervousness and I saw myself
being hissed from the stage. Then I forgot everything
but the music of my country and I fancied myself back
again across the wide sea. I began—it was all a dream
—I sang my song right through, whether well or ill I
don't know, and I heard a great sound of the clapping
of hands and shouts. I had to sing my song over again.
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barnett said to me as I came off, <said>You'll do, little
one. You've made a hit.</said> After that I sang every
night and my name was in big letters on the bills.</said></p>

<p><said>Your name,</said> whispered Ralstone. <said>Yes, that's what
I want to know. I'll swear it isn't Amelia Hart.</said></p>

<p><said>No. It's Nyra Seaton. I used my Christian name
at Vauxhall. I wouldn't have done so—for reasons—
but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barnett took a fancy to it and insisted upon no
<pb n="178"/>
other. I suppose I was a great success, for I sang at
the Gardens until the winter months and was engaged
again in the spring. Then it was my persecution began.
Sir Phineas and his friends were constantly there and
he began to pursue me with his offensive attentions. I
was warned against the man, but there was no necessity
for warnings, I hated him from the very first and per-
sistently repulsed him and returned his presents.</said></p>

<p><said>The damned scoundrel,</said> muttered Ralstone under
his breath.</p>

<p><said>My coldness, my rudeness, my anger made no dif-
ference. He continued to insult me with his fulsome
flattery, his offers, his insinuations. At last I began to
be frightened. He swore he loved me passionately and
that nothing should ever turn him. He hinted at all
kinds of things and I had no one to protect me. Had
Quamina been with me I should have felt safer, but
Quamina, like myself, had his living to get, and he had
joined a boxing booth and was away in the country at
fairs and races. He is reckoned a splendid boxer.</said></p>

<p><said>So I should think,</said> said Ralstone, <said>if he fights as
well as he wrestles.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes. I was quite terrified when I saw you struggling
with him. But you are wonderful too, or he would have
dashed you to the ground.</said></p>

<p>Her eyes gleamed suddenly upon him. He thrilled
with pleasure, as much at the admiration expressed in
her face as in her words.</p>

<p><said>It's nice of you to say that. But you make me
jealous of Quamina. I want to serve you as he does.</said></p>

<p><said>You cannot. It's impossible,</said> she rejoined with
emphasis. <said>It was because he was not at my side, ever
ready to give his life for me, that all this trouble has
happened. He would have killed Sir Phineas.</said></p>

<p><said>I may have to do that,</said> put in Ralstone hastily.</p>

<p><said>No. I forbid you. I've escaped him and I want
to forget his hateful persecution. It is no affair of
yours.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone's lips contracted. He wondered what Nyra
—a delightful name Nyra he thought—would say if she
knew that it <emph>was</emph> his affair.</p>

<pb n="179"/>

<p><said>As you please—for the present. But I've stopped
your story. Do let me know the rest.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, it is soon told. I was leaving the Gardens late
one night when I was stopped by a couple of rough
men and an old woman. Before I could utter a cry for
help a cloak was thrown over my head and I was hurried
into some kind of closed vehicle. I struggled to no
purpose. Inside the coach or whatever it was I was
gagged and bound. Then the two men left me with
the old hag, climbed on to the box and the coach was
driven off at a great rate. The journey took several
hours during which the woman never said a word and I,
of course could not speak. We changed horses twice,
but I had no chance of appealing to the people at the
inn. It was nearly midday when the vehicle stopped,
and still gagged and blindfolded I was bundled out into
a caravan. One of the men drove away and the other,
with the old woman, followed me into the van. The
thing jogged on till the evening and was taken on to the
dreary common where you first saw me.</said></p>

<p><said>I thank Heaven I did. And the villainous plot was
hatched by that dastard Sir Phineas?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh yes. For a whole week I was kept a prisoner
and half starved. I believe firmly that this ill-treat-
ment was part of the plan to enfeeble me in mind and
body so that I might be forced into submission. They
were mistaken. I would have died first. One day not
a particle of food passed my lips, and in the evening,
quite unexpectedly, Sir Phineas made his appearance.
There was a scene between us. I drew my knife which
I had managed to conceal, and threatened to stab
myself. I suppose he saw that I meant to do it for he
let me alone and with a jeering laugh said he could wait,
and went away. The next morning I found that my
gaolers had searched for my knife and had taken it
away. My treatment after that was vilely cruel—you
saw something of it.</said></p>

<p><said>My God, yes. It made my blood boil.</said></p>

<p>Nyra paused. Her bosom heaved violently The
memory of that terrible time was evidently intensely
painful.</p>

<pb n="180"/>

<p><said>I never saw Sir Phineas after that,</said> she continued
with an effort. <said>And then my imprisonment and
torture came to an end—through you. Oh, whatever
happens I shall never forget your bravery. I could have
screamed with joy every time you struck that monster,
Jerry Winch.</said></p>

<p>She turned her face swiftly towards Ralstone. Tears
stood in her eyes. She put out her hand and he clasped
it warmly. She said nothing, but he understood how
anxious she was that he should think she was full of
gratitude.</p>

<p><said>And after what you've told me, do you still say that
the punishment of that scoundrel Tenbury is not my
affair?</said> he demanded reproachfully.</p>

<p><said>Yes, you've done enough.</said></p>

<p><said>Not nearly. I swear to you I shall have no peace
until I've brought the villain to his knees.</said> Ralstone's
voice, though low, vibrated with passion. His hand,
which still held hers, suddenly tightened. She winced.
He begged her pardon.</p>

<p><said>It's nothing,</said> she murmured faintly. She did not
contradict him and he was glad.</p>

<p><said>What happened to you after you ran from me?</said>
he asked presently.</p>

<p><said>I tramped all the way to London. I had no money,
the old woman had taken every penny. But she could
not take my voice, and at every town and village I sang
in the street, and the people gave me money. Some of
the villagers let me sleep in their cottages. It took me
a fortnight to walk to London. You see, I had to spend
some time in singing, and I went out of my way to go
through a town when I thought I might pick up a few
coins. I was at Windsor while a theatrical company
was playing, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover heard me singing, and
stopped and spoke. She was a good, kind creature,
and I had to tell her something of my story. When she
found I was <q>Nyra,</q> she insisted upon my going to her
house in King Street, and so I did, and there I've been
ever since. She knows why I daren't go out in the day-
time, but she doesn't know who my persecutor is. No
one knows but you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone.</said></p>

<pb n="181"/>

<p><said>Not even Quamina?</said></p>

<p><said>No. I'm afraid to tell him. He has all the savage
instincts of his race. It would mean his seeking out
Sir Phineas. He'd wait his opportunity and he'd use
his knife without scruple when his chance came. All
he knows is that I've enemies lying in wait for me, and
he doesn't pick and choose. My injuries are his. He
doesn't trouble to think that you may be my friend.
He hasn't the sense. Besides, he's very jealous of any-
body who notices me.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone saw that this being so, the negro might very
likely prove a source of trouble. He would have to be
cautious.</p>

<p><said>Do you walk here often?</said> said he.</p>

<p><said>Generally every night, if fine. You see, the bridge
is so quiet, and there are so few people. And I like to
look upon the river. I see in it something of myself.
When it's rough and tossing about the small boats,
indifferent whether it smashes them or not, it reminds
me of my own uncontrollable fits of passion. If it's
quiet, I'm placid and maybe sad. If the wind ruffles
the surface and the sun tips the waves and makes them
sparkle like diamonds, it shows me when I'm sanguine
and full of energy. Oh, yes, the river's very beautiful.</said></p>

<p><said>I understand. Would you be terribly offended if
I too walked on the bridgesome evenings?</said></p>

<p><said>It's as free for you as for me,</said> was her reply.</p>

<p><said>Thanks. But that tiresome champion of yours.
Must he be always with you?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes,</said> she answered quickly.</p>

<p><said>Oh,</said> said Ralstone in disappointed tone. <said>But
perhaps when he gets more used to me he won't be so
savage.</said></p>

<p><said>Used to you? How?</said></p>

<p><said>That's not so easy to say. So much depends upon
you. I want to see you again. I <emph>must</emph>. I want to
know more about you—it isn't mere curiosity, I swear.
There are reasons—important reasons; they have to
do with that scoundrel Tenbury.</said></p>

<p><said>In what way?</said> she asked a little agitatedly.</p>

<p><said>I can't tell you yet. Nothing is settled.</said></p>

<pb n="182"/>

<p>She fixed her eyes upon his face as if to read there
the meaning of his words, but his expression told her
nothing. It was grave, that was all.</p>

<p><said>I'm grateful for the interest you take in me,</said> said
she, slowly, <said>but I go back to what I started with. I
must say farewell.</said></p>

<p><said>You may say it if you please, but <emph>I</emph> don't.</said></p>

<p>He waited impatiently for her answer, but none came.
Anyway, she did not protest, and that to some extent
was encouraging.</p>

<p>They had arrived at the Surrey end of the bridge,
and were returning. Quamina was always some eight
or ten yards from them.</p>

<p>The church bells, chiming ten o'clock, came with a
mellow sound. The river traffic was subdued. The
pleasure-boats had practically ceased. They would not
be busy again until close upon midnight. Nyra held
out her hand.</p>

<p><said>Good night,</said> said <choice><corr>she</corr><orig>he</orig></choice> softly.</p>

<p>Ralstone's heart bounded. This surely meant that
she had not bidden him adieu definitely. He took the
soft little hand and, moved by a sudden <choice><corr>impulse</corr><orig>implse</orig></choice>, he
raised it to his lips. He was startled by a harsh sound
from behind, not unlike the growl of a wild beast. Nyra
quickly withdrew her hand.</p>

<p><said>Quamina's angry,</said> she whispered. <said>I've kept him
waiting too long.</said></p>

<p>She turned swiftly. Ralstone did not seek to detain
her, and she walked with rapid footsteps to the negro,
and Ralstone watched them hurrying towards the Strand
end of the bridge. He did not attempt to keep pace
with them—he knew she would not like it. When he
reached the turnstile they had disappeared.</p>

<p>In the Strand, Ralstone jumped into a hackney
coach and bade the driver set him down at White's.
He wanted to see Lord Walsham, and found him where
he expected—in the card-room.</p>

<p><said>When you've finished your game,</said> said he quietly
to his friend, who was playing whist, <said>I'd like to have
a word with you.</said></p>

<p>Walsham nodded and went on dealing. The rubber
<pb n="183"/>
was over in a quarter of an hour or so, and the two went
into the general club-room and sat down in a quiet
corner.</p>

<p><said>Walsham,</said> said he, <said>you must arrange this matter
between Tenbury and myself at once. Go to him and
insist upon his appointing another man in the place of
Lord Houston.</said></p>

<p><said>What's happened to put you in such a devil of a
hurry?</said> asked the young nobleman.</p>

<p><said>Only that I've discovered Sir Phineas to be a greater
blackguard than I took him to be. Don't seek to
inquire any further than this. Please oblige me.</said></p>

<p><said>Certainly, if you insist. At the same time, I'm
bound to tell you that in my opinion he won't fight
until he's discharged his debt of honour.</said></p>

<p><said>To the deuce with his debt and his honour too.
I'm going to fight him. For Heaven's sake don't raise
any objections. I'm not in the mood for quibbling.</said></p>

<p><said>I see you're not. I'll do what you wish. Make
your mind easy. It's too late to begin a wild-goose
chase to-night. I'll call upon Tenbury to-morrow.</said></p>

<p><said>Thanks.</said></p>

<p><said>Are you going in for a flutter? You're generally
lucky at <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="roman">écarté.</foreign></said></p>

<p><said>No. I've other things to think about. Good night
and again thank you.</said></p>

<div n="18" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="18">XVIII</num></head>
<head type="main">Stroke and Counter-Stroke</head>

<p>Lady Barbara, boiling over with wrath, was at the
milliner's shop in Cranbourne Alley at the time she had
fixed, eager to pour out the dregs of her bad temper on
Sir Phineas. Perhaps the baronet anticipated some-
thing of the kind, for he came not, nor did he send an
apology. The lady waited an hour and a half, snubbed
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews unmercifully when the woman attempted
to console her by suggesting excuses for Tenbury, and
went away in a fury.</p>

<pb n="184"/>

<p>The next morning Benham, Tenbury's valet, brought
her a curt note from his master, suggesting the prudence
of meeting at an earlier hour, before <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews put
up her shutters. If Lady Barbara were then seen
entering the shop by any of her friends, it would be
thought that her only business was to make a purchase.</p>

<p>By the time her ladyship read the note she had had
a night's rest and had calmed down. She realised the
policy of discretion, and returned an answer consenting
to the arrangement, and appointing seven o'clock for
the meeting. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews closed her shop at half-
past.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas was still in bed when Lady Barbara's
answer came. Benham brought him his breakfast, and
the baronet, while amusing himself with the meal—
breakfast with him was always a farce—tried to
piece out what the <q>something important</q> which had
so agitated Lady Barbara could be. He gave it up
eventually, for neither of her notes had given him the
slightest clue.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas dallied through his toilet, and, while his
man was shaving him, Vicary was announced.</p>

<p><said>Let him come here,</said> said the baronet.</p>

<p>Something unexpected must have brought the spy,
he thought, and he was eager to learn what had
happened. Directly he caught sight of Vicary's face in
the glass, he knew the matter was serious. The man's
complexion was leaden, his lips were red and disagree-
ably moist, and his eyes, no longer shifty and cunning,
had a vicious look in them, the meaning of which Sir
Phineas, from previous experience, understood perfectly
well. The spy had come to grief, had probably received
bodily chastisement, and had consoled himself with deep
potations of <soCalled>heavy wet.</soCalled> He was beginning to pour
out the story of his woes, but Tenbury checked him.</p>

<p><said>Wait until Benham's finished,</said> said he, harshly.
<said>I'm not going to take the chance of a gash.</said></p>

<p>So Vicary stood, his drooping shoulders more con-
spicuous than ever, his eyes scowling and he twisting
his hat in his not over-clean hands.</p>

<p><said>Now, then, what is it?</said> said Sir Phineas, rising from
<pb n="185"/>
his chair after Benham had powdered his face and oiled
and brushed his hair, his moustachios and his whiskers.</p>

<p><said>This job's done with, Sir Phineas,</said> the fellow burst
out. <said>I'm not going to keep watch on that young tiger
again. Get some one else, sir. He spotted me last
night in Covent Garden. He nearly choked me, and
pretty near shook the breath out of my body. He dug
his knuckles in my throat and I can hardly speak, and
he finished by rolling me in a mud-heap. I was to tell
you to do your spy work yourself, and he threatened, if
he found me watching him again, to half kill me.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas shrugged his shoulders and appeared to
regard Vicary's troubles with stony indifference. As a
matter of fact he was secretly much perturbed.</p>

<p><said>Just pull yourself together and go over the whole
story. Don't omit the smallest trifle,</said> said he, coldly.</p>

<p>Vicary obeyed; the baronet listened thoughtfully.</p>

<p><said>Why the devil didn't you disguise yourself better?</said>
was his comment, when the man had no more to say.
<said>You did your work clumsily. Where did Ralstone
go after he'd done with you?</said></p>

<p><said>How do I know, sir? I couldn't follow him,
covered as I was with mud from head to foot, and
bruised and mauled so terribly. You'll have to get
somebody else.</said></p>

<p><said>You're a fool. I take it a little golden ointment
will cure your hurt.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas dived his hand into his pocket and pulled
out five guineas.</p>

<p>The man took the coins, but expressed no thanks.</p>

<p><said>What's Mr Ralstone been doing since the rumpus?</said></p>

<p><said>Staying in bed mostly, so I got out of one of the
scullery-maids at the <q>Tavistock.</q> If the way he
tumbled me's anything to go by, he don't seem much
the worse.</said></p>

<p><said>I thought you were a dabster at the spy game. You
don't seem to have learned much when you were an
<q>informer,</q></said> said Sir Phineas sarcastically.</p>

<p><said>That's a gentlemanly occupation, sir, compared to
this,</said> retorted the fellow sullenly.</p>

<p><said>You mean it's safer. Do you tell me you can't
<pb n="186"/>
tog yourself out so that you wouldn't be recognised?</said></p>

<p><said>I don't know, sir. All I can say is that the young
bruiser remembered having seen me at <q>The George,</q>
Andover.</said></p>

<p><said>The devil he did. I'll swear it was due more to
your stupidity than to his sharpness. Tell me, were
you ass enough to let out that I was employing you?</said></p>

<p><said>No, sir. He guessed it, though.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas stroked his moustache thoughtfully. It
was of supreme importance that Ralstone should be
watched, for he could not get it out of his head that his
rival knew where Nyra was, but how could he get
another spy at a moment's notice? A woman would
serve his purpose better than a man. If he could but
lay his hands on old Sally Winch, who had been so
valuable to him over Nyra's abduction, she would play
the part admirably. Where was she to be found?
The last he had heard of her was that she and her son
Jerry had been running a boxing booth at Stepney Fair,
and varying this business with tricking the public at
swindling games. They would most likely be spending
their ill-gotten gains at a <q>boozing ken</q> in Wapping,
the situation of which was known to him.</p>

<p><said>See here, Vicary,</said> said he, after a long pause.
<said>Find your way to a fresh disguise—a patch over your
eye, a bandage round your head, and a twist of your
body as though you were a cripple, to hide your con-
foundedly ugly shoulders, ought to do the trick. It's
your shoulders that give you away. Dress as a beggar
and stick on the kerb. It'll be only for a day or two.
After that I mayn't want you.</said></p>

<p>Vicary evidently didn't relish the proposition. He
had a wholesome dread of Ralstone, but finally he
consented and shuffled away.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas had not got over the disquietude arising
out of Vicary's mishap when a visitor called, the
announcement of whose name sent a black frown
stealing over his face. The visitor was Lord Walsham.
Tenbury had no close acquaintance with Walsham, and
there could be only one business which could bring him.
He had come on behalf of Jack Ralstone.</p>

<pb n="187"/>

<p><said>Devil take the fellow,</said> he muttered. <said>I verily
believe he was born to plague me. The sooner he's out
of the world the better.</said></p>

<p>But when Lord Walsham was shown into the room,
Sir Phineas was as smooth and as smiling as ever. He
bowed and pointed to a chair.</p>

<p><said>Thanks. It's hardly worth while sitting down,</said>
rejoined the young nobleman politely. <said>My errand
won't take more than a couple of minutes. I'm sure
you'll agree with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone that the little affair
between him and you has been hanging about too long.
The fault isn't his. Lord Houston, who was to act for
you, has not returned from Paris, and no other second
has been mentioned. As you've been silent on the
matter, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone has requested me to ask you to
name a substitute.</said></p>

<p><said>I can do that at once. Captain Frederick Charteris
will be happy to serve me. You will find him at the
Guards' Club,</said> rejoined Sir Phineas stiffly.</p>

<p><said>I am infinitely obliged. I presume that, like my
principal, you don't wish for further delay?</said></p>

<p><said>The sooner the better, sir.</said></p>

<p><said>I thank you, Sir Phineas. It saves much trouble
when the two principals are agreed on so important a
point. I have the honour to wish you good day.</said></p>

<p><said>Good day to your lordship.</said></p>

<p>Tenbury's manner was offensive. As he bowed,
Lord Walsham murmured to himself, <said>Distinctly
hoggish. If Ralstone were not going to fight him, I
should feel inclined to call him out myself.</said></p>

<p>The fact was Sir Phineas found it hard work to
control his temper. His bile, already stirred up by
Vicary's failure, was now bubbling over. Ralstone had
scored by taking the first step to bring matters to a con-
clusion, and this had sent him into a tempest of passion,
which burst out in full fury after Lord Walsham was
gone. The truth was, he did want the duel post-
poned. It was a paradoxical position, for the man
whom he would like to hurry out of the world was just
then indispensable, if his crafty plans were to succeed.
Only through Ralstone did he hope to discover where
<pb n=""/>
Nyra was hiding, while upon Ralstone's marriage with
Lady Barbara Dacre depended his getting free from
an entanglement with a passionate, self-willed woman,
who was entirely governed by emotions which she was
utterly unable to control.</p>

<p>And deep down in his mind was a temptation which he
hardly dared formulate into a definite thought. But it
existed all the same, and its possibilities continually
haunted him step by step. Ralstone wedded to Lady
Barbara—Simon Halstead's reconciliation with his step-
son—Lady Barbara a rich woman—her husband killed
in a duel—Lady Barbara Ralstone a widow—her
marriage with himself, Sir Phineas Tenbury. How easy
it all was! How admirably everything dovetailed with
each other! But to carry it out, the duel <emph>must</emph> be
delayed. The non-payment of his debt of honour was
a valid reason why it should be. Men who understood
such things would applaud rather than condemn him.</p>

<p>In the midst of his ponderings, to which successive
nips of brandy contributed, another visitor was an-
nounced—his friend Captain Frederick Charteris, a
grey-headed man, stiff and formal in manner.</p>

<p><said>Lord Walsham has just called on me,</said> said the
grizzled soldier, <said>so I thought I'd better see you at
once. Of course, I'll do all that's needful, but rather
a curious point has cropped up, which rests with you to
settle. Walsham tells me you owe his man £4,000.
Now it appears that this is a bet, and while it's owing
you can't possibly meet Ralstone.</said></p>

<p><said>So I once thought. The damned thing's worried
me more than enough, but what the deuce can I do?
I've exhausted the whole tribe of Judah. They won't
lend me a shilling. Does it matter very much?</said></p>

<p><said>It matters very much to <emph>me</emph>, Tenbury.</said></p>

<p>Charteris was a martinet in everything he did, and
his notions of what constituted gentlemanly conduct
were very strict. Straight as a die himself, he had a
horror of being mixed up in anything that might be
considered at all questionable.</p>

<p><said>I don't see why. Walsham had no business to
<pb n="189"/>
drag in the bet; my quarrel with Ralstone has nothing
to do with money.</said></p>

<p><said>That may be, and if it were simply a quarrel we're
talking about, it wouldn't matter a jot. But I'm not
concerned with your quarrel. It's a duel that's <emph>my</emph>
business—a very different thing. If you go on your
usual line of fighting, you're out to wing your man,
maybe fatally. If so, and you haven't squared up, it'll
be said you killed him to avoid payment. You'll be
struck off every club you belong to. Damn it, man,
you'll practically be cashiered and ruined.</said></p>

<p>The honest and punctilious Captain hadn't the
slightest idea that he was playing into Tenbury's hands.
Sir Phineas had no intention of letting Charteris know
of his desire for delay. It suited him admirably that
the argument should come from his second. The good
faith of the old soldier would not be questioned.</p>

<p><said>You hold, then, that the debt must be discharged
before I meet Ralstone?</said> said he, after a long minute
of silence, during which he appeared to be turning the
matter over in his mind, whereas it was but a piece of
acting.</p>

<p><said>Unquestionably, as a man of <emph>honour</emph> you've no other
course.</said></p>

<p><said>Perhaps you're right. Of course, I'd like to plank
the money down, but—how long would you consider a
reasonable time?</said></p>

<p><said>How the deuce can one answer such a question? If
it's known you're straining every nerve to raise the
needful, Ralstone can't throw a stone at you. I've
already hinted as much to Lord Walsham, and if you
think as I do, I shall write to him to that effect. He'll
see the reasonableness of the thing.</said></p>

<p><said>Very well. I'm in your hands,</said> rejoined Tenbury,
with a well-assumed air of resignation.</p>

<p>Captain Charteris expressed his satisfaction and
went off with zest to further the negotiations. It was
a task after his own heart.</p>

<head type="main">The Tragedy of Lady Barbara</head>

<p>Tenbury's anxiety was not removed. The success of
his crafty plotting depended upon Lady Barbara. He
was now impatient to see her—to hear whether she had
used her fascinations properly and had won over
Ralstone. At times terrible doubts seized him. He
was, as a rule, a heavy feeder, but to-day he could
hardly eat anything. He could only drink. To drive
away his thoughts he passed the afternoon at a cock-
fight, won a trifle, had a quarrel with another man,
and when the time came for his appointment at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Matthews he was <q>jumpy</q> and in a mood when any-
thing might send him in a fury.</p>

<p>He was so eager to see Lady Barbara that—a most
unusual thing for him—he reached the shop a minute
or so before the time. Lady Barbara had not come.
This irritated him. A second affront was that the room
on the first floor, which was usually the meeting place,
was not available.</p>

<p><said>My own room behind the shop is quite as good,</said>
said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews apologetically. <said>Had you come
last night you could have had the other.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas cursed and swore at the dumpy woman,
with hair the colour of bathbrick, small, washed-out-
looking pale blue eyes, and two prominent rabbit-like
upper teeth, who only smiled deprecatingly. She knew
Tenbury's humour well.</p>

<p><said>We might as well be talking in the street,</said> he
stormed. <said>The customers in your shop can hear every-
thing.</said></p>

<p><said>Indeed they can't, Sir Phineas. Look at the double
doors. Both covered with green baize, and quite a
deep space between. I had them made on purpose.
The wall's thick enough, in all conscience.</said></p>

<p>The lady volunteered to go into the room and sing
out her loudest as proof of her assertion, but Sir Phineas
rejected her offer contemptuously and strode into the
<pb n="191"/>
apartment. It was shabbily furnished and had more
the appearance of a workshop than a living-room. The
bench beneath the window was strewn with millinery
materials and bonnets in every stage of preparation.
Here <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews stowed away her 'prentice girls,
most of them taken from the workhouse of St. Martin's-
in-the-Fields, and, it was said, treated them after the
fashion of a slave-driver. No doubt she found the
double doors useful. People passing along Cranbourne
Alley could not hear their screams. She was a veritable
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Brownrigg.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas paced the squalid chamber in a quiver
of nerves. The close foul air, the dismal light of the
smoky lamp offended the fine gentleman within. What
a miserable meeting-place for a baronet and a duke's
daughter! But there would be no love-making; of
that he was sure.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. The opening of the door
and the sudden appearance of the lady almost startled
him, for not a sound had come from the shop. So far
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews had spoken the truth.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara was closely veiled and very quietly
dressed. But beneath her cloak when she threw it
open—it was a hot evening and she had walked from
Berkeley Square rather than run the risk of being
recognised by a hackney coachman—a string of pearls
was encircling her round neck, and a brooch of emeralds
and diamonds was struck in the bosom of her dress.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas did not advance to meet her, and she
came towards him, looking very lovely in her agitation.
Like Sir Phineas, she had all day been in a state of
nervous excitement.</p>

<p><said>Well,</said> said the Baronet abruptly when she was close
to him, <said>what luck? Have you brought him to his
knees?</said></p>

<p><said>No.</said></p>

<p><said>How, then?</said></p>

<p>His voice was trembling with suppressed anger. Lady
Barbara's, on the contrary, was quite calm, but it was
the calm preceding a storm,</p>

<pb n="192"/>

<p><said>I could do nothing with the fool. He bluntly refused
to renew our engagement.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas stared blankly at her as though he had
imperfectly grasped the meaning of her words.</p>

<p><said>Do you really ask me to believe that you, with all
your beauty—with all the arts you women can use
when you're so minded—with that flash of your rolling
eyes—with those lips which can be so beseeching—
haven't I seen them?—you failed to move him?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes.</said></p>

<p><said>Did you point out that he hasn't a penny to call
his own, and that he'd be a rich man if he married
you?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, he knows it all. But of what use are arguments
against love? What matters a woman's beauty if the
man is steeled against it by his love for another?
Phineas, Ralstone has found the woman he loves, and
<emph>you</emph> know it as well as I do—perhaps better.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara's calmness has vanished. The glitter
in her eyes was startling. Rich colour dyed her cheeks,
even to her ears. The lips which Sir Phineas had found
so beseeching were defiant. For a moment Tenbury
was staggered, partly because of the unexpected in-
tensity of her passion, and partly because her words
confirmed his worst fears concerning Ralstone and
Nyra.</p>

<p><said>You say nothing. Then it's true,</said> she cried. <said>Who's
the woman?</said></p>

<p><said>I don't understand what you're talking about. Ral-
stone lied if he told you I knew the woman he's put in
your place.</said></p>

<p><said>He didn't. I guess it. Why are you fighting?
He admitted that it was over a woman. Men don't do
that unless they both love her. Who is she?</said></p>

<p><said>Again I say he lied.</said></p>

<p><said>What are you fighting about?</said> she reiterated.</p>

<p><said>An old quarrel. We fell out at Andover over the
prize-fight.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't believe you. Tell me the story.</said></p>

<p>Sir Phineas mumbled something, but it was not very
coherent, and Lady Barbara listened to him impatiently.</p>

<pb n="193"/>

<p><said>'Tis you who's the liar. Why did you send me to
Jack Ralstone, to be humiliated? He as good as in-
sulted me, but you're a thousand times worse. What
are you going to do?</said></p>

<p><said>What can I do? Nothing. I don't see why you
should fly into a rage. You failed. Well, I'm sorry
you're done out of your promised dowry. I thought
you were more fascinating than it appears you are—
that's all.</said></p>

<p>The slighting words fanned the fire of her fury. She
could contain herself no longer. She swiftly raised her
hand and struck him on the cheek with all her strength.
It was a woman's blow, but no light one, coming from
a Somersetshire girl full of youth and vigour. He
threw back his head and involuntarily clenched his
fists. Murder was written in his eyes, but she faced him
undauntedly.</p>

<p>His glance fell beneath hers. He hardly knew what
to say. He wanted time to think, and that he had
much to think about was certain, for the whole edifice
he had plotted so carefully to build was toppling over.</p>

<p>Hatred of Jack Ralstone was seething in his brain.
There was no necessity for deferring the duel. He wished
it could have been brought off that minute. But his
bet was still the stumbling block. Lady Barbara was
a negligible quantity. All the same, there she was, and
something would have to be done with her. Squabbling
and mutual recriminations would lead to nothing.</p>

<p><said>Your ladyship has a strong hand. I presume your
maids give you plenty of exercise that way. Suppose we
sit down and talk quietly over this wretched business,</said>
said he, trying hard to keep his voice steady.</p>

<p><said>Talk quietly? What's the use of that? We've
talked too much already. Do you think it's any pleasure
for me to listen to your falsehoods? Tell me the name
of the woman you and Ralstone are going to fight for.</said></p>

<p>She was raging up and down the room. It seemed
useless to say anything while she was no longer mistress
of herself. He threw himself sullenly in a chair and
watched her. Had he not been so personally concerned
and in such a quandary, he would have enjoyed the
<pb n="194"/>
sight. The sudden lifting of her arm when striking
him had displaced the upper part of her dress. The
short sleeve had shifted from the right shoulder, and
the pearls showed prominently on the satin background
of her white skin. They shimmered at every movement
of her supple body, which swayed under the influence
of her mad fury. It was a magnificent picture of glow-
ing womanhood, and one of which she was wholly un-
conscious.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances Sir Phineas would have
had no eyes but for her beauty and her form, but now
his attention was fixed on the pearls. The sight flashed
an idea through his mind. He knew their value. The
duke had given ten thousand pounds for them as a gift
to his wife on their wedding day.</p>

<p><said>I could borrow five thousand pounds on those pearls
easy. I wonder if it's possible to talk Barbara into
lending them to me? If not—damn it, I <emph>must</emph> have
them.</said></p>

<p>His blood had been stirred by the brutal cock-fighting
match he had witnessed that afternoon. It had set his
brain on fire, and the lust of combat, of savagery, of
victory lingered. His animal instinct for mastery had
been roused, and all that had happened since had but
accentuated it. He longed to see Ralstone prostrate
at his feet, whether by bullet or sword did not matter
much. It could be done. The way was in sight if
Barbara &#x2026;</p>

<p>A significant sound broke into his reverie. Lady
Barbara had sunk upon the couch; her face was buried
in her hands; she was sobbing bitterly. The tears
which would not come at her bidding when she was
with Jack Ralstone were streaming freely enough now.
The inevitable result of over-excitement had come.</p>

<p>A grim smile flitted across Tenbury's hard face when
he saw this sign of softening. If he insisted, the pearls
were as good as his. He had no compunction as to the
morality of what he contemplated. He had for years
lived on women. If he could not coax them into helping
him, he took what he wanted by force. But he preferred
the first method.</p>

<pb n="195"/>

<p>He allowed her ladyship to have her cry out, and
waited patiently for her to raise her tear-stained face.
But she was thoroughly exhausted, and though her
audible sobs had ceased, it was evident by the heaving
of her shoulders and the throbbing of her body that she
was repressing them by strength of will.</p>

<p>At last Sir Phineas could endure the spectacle no
longer. To his mind it was ridiculous—almost as
ridiculous as her jealousy of an unknown woman, for, of
course, jealousy was at the bottom of the exhibition.</p>

<p><said>Isn't it time this tragic farce of yours was over,
Lady Barbara?</said> he inquired sarcastically. <said>Perhaps
you'll listen now that you're coming to your senses. I
didn't think it necessary to go into the details of the
quarrel between me and Ralstone, but if you must
know, it concerned a little French woman, who keeps
a perfume and fal-lal shop in Burlington Arcade. It
doesn't affect you in the slightest, nor, in fact, does it
me. About Ralstone I won't say. Madame seems un-
warrantably to have said something concerning myself
to him. We had a few words—of course your name
came up, and the way I cut him out at Bath, which he
seems to have taken much to heart—and there was no
alternative but to fight it out. There you have the
whole thing in a nutshell.</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara slowly lifted her head. Every vestige
of colour had vanished from her face save a bright patch
of scarlet in the centre of each cheek. Despite the
heat of the room, she was shivering.</p>

<p><said>Your story is interesting, and might go down if
Jack Ralstone had not assured me that <emph>I</emph> was not the
cause of the quarrel. It was that which opened my
eyes.</said></p>

<p><said>Exactly. And what Ralstone told you corroborates
my words.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't care whether it does or doesn't. I've had
enough of this very unpleasant subject, and I don't want
to hear any more about it. Nor do I wish to see you
again.</said></p>

<p>She struggled to her feet and began arranging her
dress and bonnet in front of a mirror. Sir Phineas saw
<pb n="196"/>
that he must bring matters to an issue or his chance
would be gone.</p>

<p>He stole behind her, and his arm went round her
waist. At his touch she shrank from him.</p>

<p><said>You're making a mountain out of a molehill, my
darling Barbara,</said> said he softly. <said>You talk about
not seeing me again, but that's nonsense. You can't
do without me. You're still in a fix over your debts.
I've got you out of one difficulty; I've satisfied the
harpy in the shop, but what about the others? How
are you going to get credit to enable you to dress as a
woman of your rank and fashion ought?</said></p>

<p>Lady Barbara winced. He had reminded her of the
skeleton which was continually coming out of its cup-
board and frightening her. Already she had received
rebuffs. Her mercer, her draper, her dressmaker insisted
upon ready money.</p>

<p><said>I wonder you haven't thought of the way out that's
before your eyes,</said> he went on.</p>

<p><said>Before my eyes? You're talking nonsense.</said></p>

<p><said>What about those beautiful pearls? I can raise
money on them enough to pay what you owe twice
over.</said></p>

<p><said>Part with my pearls? Never!</said></p>

<p><said>It's not parting with them. It's just depositing
them for a short time with a jeweller. You've only to
repay the borrowed money and they're yours again.</said></p>

<p><said>No. I refuse. The pearls were my mother's; they
shall not go out of my keeping.</said></p>

<p>All the brutality in Tenbury's nature—and he had
plenty of it—leaped up. Hatred of Ralstone was still
in his mind. Once his rival was out of the way nothing
stood between him and Nyra. That he would succeed
in tracing her he was certain. That four thousand
pounds he must have. He would behave fair to Lady
Barbara. He would give her one thousand out of the
five thousand pounds he hoped to raise. This would
reconcile her to the temporary loss of the pearls.</p>

<p><said>I'm going to have them. Do you hear? Take
them off.</said></p>

<p>His face was distorted—fiendish. He thrust out his
<pb n="197"/>
hand. She wheeled swiftly round to avoid him, caught
her foot in some waste material, shreds of silk, lining,
wire and what not, cast on the ground after the fashion
of milliners, and pitched forward. A ghastly sound,
as her head struck the sharp steel fender, sent the blood
rushing from Tenbury's face. Horror-stricken, he glared
at the prostrate, motionless body for a second or two,
and tremblingly bent over her. The fender had in-
flicted a frightful wound. Already the grey shadow of
death was passing over her face. He felt her wrist. He
could not distinguish a single pulse-beat.</p>

<p>There came an agitated rapping at the door. Despite
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews's elaborate precautions for the deadening
of sound, she must have heard the crash, for in her fall
Barbara had sent the fire-irons jingling.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas had but a few seconds in which to provide
for a dozen vital contingencies. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews could
not be kept waiting, or her suspicions would be aroused.
He had to be ready with some plausible story as to how
the accident had happened. There was the necklace.
Should he yield to the temptation of taking it? If he
did, would it be missed? Could Barbara's maid say
if her mistress was wearing it when she went out? The
probabilities were in favour of the maid's ignorance.
Lady Barbara was on an errand which demanded the
utmost secrecy. She had dressed herself in plain, sober
garments and would not need the girl's services.</p>

<p>But he could not debate the point. The rapping, after
ceasing for a while, had recommenced. He made a dash
for the clasp, unfastened it, and dragged the pearls,
their lustre dimmed with red, from the fair neck. The
next moment they were in his pocket, and then he rushed
to the door and shot back the bolt.</p>

<p><said>Good lawk, Sir Phineas, what's amiss?</said> whispered
the woman, shaking from head to foot. Then she
caught sight of Lady Barbara and the blood which was
slowly trickling down the fender on to the hearthrug,
and she gave a scream.</p>

<p><said>Oh, sir. What have you done?</said></p>

<p><said>Done?</said> echoed Sir Phineas harshly. <said>Nothing. It
was an accident. Lady Barbara tripped over some
<pb n="198"/>
rubbish on the floor and fell. The wire's twisted round
her ankle. Can't you see? It's all the fault of your
careless girls.</said></p>

<p><said>I'd better fetch a doctor,</said> gasped <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews in
a hushed voice.</p>

<p><said>I'm afraid he can't do anything. I believe the poor
lady's dead.</said></p>

<p><said>Dead! Oh, my God!</said></p>

<p><said>What's done is done. A doctor must see her, of
course, but you've got to think of yourself first. Do as
I tell you. I mustn't be known in the matter. The
most important thing is Lady Barbara's reputation.
No one must know that she was here to meet me. It
was an accident. Keep that fixed in your mind. She
came into this room to try on a bonnet, or whatever
you please—I leave that to you—and her foot slipped.
Your shop isn't shut, and there was nobody in it besides
yourself, so the tale will hang together. Recollect, if
there's any inquiry, you'll cone out of it rather badly.
1 shall contradict you flatly if you drag me into the
business, and my word will be taken against yours. I
fancy you know what the inside of Newgate's like. On
the other hand, carry out my instructions, be discreet
and wary, and I'll make it worth your while. Here's
something to go on with.</said></p>

<p>He had his gains at the cockpit on him, and he counted
out ten guineas and dropped them into the woman's
shaking hand.</p>

<p><said>It's simple enough,</said> he went on rapidly. <said>Wait
a couple of minutes after I'm gone, and then you can
send for a doctor. Have you got the story pat?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh. I—I think so, Sir Phineas,</said> stammered the
woman.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas looked at her keenly. He knew she was
as shrewd and crafty as a woman who engaged in so
doubtful an occupation need be. He was satisfied and
he strode away.</p>

<head type="main">The Trysting-Place on the Bridge</head>

<p><said>Who on earth would have supposed the fellow would
have had such a nice sense of what he calls honour?
The debt ought not to stand in the way. Though I'm
hard up, as you know, Walsham, I don't care a curse
about the money. I want to get even with the
scoundrel.</said></p>

<p><said>Of course. Charteris tells me that his man is as
eager to fight as you are. It's Charteris himself who's
the obstacle. There's a lot of the pipeclay and the
drill-sergeant's stick about the captain. He's as firm
as a rock on the point that while bets between principals
exist there ought to be no fight. I'm inclined to agree
with him, but to oblige you I was willing to give way,
but Charteris won't hear of it. However, you mayn't
have to wait long.</said></p>

<p><said>What makes you think that?</said> demanded Ralstone
gloomily. <said>There's not a money-lender in London
who'll advance Tenbury a shilling.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm aware of that. I made it my business to call
on Charteris this morning to discuss the matter again,
and he told me he'd had a letter late last night from
Sir Phineas to the effect that he was certain to be able
to borrow the money from Lord Houston. Houston
came into a fortune some three months ago, and he's
flinging his gold about like water.</said></p>

<p><said>At the best it means a delay of at least a fortnight.</said></p>

<p><said>Probably; but that's all in your favour. A few
days' more practice at the foils and pistols won't hurt
you.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm not so sure. There's such a thing as getting
stale. Excepting the few days after the Thurtell bat-
tering, I've been doing nothing but hard work at both
at Castellani's. Castellani was good enough to tell
me this week that he considered I was at the top of
my form. I succeeded in breaking through his guard
<pb n="200"/>
yesterday, and I snuffed the candle nine times out of
ten at fifteen paces.</said></p>

<p><said>I congratulate you. My advice is to take it easy
for a week or so.</said></p>

<p>The two men were at White's. At that moment a
member bustled in with the <title>Globe and Traveller</title> in his
hand. His face was serious, his manner full of im-
portance.</p>

<p><said>A most frightful thing has happened,</said> said he,
approaching the friends and breaking into their con-
versation without ceremony. <said>The <title>Globe</title> says that
Lady Barbara Dacre met with a fatal accident last
night. She's dead.</said></p>

<p><said>Great Heaven!</said> cried Ralstone, terribly shocked
and with genuine emotion in his voice. He could say
no more. He was stunned. The news was incredible.
It was Lord Walsham who asked how the catastrophe
had come about.</p>

<p>The journals of a century ago did not understand the
art of sensational newsmongering. They were con-
tented to record bare facts expressed tersely. Space
was limited. All that could be learned from the <title>Globe</title>
was that Lady Barbara Dacre was trying on a bonnet
in the inner room of a milliner's shop in Cranbourne
Alley when, in turning round, her foot became entangled
in some wire and waste stuff on the floor and she fell,
striking her head on the fender and receiving so severe
a wound that she was dead before a doctor could be
summoned. <q>Great sympathy,</q> the paragraph went on,
<q>has been expressed with his Grace the Duke of End-
sleigh and the callers at his mansion in Berkeley Square
this morning were very numerous, but the duke was
too prostrated by grief to see anyone.</q></p>

<p>Lord Walsham uttered a few words of condolence,
but Ralstone hardly heard them.</p>

<p><said>I wish to God we had parted friends,</said> broke out
Jack in choking tones. A lump had risen in his throat
and he grasped the young nobleman's hand held out to
him in kindliness.</p>

<p><said>You've nothing to reproach yourself with, my dear
Ralstone.</said></p>

<pb n="201"/>
<p><said>Perhaps not; but it's an awful thing to think about.
Poor creature. How handsome she was—just at the
beginning of life too! I ought, I suppose, to call upon
the duke. It'll be a terribly painful interview—
especially after my breaking off the engagement. I
can't tell him why. I wouldn't say a word against poor
Lady Barbara for words.</said></p>

<p><said>It's no use trying to see him for a few days. I know
his Grace's peculiar humour. He hates pity. He'll
receive you with cold politeness, hear what you have
to say, express his obligation and that'll be all. I should
write if I were you.</said></p>

<p><said>I hate letters of condolence. They always seem
more or less false. In my case, what can I say that
won't sound hypocritical?</said></p>

<p><said>The less said the better. The duke understands the
rules of etiquette as well as any man in the world. A
respectful formula will suffice. He wouldn't appreciate
expressions of real feeling. More likely than not he'd
despise them.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone felt in his heart that Walsham correctly
gauged the duke's character. But he wanted to do the
right thing and as promptly as possible. For the
moment the tragedy had driven everything out of his
head and he hurried back to the <q>Tavistock</q> to piece
out something appropriate in the quietude of his bed-
room. At last the embarrassing task was accomplished
and he dispatched the note by one of the servants.
Then he sat down to ponder over the matter and to
consider its effect in other directions.</p>

<p>There was Squire Halstead. How would he take it?
Seriously, without a doubt, for he knew little or nothing
of the state of affairs between his stepson and Lady
Barbara, and while she was alive he might have cherished
the hope that matters would yet turn out as he had
planned.</p>

<p>Thoughts of the Squire revived in Ralstone's mind a
recollection of what Bill Neate had said about him—
how his strangeness of manner was causing uneasiness
to his household. Since Ralstone's departure from the
Manor House not the slightest communication had
<pb n="202"/>
passed between him and the old man. Jack had stood
upon his dignity and Simon Halstead's was not the
nature to give way. Indeed, had he been so inclined,
he was not a letter writer and this in itself was a suf-
ficient barrier to a reconciliation.</p>

<p>Now that Jack was free and no longer rankling under
the sense of injustice, he was quite willing to do what he
could to conciliate Simon. He was not actuated in this
feeling by any mercenary motive. Never would he ask
his stepfather for a single penny, no matter what his
difficulties might be. But it was just these scruples
which would prevent him seeking a reconciliation. Old
Simon's nature was suspicious and he would more likely
than not attribute Jack's motive to self-interest and
gain.</p>

<p>Yet Simon had lavished money upon him, and up to
the time of their difference he had never had to ask
twice for any sum that he wanted. He was quite aware
that his silence might be construed as indifference and
ingratitude.</p>

<p><said>Well, I suppose I must risk that. Things'll have to
go on as they are,</said> was the conclusion he came to.</p>

<p>Then gradually his thoughts went back to Nyra—not,
indeed, that they had left her for long. He had
wandered up and down Waterloo Bridge the night be-
fore, but she came not. He proposed doing the same
thing that evening, and he carried out his resolution,
but with no success.</p>

<p>One thing, however, he had to congratulate himself
upon. He saw no more of the spy. He attributed the
reason to the absence of Sir Phineas Tenbury. While
he was away the operation of watching no doubt had
been suspended.</p>

<p>Two days went over, during which he struggled
against an intolerable restlessness. His fencing and his
pistol practice gave him no satisfaction. He never
handled the foils worse nor missed the candles so many
times. His instructor could not understand what had
come to him. On the third day he received a polite and
formal acknowledgment of his letter from the Duke of
Endsleigh, and on the fourth came a brief account of
<pb n="203"/>
the inquest on Lady Barbara. <q>Death by misadventure</q>
was the verdict, and the nine days' wonder in the
fashionable world was over.</p>

<p>And all this time he had heard nothing, nor had he
seen anything of Nyra. He was beginning to worry
intensely. Should he call on <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover and settle his
doubts? He could not bring his mind to this—at least,
not until he had tried Waterloo Bridge once more.</p>

<p>It was very dark, totally unlike that lovely night
when he last met Nyra, full of romance as it was, with
the opalescent sky above and the rushing of the flood
tide below. The air was close, almost suffocating. The
low rumble of distant thunder came now and again.
The river was invisible—nothing but a huge black gap
between the few feebly lighted windows of the waterside
taverns. The bridge lamps cast weird patches of mov-
ing light on the oily stream, now at its ebb, leisurely
crawling down to the sea. Long stretches of mud,
which the afternoon sun had been fermenting, sent up a
foul odour, mingled with the more wholesome smell of
pitch from the coal barges awaiting dawn to be un-
loaded. The silence was broken now and again by a soft
ripple as the currents met against the buttresses of the
arches.</p>

<p><said aloud="false">She said she only came here when it was fine,</said>
thought Ralstone, as he squeezed through the turnstile.
<said aloud="false">I'm doomed to be disappointed—and if I do meet her
that confounded nuisance of a nigger will be hanging
round closer than ever.</said></p>

<p>He strolled onwards. There were fewer people than
on the occasions of his previous visits, and these were
hurrying homewards to escape a possible storm. The
recesses were vacant and he almost laughed at himself
for looking into them. The last thing she would do, he
thought, would be sitting on such a threatening night.</p>

<p>He was wrong. In one of these retreats, just about
the crown of the bridge, he caught sight of a shadowy
figure, its outlines so indistinct they seemed to mingle
with the blackness around. He stopped hesitatingly.
The shadowy figure rose and stood perfectly still. It
was she. He could not see her face, but the gracefulness
<pb n="204"/>
of form, the characteristic carriage of the shoulders, and
the head slightly thrown back, could hardly be mis-
taken. He stepped into the recess and held out his
hand.</p>

<p><said>Nyra,</said> he whispered.</p>

<p><said>You knew me then?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, and you?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I think I could pick you out among a thousand.</said></p>

<p>She spoke with a curious catching of the breath, as
though she had said more than she intended.</p>

<p><said>Do you really mean that?</said> he rejoined quickly;
his heart bounding in response more to what her words
implied than to the words themselves.</p>

<p><said>I told you I should never forget you.</said></p>

<p>There was a sweetness in her soft reproach that made
Ralstone long to take her in his arms and kiss the
beautiful lips that seemed to be awaiting his.</p>

<p>He could see her face now. The murky light from the
lamp on its standard above glanced across it as she
drooped her head under his ardent gaze, but not before
her gleaming eyes for an instant had rested upon him.</p>

<p>It was one of those soul-felt moments when speech
seems an intrusion. They stood silent—absorbed in
each other. Then, as often happens in such an emotional
crisis, when they did speak it was in commonplaces
—the nervous tension seemed to demand some relief.</p>

<p><said>I did not expect to see you to-night,</said> said Ralstone.
<said>I'm afraid we shall have a storm before long.</said></p>

<p><said>Very likely, but I did not think of that when I
started. We're used to terrific thunderstorms in—where
I come from.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes? And where is that?</said> said Ralstone, with
seeming indifference. He did not want to betray the
curiosity which was consuming him. <said>But perhaps I
ought not to ask. It's no concern of mine.</said></p>

<p>Her reply whetted that curiosity still more.</p>

<p><said>It's more your concern than you imagine,</said> said she.
<said>But we needn't talk about that. Have you been
walking on the bridge since we last met?</said></p>

<p><said>Every night. I've gone away feeling the most
dismal of mortals. But now that you're here——</said></p>

<pb n="205"/>

<p>He paused. Her large eyes were again fixed upon
him. Something prevented him finishing the sentence.
But indeed he hardly knew what he intended to say.</p>

<p><said>Where's your faithful watchdog to-night?</said> he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p><said>You mean Quamina?</said></p>

<p>She smiled. It was the first time he had seen a real
smile on her face. It was like the flash of sunshine on
an April day.</p>

<p><said>Of course I do.</said></p>

<p><said>I've done without him. He did not think I was
going out and he went with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover to the theatre.
He walks on the stage as one of a crowd. He will never
leave the house if he imagines I intend to go out. He'll
contrive somehow to follow me.</said></p>

<p><said>But is he so necessary? You've come to-night alone
—why not always?</said></p>

<p><said>Have you forgotten the reason?</said></p>

<p><said>I beg your pardon. Yes. You must be guarded.
But for a short time you're safe. At least I hope so.
The man you dread and the man I hate—Sir Phineas
Tenbury—is in Paris. He has other things to think of
besides yourself.</said></p>

<p><said>Are you sure?</said> she cried anxiously.</p>

<p><said>Yes. I'm bound to know the minute he returns.
It won't be for at least another week.</said></p>

<p><said>You make my heart glad. Oh, if I only had money!</said>
she burst out.</p>

<p><said>That's what I've been wishing for myself for days
past. And what would you do if you had it?</said></p>

<p><said>Return to my own country. I ought not to have
left it, but I had a great purpose which I felt I ought to
fulfil. It was a mistake—at least I think so now—I
didn't think like that then.</said></p>

<p><said>So that purpose, whatever it may be, you haven't
carried out?</said></p>

<p><said>No. I've been weak. I had not the courage. So
many things have happened to shake my resolve. If
I'd not come to England I should have escaped my
frightful experience of the ways of English—gentlemen.</said></p>

<p><said>They're not all such blackguards as Sir Phineas
<pb n="206"/>
Tenbury,</said> Ralstone exclaimed warmly. <said>I've many
good friends—men like myself—ready to make the best
of life and get as much pleasure out of it as they can.
Of course they're not saints and they play the fool
sometimes, but they'd scorn to do a mean or dishonour-
able action. They would never insult a woman. People
shrug their shoulders because the newspapers call us
Corinthians—it was the <q>Tom and Jerry</q> book and play
that started the name—and because we're fond of
using our fists. Perhaps we are, but we fight fair. After
all, the fist comes in handy sometimes, doesn't it?</said></p>

<p>He glanced significantly at Nyra and the warm blood
rushed to her face. The colour made her look indescrib-
ably beautiful.</p>

<p><said>You're quite right. But for you—oh, I tremble to
think what would have become of me.</said></p>

<p><said>Anyway, that's past and gone. It's the money we
must both think about now. What would it cost to
take you back to—what did you say was your country?</said>
he asked cunningly.</p>

<p>She refused to rise to the bait.</p>

<p><said>I paid £50 for myself and Quamina to come to
England.</said></p>

<p><said>Quamina? Do you propose that he should
accompany you?</said></p>

<p><said>I daren't leave him behind.</said></p>

<p><said>Why not? He could earn a good living in England.
He might go in for <q>milling.</q> The blacks are splendid
boxers. If Molyneux had had fair play he would have
beaten Tom Cribb. Think of that! The champion of
England to go down before a negro—though of course
Cribb wasn't champion then. There's Bill Richmond,
another man of colour—he's a good fighter too.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone spoke with enthusiasm, as he always did
when he got upon the subject of <q>milling</q> and the
heroes of the prize ring.</p>

<p><said>I can't go without Quamina,</said> said Nyra firmly.
<said>He mustn't be left here by himself. I've my reasons.</said></p>

<p><said>Your reasons shall be respected. You know Quamina
and I don't, excepting that I'm sure he doesn't like me.
<pb n="207"/>
In spite of that I've but one wish. Can you guess
it?</said></p>

<p><said>Indeed no. How can I? What is your wish?</said></p>

<p><said>That I may be permitted to go with you, Quamina
notwithstanding, wherever it may be.</said></p>

<p><said>You're wishing impossibilities.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't think so. Supposing I came to you with the
money——</said></p>

<p><said>No, no,</said> she interrupted agitatedly. <said>It's not to
be thought of.</said></p>

<p><said>So you say, but I mean to think of it all the
same.</said></p>

<p>They had been so absorbed in each other that they
never heeded the thunder rumble becoming louder and
louder. At that moment a vivid lightning flash flooded
everything with light. It was followed instantly by a
loud crash and then came isolated drops of warm rain
<choice><corr>as</corr><orig>a</orig></choice> large as sixpences.</p>

<p><said>By Jove! We shall be drenched in less than no
time,</said> cried Ralstone. <said>Let's run. We can get a
coach in the Strand, or at least the shelter of a door-
way.</said></p>

</div>

<head type="main">The Call of the Blood</head>

<p>There was certainly no sense in allowing themselves to
be converted into the condition of drowned rats. Nyra
without a word complied and the two set off at a smart
pace. They had a respite from the coming storm in the
cessation of the rain for a few minutes. The big drops
had obligingly served as a warning. But by the time
they had passed through the turnstile into Lancaster
Place the rain was coming down a pelter.</p>

<p>They had no alternative but to make for the nearest
doorway. There was one at hand, narrow but deep,
with an overhanging shelter in front in the old Georgian
fashion. They managed to squeeze in before the rain
descended, as it did with almost tropical violence.</p>

<p>The two had to stand very close together and Ral-
<pb n="208"/>
stone blessed the storm which had brought him such
good luck. The torrential downpour in front shut them
out from the outer world. The sense of isolation with
so charming a companion was a pleasure as novel to
Jack Ralstone as it was unexpected. True, he had
already had an experience of a somewhat similar kind,
but there was a difference. When he rode away with
her arms clinging round him, he had to devote his
attention mainly to his horse, and he had not the
slightest idea he was rescuing so beauteous a maiden.
But the position was now reversed. He had no one to
think of but her, and it was not her arms that were
round his waist but his—at least, one of his—round hers,
on the plea of giving her more room. And she made no
protest! After all, that was the main point. It was a
supreme moment for the exchange of confidence.</p>

<p>After the first crashing thunder peal, those that
followed were of a milder character. The lightning
flashes were not so vivid. The storm was expending its
fury in buckets of rain. The patter on the cobblestones
and the bubbling of the streams that ran from the roof
gutters lent romance and unreality to the scene. The
situation, the surroundings, the memory of what had
gone before, and the vagueness of the future, acted on
their nerves and brought their personalities closer
together.</p>

<p><said>The thunder doesn't frighten you, does it?</said> Ral-
stone asked, his arm increasing its tender pressure as if
to assure her he was acting as her protector.</p>

<p><said>No. I'm used to storms much worse than this.
You in England can't imagine what a Barbados hur-
ricane is like!</said></p>

<p>Barbados! The name was familiar enough to Jack
Ralstone. Was it not here that his stepfather had his
plantations, and where he had made his money? But
he held his tongue. As he hoped and expected, she
continued:</p>

<p><said>But when it's over and the wind dies down, and the
rain ceases, the blue sky and the glorious sunshine make
one forget everything.</said></p>

<pb n="209"/>
<p><said>You were happy, then, in the land where you were
born?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes and no. How can one be happy where there is
little else but cruelty and slavery—where the rich white
man grinds down the black, where there's no freedom,
no justice?</said></p>

<p>The soft note in her voice was gone. She spoke in
accents strangely harsh and guttural. Ralstone was
disagreeably reminded of certain tones in Quamina's
voice—tones which became very pronounced during
their altercation on the bridge. He glanced at her face.
Excitement possessed her. Her eyes, no longer liquid,
were fierce with passion. She was wound up apparently
by her recalling memories of some old grievance, and
went on talking more to herself than to Ralstone.
Indeed, she seemed to have forgotten his presence.</p>

<p><said>It was more than the search for justice which
brought me to England. It was revenge. I would
have struck down the brutal tyrant who made my
father's life a misery—who robbed him of his land—
who more than once slashed his cruel whip across the
shoulders of his daughter—a mere child she was—who
killed her mother—who was looked upon with horror by
all who slaved for him to put money in his pocket. It
was he who nearly tortured Quamina to death and
looked on coldly while his drivers did it—white men,
remember!—oh, there was unhappiness enough in the
plantations to make one long for death. What would
<emph>you</emph> have done had you been one of Simon Halstead's
slaves?</said></p>

<p>Simon Halstead! His stepfather! Jack Ralstone
started with horror. All the blood in his veins seemed
to rush to his heart and left the surface of his body cold.
He was beginning to read the riddle of Nyra Seaton—
to comprehend faintly why she ran from him at Bath,
thinking he was of the blood of the man she loathed,
whose death, maybe, she sought.</p>

<p><said>I'm glad you've told me about Simon,</said> said Ral-
stone slowly. <said>I understand now why you've been so
reluctant to talk about yourself, but you need not have
been. I've had a bitter quarrel with the old man. I
<pb n="210"/>
shall probably never see him again, and after what
you've said it would certainly be better not. I should
have to speak my mind and pretty plainly. But for the
present I've nothing to do with him. I'm only concerned
with you.</said></p>

<p><said>But that's what you mustn't be,</said> she rejoined, much
calmer in manner, as though unburdening herself to
him was a great relief.</p>

<p><said>What about your going back to Barbados? Mayn't
I help you in that? If I can read what's in your mind,
you've given up <choice><corr>your</corr><orig>you</orig></choice> idea of revenge.</said></p>

<p>She did not reply. The fire had gone from her eyes.
They had become unfathomable—mystic. Her features
had resumed that immobility which he had come to
know so well, and which had always puzzled and
tormented him.</p>

<p><said>I think I could raise the money you want, but if
you go, what's to become of me?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, you can easily console yourself. England is full
of beautiful women. I've seen many.</said></p>

<p><said>There's only one like you, Nyra, and that's yourself.
I love you. I can't—I won't—live without you.</said></p>

<p>She sighed deeply.</p>

<p><said>You must try,</said> said she.</p>

<p><said>Is that what you intend to do?</said></p>

<p>Another sigh.</p>

<p><said>Yes.</said> But it was breathed so faintly he only just
caught the word.</p>

<p><said>Well, I don't. Why shouldn't I go with you? By
Heaven, if it were to the end of the world—to Hades
itself—I wouldn't care a jot so long as you were by my
side. What is there to keep me in England?</said></p>

<p><said>You have a woman you love.</said></p>

<p><said>Only you, Nyra.</said></p>

<p><said>Not the Lady Barbara Dacre?</said></p>

<p><said>What do you know about Lady Barbara?</said></p>

<p><said>Only that you are betrothed to her. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover
told me when I explained to her who you were.</said></p>

<p><said>And did <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Glover tell you that I did <emph>not</emph> love her,
that she did not love me, and because I refused to
<pb n="211"/>
marry her I quarrelled with Simon Halstead and left
him?</said></p>

<p><said>Is that true?</said></p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed penetratingly upon his. He met
her gaze frankly, undauntedly.</p>

<p><said>As true as that you're the only woman in the world
I love and ever shall love. But I haven't told you all
about Lady Barbara. The end of the story is tragic.
Poor Lady Barbara is dead.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh!</said></p>

<p>The exclamation and the tone in which it was uttered
were capable of more than one meaning, but she did
not give him time to think.</p>

<p><said>I didn't know. How could I? I'm sorry. For
you—I mean. Tell me more,</said> she went on a little in-
coherently.</p>

<p>Ralstone could only relate what he had gleaned from
the newspapers. She listened intently.</p>

<p><said>Lady Barbara is but a memory of sadness,</said> said
he when he had finished. <said>We need now only talk of
ourselves.</said></p>

<p>The storm was passing. The black clouds had
vanished and the darkness was not so profound. The
downpour had become a gentle rain which hardly made
any noise. Now and again came a glimpse of moon-
light, and he could see her face. The lines had relaxed.
The lips were no longer tightly drawn. The eyes were
tender, sympathetic. The impenetrable mask of com-
posure was gone. But she remained silent.</p>

<p><said>Everything concerning you, Nyra, interests me,</said> he
continued insistently. <said>I said I loved you. I repeat it.
I've had no reply.</said></p>

<p><said>What am I to say?</said> she asked helplessly.</p>

<p><said>Why, that you love me, of course. Isn't it so?</said></p>

<p>They were face to face. All at once her self-control
fled. She involuntarily drew closer to him. She seemed
to be imploring him to be kind to her. In an instant
the barriers of sex were broken, his arms were enfolding
her, he was kissing her ardently, and she had responded.</p>

<p><said>Oh, you're taking my breath away,</said> he heard her
murmur. <said>You mustn't.</said></p>

<pb n="212"/>

<p>But her sweet protest was only provocative.</p>

<p><said>I shall kiss you until you say <q>I love you,</q></said> he
whispered.</p>

<p><said>Oh I do love you. Heaven forgive me. It's wrong
—it's wicked. But I cannot help it.</said></p>

<p><said>Wicked? Why? What is there wicked in love?
Isn't it the only thing in the world worth living for?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, but——</said></p>

<p><said>There mustn't be any <q>buts.</q> I've often dreamed
of a moment like this, little sweetheart. I never thought
my dream would come true, but now that it has I want
to make it a reality.</said></p>

<p>They relapsed into the babble of love, which is pretty
much in spirit the same with all young lovers, rich or
poor, educated or illiterate.</p>

<p><said>I'd like to confess something to you,</said> said she
presently. <said>You must have all my secrets. You
wanted to know why I think it's wicked for me to love
you. There's a difference between us. You're white,
I'm not. I've black blood in my veins.</said></p>

<p><said>What of that?</said> he broke in impetuously. <said>It makes
you more enchanting.</said></p>

<p><said>They don't think so in Barbados. Black blood
bears the taint of slavery, of inferiority.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, we're not in Barbados, so that goes for no-
thing.</said></p>

<p><said>You forget. I'm returning there. Yet I have in
me but a trace of my African forefathers. My father is
white, my mother had a Spanish father, but his wife
was a pure black. Her descent is enough to make me
despised by the pure white people in the Island. It's
useless to complain. It is so.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't care a button for all the white people in the
world. I love you.</said></p>

<p>She looked at him, her eyes wide with wonderment.</p>

<p><said>You can't imagine what your words mean to me,</said>
she whispered, with a throb of joy in her voice.</p>

<p><said>I'm glad I altered my mind about Simon Halstead,</said>
she went on after a pause. <said>It first came to me when I
imagined you were his son. Though the cruel, hard-
hearted man deserved to die, though I had determined
<pb n="213"/>
upon my vengeance either by my hand or Quamina's,
I felt I could not bring myself to do it after I'd seen
you and after your bravery. I suppose I must have
loved you even then, but I didn't know it. Perhaps
that had something to do with my running from you.
Do you forgive me?</said></p>

<p>Her frankness, her freedom from affectation, invested
her with a new charm. The orthodox love-making of
those days was stilted and simpering. Nyra's simplicity
and directness sounded to Jack delightfully fresh. What
could he do but renew his kisses?</p>

<p><said>But when I found you were no more connected with
Simon Halstead than I was, my thoughts went back to
revenge. I wrestled with myself. I wanted you to
think well of me. I hated imagining your knowing I
could do so horrible a thing as was in my mind. I
conquered my evil temptations and—and you love
me!</said></p>

<p><said>And yet you would leave me.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I must—I must. You see, there is Quamina.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, what about him?</said></p>

<p><said>He's just the same. He's never ceased craving for
vengeance. He's half a savage, you know, poor fellow,</said>
she added apologetically. <said>That's why I want to take
him back with me to Barbados.</said></p>

<p>The whole business was now clear. For all that,
Ralstone could not see why she should sacrifice herself
and her love for him for an ignorant barbarian of a
negro, but maybe the call of the blood in her had its
influence.</p>

<p>However, he would not argue the point. He also had
his plan, and he intended to work it out without telling
her anything until he had accomplished it.</p>

<p>The rain had now ceased. The moon was shining
brightly, and the fleecy clouds sweeping across it did not
dim its brightness materially. They set out to walk
back to Covent Garden. The storm had cleared the
streets of passenger traffic, and they hardly met a single
person on their way to King Street. Ralstone did not
hesitate to see her to the house, for Quamina would not
return for quite an hour.</p>

<pb n="214"/>

<p><said>Will you be on the bridge to-morrow night?</said> were
his parting words.</p>

<p><said>I don't know. I will try.</said></p>

<p><said>I shall be there. I may have some news for you.</said></p>

<p>One last kiss and he tore himself away.</p>

<head type="main">Jack Ralstone Follows His Luck</head>

<p>An hour or so after leaving King Street, Ralstone was
walking slowly along St. James's Street, Piccadilly.
He stopped now at one house, then at another, looked
up at their sedate, and in some cases shabby, fronts, and
went on. He jingled the guineas in his pockets, and
when he stopped again it was opposite a modest-looking
house on the front-door of which was a brass plate
bearing the inscription <q>C. Jones, Coal Merchant.</q> Not
a window was lighted. A harmless-looking place indeed,
the household doubtless keeping proper hours for it
was nearly eleven o'clock. But Jack Ralstone knew
better. Once through its portals the visitor, if he had
sufficient imagination and sufficient foolishness, could
picture the <q>potentiality of growing rich beyond the
dreams of avarice.</q> The house, in fact, was one of
the most notorious gaming-hells in London. Here
roulette, or <q>roly-poly,</q> as the punters called it, was
nightly played.</p>

<p><said>No. I'll not risk <q>roly-poly,</q></said> muttered Ralstone.
<said>I've heard that it can be worked in favour of the
bank.</said></p>

<p>Some of the revolving tables were fitted with a spring,
which could he worked by the foot and the ball made to
roll into the compartment marked <emph>zero</emph>, when of course
all the players lost.</p>

<p>Ralstone had made up his mind to follow his luck,
which he considered had been all in his favour since he
had been in London. True, he had spent all his winnings
over Spring <abbr><foreign xml:lang="la">v.</foreign></abbr> Neate—some £500—in two months, but
he had had a good run for his money. He put on one
<pb n="215"/>
side the £100 owed him by Weare, the moneylender,
and Sir Phineas Tenbury's £4,000. He had won the
most lovable girl in the world, and this piece of good
luck counterbalanced everything.</p>

<p>At the same time he regretted his recklessness. If
he hadn't been such a spendthrift he would have had
enough money to take Nyra and himself, with Quamina
thrown in, to Barbados—that was, if his duel with
Tenbury could be brought off in time and successfully.
His fear, however, was that Tenbury meant to back out,
and that neither the £4,000 nor the fight would be forth-
coming.</p>

<p>Ralstone was far too impetuous to wait for un-
certainties to decide themselves. He wanted to take
the money to Nyra at once. It would be such a proof
of his sincerity. And he had but £20 in the world, all
that remained of Walsham's loan!</p>

<p>He had two courses open to him. He might go to a
moneylender or to a gaming-house. The first meant
delay; security (he hadn't any to offer, and he wouldn't
bring a friend into his difficulties) and the possibility of
being landed in the King's Bench prison if he could not
meet the repayment, which was extremely likely. The
second might bring him a fortune or—sudden death.
But there was the element of luck, and luck appealed
to him just now. Besides, £20 was such a paltry sum,
it might as well be nothing at all. So here he was
prowling about the purlieus of St. James's Palace, where
gambling hells most abounded.</p>

<p>No den in St. James's Street appealed to him, for
what reason he could not quite determine, save that
they were all more or less shady, and he crossed the road
into St. James's Square and went eastward. He was
inclined to favour what was known as the <q>Dandy
House</q> at the corner of Bury Street and Jermyn Street.
Outwardly, it was of a higher class than the blackleg
establishments of St. James's Street, but in principle it
was exactly the same. Here Ralstone knew that he
might meet some of his brother Corinthians. He had
a repugnance to rubbing shoulders against raffish. men,
<pb n="216"/>
who for all their fine clothes were bullies and little better
than thieves.</p>

<p>Like all the dens where gambling was carried on, the
exterior of the <q>Dandy House</q> was very modest and
unpretentious. Laws against keeping a common gaming-
house were in force, but, unless there was a direct com-
plaint, rarely acted upon. To enter was easy enough,
as Ralstone found, but in the centre of the hall he was
brought up by a door, in which was a small spy-hole.
He had to wait while he was being inspected by the
Cerberus on the other side, and his appearance being
deemed satisfactory, he was admitted and ushered up
a staircase. At the top was another gate, but this
was <emph>open sesame</emph> after his approval down below. Then
followed the swinging back of an iron door on the
landing, and he found himself in the saloon.</p>

<p>The apartment was of considerable size, with plain
panelled walls, and lighted in the centre by a crystal
chandelier, holding some twenty or thirty candles,
which, with the assistance of the prismatic pendants,
threw a glare upon the centre of a long, oblong, green
baize-covered table about six yards long by two and
a half broad. Some eighteen inches from each end were
two spaces, one red and the other black, about three feet
and a half long by two feet and a half broad. <foreign xml:lang="fr">Rouge et
noir</foreign> was the game played.</p>

<p>The table was surrounded by men, some sitting, others
standing, whose eyes were fixed intently on the table
and on the croupiers, who acted as dealers. The game
was the essence of simplicity, and of course in favour
of the bank. All you had to do was to stake your
money on the colour you fancied and the croupiers did
the rest.</p>

<p>The cards were valued thus: court cards as ten pips,
aces for one, and the rest as marked. The dealer started
with the black space, throwing out the cards one by one
and stopping as soon as the pips exceeded thirty. When
this came about he called out <q>One.</q> Then he passed
to the red, and if the cards he dealt on this side exceeded
the number of pips on the black, red lost, and the
croupiers raked in the red stakes.</p>

<pb n="217"/>

<p>Frequently both colours turned up thirty-one. This,
was called a <foreign xml:lang="fr">one après</foreign>. The money staked on each side
was drawn in, and the players could either halve their
stakes with the bank or trust to the chance of the next
event. But to the man who staked on the winning
colour in the succeeding round, no profit came. He
only got back the money he had originally ventured.
The bank, on the other hand, took all the stakes of the
losers, so that every time a thirty-one <foreign xml:lang="fr">après</foreign> happened,
half the money on the table went into its coffers.
Obviously it was to the advantage of the bank every
time an <foreign xml:lang="fr">après</foreign> was called.</p>

<p>Ralstone did not join in the play at once. He could
have done so without much risk, as the stakes could be
as low as five shillings, rising to £20, which was the
maximum, save under certain conditions. If anyone
put down a £50 or a £100 note, it must be placed face
upwards, and the bank had the option of accepting or
rejecting it. Jack was at first more interested in the
gamblers and spectators, and looked around to see if
anyone he knew was present.</p>

<p>It was easy to tell the <soCalled>pigeons</soCalled> from the <soCalled>hawks.</soCalled>
The majority of the former were young men, with
more money than brains, and what they had of the last
was muddled by the drinks, which were freely handed
about and for which no charge was made. The <soCalled>hawks</soCalled>
were apparently well dressed until you looked closely
at the cloth of their coats, worn threadbare by constant
brushing, and at the colour of their linen. Some had
their hair and whiskers dyed, and their low-crowned
beaver hats were for the most part the worse for wear
and limp of brim. A few were playing, and when they
grabbed their winnings the croupier pushed towards
them, they noisily proclaimed the fact. They were
probably decoys.</p>

<p>Others of a different type lounged about, apparently
bent upon killing time, and paid little attention to the
table. They had their eyes fixed upon every stranger
who entered, and summed him up with the accuracy of
long practice. Their duty was to encourage the coy and
timid ones, and to whisper how they had been winners,
<pb n="218"/>
how many times red or black had been lucky in
succession, and how they regretted the chances they
had missed.</p>

<p>A waiter came up to Ralstone with a tray of glasses
filled with champagne. Jack refused the drink.</p>

<p><said>There's nothing to pay, sir. The establishment's
liberal—most liberal. It's really Liberty Hall here,</said> a
voice from behind was heard saying.</p>

<p>Ralstone turned round sharply. He recognised the
small pointed chin, the high cheek-bones, the narrow
forehead, and the long, thin face. The speaker was
Weare, the moneylender and gambling sharper. Directly
his eyes fell on Ralstone he started and would have
slunk away. Jack gripped his arm.</p>

<p><said>Not so fast, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Weare. I fancy we have a little
matter of business—hardly one of honour—to thrash
out. You owe me £100, which I'm going to ask you to
pay. What's your answer?</said></p>

<p><said>'Pon my word, sir, I don't understand you; you
must mistake me for some one else.</said></p>

<p><said>Impossible. I should think, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Weare, you're the
last man in the world to have a double. I repeat that
you owe me £100 on a bet you made at <q>The Angel and
Sun,</q> outside Bath, on the Andover fight. If you doubt
me, suppose we take a coach to Tom Belcher's. He
was there, you know, and heard all that passed.</said></p>

<p>Weare looked horribly uncomfortable. Not long
since Tom Belcher had kicked him out of his house,
<q>The Castle,</q> Holborn, for some shady transaction in
which he had swindled one of Tom's best customers.
Weare wouldn't face Belcher on any account.</p>

<p><said>I think I've some recollection of the bet you speak
of now that you remind me. I'm very sorry. It quite
slipped my memory.</said></p>

<p><said>Really? In spite of my reminder on the ring side
after the fight. Perhaps you've forgotten the hiding I
gave to your champion, Thurtell? If you have, I should
be very pleased to refresh your memory in your own
person. Suppose we adjourn to the quietude of St.
James's Square? We're not likely to be interfered.with
there at this time of night.</said></p>

<pb n="219"/>

<p><said>Oh dear, no. I—I remember you now, sir. Of
course you shall have your money. I'll make a memo-
randum to send it you to-morrow. Where are you
staying?</said></p>

<p>Weare went through a parade of taking out a pocket-
book with a flourish and biting the end of a very worn
lead pencil.</p>

<p><said>You needn't trouble,</said> rejoined Ralstone coldly. <said>I
mean to be paid <emph>now</emph>.</said></p>

<p><said>My dear sir, I can't do it—I really can't. I've very
little money on me.</said></p>

<p><said>You do yourself an injustice, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Weare. I happen
to know that you never go anywhere without carrying
your entire exchequer with you. Ready money enables
you to complete a money-lending transaction on the
spot; no doubt very useful to reckless gamblers who've
come to the bottom of their pockets, and I dare say it
enables you to exact a usurious profit. At least, so I
hear from some of the Bow Street runners. So you see
you've a reputation to keep up. Look here,</said> went on
Ralstone, suddenly changing his tone, <said>unless you fork
out I shall be forced to upset the harmony of this place.
I shall denounce you first and punch your head after-
wards. I dare say I shall get support from the decent
men here. They're not all blacklegs, I expect.</said></p>

<p><said>Pray do nothing so rash,</said> returned Weare agi-
tatedly. <said>I'll try to find something on account and
send you the rest.</said></p>

<p><said>Very well, that'll do. Say fifty pounds.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh dear, no. I can't manage a farthing more than
twenty-five pounds, and that'll leave me nothing to go
on with.</said></p>

<p><said>Rather a new sensation for you, I fancy. I don't
want to be hard. Hand over the twenty-five pounds
and forward the balance to me at the <q>Tavistock.</q></said></p>

<p>Weare's long, thin face became thinner and more
shrunken, but he was driven into an awkward corner,
and had no alternative. He put his hand beneath his
coat and appeared to be struggling to reach the small
of his back. The result of his wriggling was the pro-
duction of a small, thin pocket-book. How many notes
<pb n="220"/>
it contained Weare was careful not to let Ralstone see,
but he extracted five five-pound notes, which he grudg-
ingly held out.</p>

<p><said>Thanks,</said> said Ralstone. <said>That leaves seventy-five
pounds you owe. Hope you'll keep your word and send
the balance to-morrow.</said></p>

<p>And he strolled to the table, leaving Weare scowling
and muttering. It may here be noted that Weare's
practice of carrying his capital with him in various
secret pockets concealed about his person led to his
undoing. Four months later—in the month of
November—he was lying dead in a lane near Elstree,
butchered by Thurtell and his gang, to get the money
which they knew he had somewhere in his dress.</p>

<p>Ralstone stood a few minutes watching the game and
noting the number of times in succession the black or
the red won. He was elated by the stroke of good
fortune which had sent him against Weare. His luck
had pursued him, and he was tempted to pursue it.
When a waiter approached him with champagne he
tossed off a glass. It was vile-doctored stuff, and a
small quantity was guaranteed to bring on semi-
intoxication in the shortest possible time, but Jack did
not know this.</p>

<p>Black had won no less than seven times running.
There was odd magic in the number seven, Ralstone
had heard. It was time red had its turn. He threw
down a guinea on the red. He was successful, and
wished he had placed twenty times the amount. This
would have given him all the money he wanted, and he
would then have left the saloon. But the champagne
had not destroyed all his caution, and at the next deal
he contented himself with staking five guineas. Again
he won.</p>

<p><said>Your luck's in, sir. Don't spoil a good chance by
a faint heart,</said> whispered his neighbour, a very dark,
curly-haired man with heavy, bloated features. He
was quite six feet high and very muscular. He had
some friends with him who addressed him as Probert.</p>

<p><said>Oh, my heart's good enough,</said> said <choice><corr>Jack</corr><orig>Jeck</orig></choice> with a
careless laugh. <said>It's my luck that's the thing.</said></p>

<pb n="221"/>

<p><said>Well, sir, I drink to it. You're game, I can see,
and I like pluck, whether it's with cards, women or
wine. You'll have a glass with me?</said></p>

<p>The waiter was just behind them. Ralstone hesi-
tated, but his throat was parched. The champagne he
had drunk had given him a craving for more. And the
fever of gambling was in his veins. He seized a glass
and accepted Probert's challenge.</p>

<p>At the next deal he plunged. It was to be his last
venture, win or lose. He staked his winnings, his
original stakes, and added twenty pounds. He stood to
make a hundred pounds. The croupier began to throw
out cards to black—three tens and one ace, thirty-one!
Ralstone held his breath and his pulse quickened. The
dealer seemed unconsciously slow in dealing to red, but
it was not so. Ralstone's anxiety had deceived him.
Two tens and a nine appeared; all depended upon the
fourth card. It proved to be the two. Red and black
had each scored thirty-one! It was an <foreign xml:lang="fr">après</foreign>, and the
stakes on both sides were drawn into a space at the end
of the table marked off from the red and black by a
yellow line.</p>

<p>Ralstone could now either halve his stake with the
bank or leave it and take his chance of the next deal.
In the first case he would lose half his money, in the
second he would, if lucky, get back his stake, but he
would gain nothing. He elected to do the second.</p>

<p>It took some little time to return the money of those
who had decided to put up with losing half their stakes,
and then the excitement increased. Ralstone's stake
was by far the highest on the table. He watched the
dealer closely, not that he suspected anything wrong,
but on the pack depended his fate. His eye, trained
by snipe and wild duck shooting, and strengthened by
his practice in the fencing-room, was exceptionally
quick, and rarely played him false. The dealer went on
mechanically. The black worked out at thirty, the red
at thirty-three. Ralstone had lost. The croupier
extended his rake to sweep in his gains.</p>

<p><said>Stop!</said> suddenly yelled Ralstone. <said>This is cheat-
ing. I saw the croupier shift the bottom card to the
<pb n="222"/>
top of the pack. The red and black were both thirty.
The last card he should have thrown to the red is
this.</said></p>

<p>He was standing close to the dealer. Quick as thought
his hand went out to the pack from which the cards had
been dealt. He lifted the top card before anyone could
prevent him, and threw it on the table face upward.
It was an ace. If it had been dealt, red would have
won.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a terrific uproar. Ralstone, his
brain inflamed by the hocussed wine, made a grab at
the gold and notes the croupier was raking in, but only
succeeded in scattering the money. At the same
moment a pair of powerful arms pinned him from
behind, and the shrill voice of Weare was heard shriek-
ing. <said>Out with him. He's a spy. He's sent by the
Bow Street Robin Redbreasts.</said></p>

<p>Professional punters, decoys, blacklegs and friends of
the proprietor were in the majority. They pressed
round the audacious visitor, bent on acting upon
Weare's cry. But they had reckoned without Ralstone's
strength and activity. Suddenly raising his foot, he
stuck it against the edge of the table to obtain leverage,
shot his body back with all his force, and using his
elbows like wedges, cleaved his way through the seeth-
ing mass. In less than a minute he had shaken himself
free, and his chest heaving, his eyes glaring and his lips
white and set he stood awaiting the onrush.</p>

<p>But it did not come. Blacklegs are not bruisers, and
what they lacked in courage they made up for in shouts
and oaths. Presently the crowd parted, a man elbowed
his way through. It was Probert, with whom Ralstone
had hobnobbed. He was followed by a couple of men
evidently emboldened by Probert's example. They
meant mischief. Instantly Ralstone was on his guard.</p>

<p>Probert made a rush. His attitude and the way he
held his hands told Jack that though he knew a little
about boxing, that knowledge did not amount to much.
He opened with a rush, and launched a heavy blow at
Ralstone's head. Jack ducked, received it on his
shoulder and retaliated by a smasher full in Probert's
<pb n="223"/>
face, of much the same character as that which some
forty years later floored Jem Mace when he fought Tom
King. Ralstone's fist, hardened by use, caught the
man on the nose and between the eyes, and accentuated
by the weight of his body infused into the blow, sent him
crashing to the ground, and there he lay, not insensible,
but unable to move. His comrades did not wait to try
further conclusions with so doughty a fighter and
precipitately retreated.</p>

<p>The hubbub increased ,and some one began to blow
out the lights in the chandelier. At this juncture Ral-
stone was joined by one of the players, a young man
of gentlemanly appearance.</p>

<p><said>You'd better get out quick,</said> he whispered. <said>You
were right. The scoundrel cheated you, but you've
no remedy. The croupier has vanished with the swag,
and if the room's darkened you won't have a dog's
chance. The blackguards mean mischief. They're col-
lecting the empty bottles, and you'll have a devil of a
volley in half a minute.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone appreciated the wisdom of this advice. He
wheeled round, and as he was turning, caught sight of
Weare with a champagne bottle creeping towards him,
so as to get a better aim. Jack Ralstone had not been
a cricketer for nothing. He saw the missile coming;
he caught it neatly and returned it as though he was
aiming to get a batsman out. The bottle struck the
moneylender on the temple, and he went down like a
cricket stump. Then Ralstone and his companion
dashed for the door, upset the custodian as though he
were a ninepin, and fled down the stairs three at a time.
The guardian of the lobby door, a burly fellow with a
fighter's broken nose, would have stopped them, but
they were ready for him.</p>

<p><said>Keep the door open,</said> shouted Ralstone. <said>The place
is on fire!</said></p>

<p>The man did not ask any questions, but bolted
upstairs to see for himself. The two fugitives darted
into the street, made for Shepherd's Market, and, once
in the maze of passages which then existed, were safe
from pursuit. They found their way into the Hay-
<pb n="224"/>
market, and walked rapidly towards Charing Cross.</p>

<p><said>Did you lose much?</said> asked Ralstone, when they
could talk freely.</p>

<p><said>Cleaned out. And you?</said></p>

<p><said>Almost the same. I went in with twenty pounds.
I spotted that thief Weare and extracted twenty-five
pounds out of a hundred-pound bet he owed me—it
was like drawing blood from a stone—started play and,
despite winning at first, I've lost forty pounds out of
my capital.</said></p>

<p><said>You squeezed twenty-five pounds out of Weare!
Damne, you worked a miracle. How did you manage
it?</said></p>

<p><said>Frightened him. Threatened to punch his head and
tell to the room why.</said></p>

<p><said>By Gad, that explains it.</said></p>

<p><said>Explains what?</said></p>

<p><said>Just before the last deal—the <foreign xml:lang="fr">après</foreign>, you know, that
finished the lot of us—I twigged Weare whispering
to the croupier, and glancing at you. You were so
intent on watching the cards you didn't notice. He
was arranging the trick to get his own back.</said></p>

<p><said>And he got it with a vengeance. He won't be
seen in public for a week, I'll swear. By the way, do
you know the fellow they called Probert, who made a
dead set at me?</said></p>

<p><said>I don't know any good of him. A boaster and
bragger, and, I'm told, a close pal of that man Thurtell,
who's to be seen often at that den. It's a wonder he
wasn't there to-night.</said></p>

<p>A friend of Thurtell Probert was indeed, for it was
in the pond of his garden at Elstree that the body of
Weare was thrown after being murdered.</p>

<p>On the whole, in spite of his being fleeced, Ralstone
had reason to congratulate himself, for he had wiped
out the score against him which had started at the
Andover fight. Thurtell—Weare—and now Probert,
who probably saw him at the <q>Fives Court</q> row, and
who might have been one of the gang that so brutally
attacked him. One debtor remained—Sir Phineas
Tenbury.</p>

<pb n="225"/>

<p>At Charing Cross Ralstone parted from his companion,
each wishing the other better luck, and went on to
the <q>Tavistock,</q> feeling somewhat giddy, for the fumes
of the doctored champagne were not completely dis-
sipated. He was not in a condition to think over things,
and he had no sooner thrown himself into bed than he
was in a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning brought painful recollection. He
came to the conclusion that he had made an ass of him-
self—at all events as far as losing his money was con-
cerned. The problem of raising sufficient to help Nyra
still faced him. Walsham would probably lend him
another fifty pounds, but this was not nearly enough.
A hundred pounds would hardly do what he wanted.</p>

<p><said>If it weren't for that long-legged blackamoor she
mightn't want to leave England at all. Why should
she? I can see what's in her mind. She wants to
keep the fellow from doing that infernal stepfather of
mine an injury. I'll swear Quamina will finish the job
in workmanlike style if he has half a chance. But
Simon's safe enough where he is. What does the negro
know about England? He'd never find his way down
to Somersetshire. I don't think I need bother over the
Squire.</said></p>

<p>And he dismissed Simon Halstead (towards whom, in
spite of Nyra's moving story, he had a spark of kindly
feeling, for he had nothing personally to complain of—
it was rather the other way about) from his mind.</p>

<p>But Nyra was different. Looking at his duel with
Sir Phineas seriously, it might mean his own death.
He had not hitherto troubled to regard it in this light,
but now, as things had turned out, it had to be reckoned
with.</p>

<p><said>While I'm near at hand I defy Tenbury to harm my
darling, but supposing I was heavily grassed, and the
sponge had to be thrown up? God knows what would
happen then. She must be got out of the country
before the last act comes. It's the only way.</said></p>

<p>He was slowly dressing while these thoughts were
chasing each other, and at the end of his toilet he had
made up his mind what his next step should be. It
<pb n="226"/>
was a desperate project which at odd times had flitted
across his brain.</p>

<p>Within the next hour he was at Tom Spring's house,
The Weymouth Arms, Weymouth Street, Portman
Square. Spring, who was in the bar, greeted the
visitor heartily, and surveyed him with a critical eye.</p>

<p><said>You're not much the worse, sir, for your turn up
with that blackguard Thurtell and the ugly work that
followed. I got together a lot of our chaps when we
heard what was going on, and we went out to lend you
a hand, but the mischief was done. You ought to have
taken my advice, sir.</said></p>

<p><said>Of course I ought, Tom. Anyhow, I shan't go
against it another time, and, as a matter of fact, I'm
here to seek it.</said></p>

<p>In a few words he disclosed his project. It was to
issue a challenge to any one who chose to take it up.
He meant to back himself, and he meant to win.</p>

<p><said>The long and short of it is, Spring, I want five
hundred pounds in as short a time as possible, and I
look to you to help me to get it.</said></p>

<p><said>'Tain't so easy as you think, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone,</said> said
Spring, shaking his head. <said>You're not in the same
class as the old 'uns. Besides, I don't think they'd care
to fight a gentleman.</said></p>

<p><said>I should take another name.</said></p>

<p><said>That wouldn't make a bit of difference. You'd
be known just the same. What about the stakes? If
you pulled 'em off it wouldn't mean more than fifty
pounds. The nobs wouldn't put down more than twenty-
five pounds on an unknown man.</said></p>

<p><said>I'd easily get some of my friends to subscribe a
decent sum.</said></p>

<p><said>I know you Corinthian gentlemen stick to one
another. It's the other side I'm thinking about. And,
according to you, the pull's to come out of the betting.
You can't guarantee you'll win. The best man in the
world can't. And there mustn't be the slightest
suspicion of a <soCalled>cross.</soCalled></said></p>

<p><said>What are you talking about, Tom?</said> cried Ralstone
indignantly. <said>A <soCalled>cross</soCalled>—I should think not indeed.</said></p>

<pb n="227"/>

<p><said>That's what I'm saying. Now, look 'ee here.
There's a man down Wapping way that the East Enders
are bragging about. I've not seen him, but I'm told
he's a glutton for punishment and as full of tricks as a
monkey. He's on for a match, but his backers can't
spring more'n twenty-five pounds. I don't say you'd
beat him, but you've got more than a fighting chance.
I'll make inquiries about him if you like.</said></p>

<p><said>I wish you would, Tom. The sooner the better.</said></p>

<p>And after half an hour's sparring with Spring, during
which Tom pointed out a few defects, but pronounced
his pupil on the whole to be greatly improved in the
strength of his punches and in his quickness in getting
away, Jack departed much comforted.</p>

<head type="main">East Against West</head>

<p>The <q>Blue Anchor,</q> Oyster-shell Alley, Wapping, was
a typical waterside tavern, neither better nor worse than
any other between Limehouse and Westminster. It
was at the corner of the alley. At the end of the latter
ran the Thames, reached by a flight of slimy, uneven
steps, partly of brick, partly of lumps of stone. A
tumble-down. weather-boarded structure, the <q>Blue
Anchor</q> was so lopsided that it looked as if a vigorous
push would send it toppling into the river. A bay
window, the frame of which had long ceased acquaint-
ance with paint, projecting from the ground-floor room,
would certainly not have required much pushing to
separate it from the house, had it not been shored up
by two stout beams driven into the shingle below. The
<q>Blue Anchor</q> would have delighted a modern artist,
but he would have thought twice before he sampled its
beer or rum.</p>

<p>In the room with the bay-window, amid squalid
surroundings. in a leather-covered arm-chair, worn rusty
by long usage, sat, or rather lounged, the fine gentleman,
Sir Phineas Tenbury. He was supposed to be in Paris;
<pb n="228"/>
he was in hiding at the <q>Blue Anchor.</q> Always
vicious-looking, he was now at his worst. The grey
shade of dissipation and sleepless nights had crept over
his face. His eyes, since the tragic episode in Cran-
bourne Alley, had in them the restless glance of the
hunted man. He had been horribly nervous about Lady
Barbara's pearls, and he had determined to lie low until
he was sure <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews had not given him away,
and that the loss of the necklace had not been dis-
covered. A fortnight had gone over, nothing had hap-
pened to cause him uneasiness, and he was beginning
to feel less anxious.</p>

<p>He had not the slightest difficulty in accounting for
his seeking refuge at the <q>Blue Anchor.</q> He was, he
said, being pursued by duns, writs were out against him,
and he had no desire to be lodged in a Cursitor Street
sponging house. The story was highly credible, and
Sam Appleby, the landlord, who knew Sir Phineas well,
never thought of questioning it.</p>

<p>Tenbury had another reason for selecting the <q>Blue
Anchor.</q> It was the house of call of Sally Winch and
her son Jerry, and Sally he was employing to watch
Ralstone in place of Vicary. Sally had got work in
Covent Garden market, and was able to combine pea-
shelling with spying. Ralstone, it was pretty certain,
would never suspect her. Sir Phineas was now awaiting
her first report.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Appleby put his shock head into
the room.</p>

<p><said>'Ere's the old 'oman,</said> said he in a beery voice.</p>

<p><said>I'll see her.</said></p>

<p>Sally had brought her son with her, but she left him
in the bar. She bobbed cringingly and commenced her
story. She had brought news. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone had left
the <q>Tavistock</q> and was staying with Tom Spring
at the Weymouth Arms.</p>

<p><said>How did you find that out?</said> growled Tenbury.</p>

<p><said>It warn't me, yer 'onour, as diskivered it. It war
Jerry. He'll tell 'ee all about it, sir. He's outside
now.</said></p>

<p><said>Bring him in.</said></p>

<pb n="229"/>

<p>Her offspring slouched in, touching his forelock. He
was a different Jerry from the drunken bruiser who had
gone down under Jack Ralstone's fist on the common on
the Bristol and Bath Road. He had never forgotten
the humiliation of his defeat, he the <soCalled>milling</soCalled> champion
of many a boxing-booth fight, by an amateur! He was
burning to reinstate his reputation, for somehow the
story had got wind. He had turned over a new leaf.
He had reduced his potations of <soCalled>heavy wet</soCalled> and had
put himself under the care of a trainer of men and
horses. His constant outdoor life and exercise, running
and riding, had made him as hard as nails. His face
was no longer red and bloated, but lean and bronzed.
He had lost a stone in weight and had now the litheness
of body and the firmness of muscular development of
the born fighter.</p>

<p><said>What d'ye think, Sir Phineas?</said> he began excitedly.
<said>That theer C'rinthian as you put t'old mother to
foller is a goin' in for a <q>ring</q> match. I want ter take
'im on. 'Im an' me's got a score ter settle, as <emph>you</emph>
know. You've only got to plank down twenty-five
shiners an' I'll 'arf kill my fine genelman.</said></p>

<p>Jerry had adorned his story with a few oaths which
may be omitted, and finished by spitting on both palms
and clenching his fists.</p>

<p>Tenbury's dull eyes lightened. He saw the change in
the burly ruffian and noted the brawny neck and
shoulders. Jerry was likely to prove a formidable
antagonist. It would be something towards his revenge
if his rival were crippled—the loss of an eye—the bridge
of his nose smashed—his jaw broken—anything so
long as his good looks were permanently ruined.</p>

<p><said>Are you sure?</said> he asked eagerly.</p>

<p><said>Sartin' sure. I was a-sparrin' at <q>The Feathers,</q>
Ratcliff 'Ighway, t'other night; blest if I didn't see
Spring among the landlord's friends a-quizzin' me.
The C'rinthian's a-comin' out as Bob 'Umphries, but
it's Ralstone all the same. Spring's a-lookin' out fur
a man to meet 'im, an' he wanted to see if I was good
enough. Good enough? Oh, lor!</said></p>

<p>And Jerry spat once more, this time on the ground.</p>

<pb n="230"/>

<p><said>If I find the money, will the match come off?</said>
asked Tenbury, biting his nails.</p>

<p><said>I'll take my oath it will.</said></p>

<p><said>Come here to-morrow. I'll see what I can do.
Meanwhile your mother must hang about the Wey-
mouth Arms. And you might keep your eyes open
too. I want every step of Ralstone's dogged. D'ye
understand?</said></p>

<p>Jerry nodded, his mother cackled, and the precious
pair departed with the few shillings Sir Phineas found
for them. Then he had a consultation with Sam
Appleby. The purport was the disposal of some
jewellery which Sir Phineas had determined upon
selling, so as to get free of his pressing liabilities and
enable him to come out into the open. Appleby had
heard that a Dutch Jew had come over from Antwerp
on business, and could be seen at a house in the Minories.
The Jew was a dealer in precious stones.</p>

<p><said>Is he good for £5,000?</said></p>

<p><said>Any amount, so I've heard tell. Them Jews hang
together, an' what one ain't got another makes up.
They're always on fur a deal. I'll get the address some
time this afternoon.</said></p>

<p>Appleby was as good as his word. That evening Sir
Phineas interviewed a grey-bearded man in a long
gabardine, and drove a hard bargain for the pearls. He
wanted £5000; Solomon Sluys would only give £4,000.
They compromised for £4,250. The next day Jerry and
his trainer were at the <q>Blue Anchor,</q> the £25 was
handed over and deposited, as was duly notified in the
next issue of <title>Bell's Life</title>.</p>

<p>There was to be no delay in bringing matters to an
issue. Both men were in good fettle and were eager
for the fight. From the East End point of view, Spring's
<soCalled>novice</soCalled> hadn't the ghost of a chance against Jerry
Winch, who had been boxing week in and week out
six months of the year ever since he was out of his teens.
True, he had mostly had ambitious <soCalled>duffers</soCalled> to deal
with on the race-courses and at fairs where his mother's
boxing booth was pitched, but the milling, such as it
was, kept him in condition.</p>

<pb n="231"/>
<p>Apart from the confidence they had in their man,
Winch's supporters had prided themselves on the fact
that it was the East against the West, for it had oozed
out that <soCalled>Bob Humphries</soCalled> was a swell and a Corinthian
to boot. In a way this feeling suited Jack Ralstone's
book, as it enabled him to accept the bets which the
backers of Winch were quite ready to make. If he won,
Jack saw his way to the £500 he wanted. But it was
going to be a near thing. Spring warned him that his
opponent was likely to prove a tough customer.</p>

<p>The place for the fight was kept as much of a secret
as was possible, but it was known to a few that the
historic battle ground of Moulsey Hurst had been
chosen. For the moment the day was left open. Mean-
while Ralstone passed his time between Spring's house
and lodgings he had taken at Hampstead. Here, amid
beautiful and wild surroundings, he did his open-air
training, winding up the day with a walk to Waterloo
Bridge and back on the off-chance of meeting Nyra.</p>

<p>Happy meetings they were when fortune favoured
them. By mutual yet tacit agreement both avoided
talking of anything outside their new-found love, and
this subject seemed inexhaustible. Nyra, in some way
which Ralstone never sought to know, had found means
to put off Quamina, for the black no longer accompanied
her.</p>

<p>A fortnight passed quickly, and then came a surprise.
Jack heard from Lord Walsham that Sir Phineas
Tenbury had returned from Paris and was again to be
seen in his old haunts. Two days after Walsham found
his way to Flask Walk, where Ralstone had his rooms,
with an important piece of news.</p>

<p>Walsham threw a slip of paper on the table.</p>

<p><said>Tenbury's cheque for £4,000,</said> said he. <said>The fellow
seems to have squeezed Houston to some purpose.
Captain Charteris brought it to me this morning. I
rather fancy it was due to Charteris's scruples rather
than because Tenbury thought he ought to pay you,
that he scraped the money together. Anyhow, you're
in funds. You don't seem overjoyed.</said></p>

<p>And indeed Ralstone's face was unusually grave.</p>

<pb n="232"/>

<p><said>It's come too late. Three weeks ago I might have
welcomed it. 1 should have been saved my venture into
the prize ring. I can't back out now. If I suggested
such a thing it would be said I was showing the white
feather.</said></p>

<p><said>But no one knows you're <soCalled>Bob Humphries.</soCalled></said></p>

<p><said>Spring does. I can't sell him. He'd never look at
me again. You don't know the trouble he's taken to
put me up to every move. Besides, I've been thinking
over the matter, and I've decided that I won't be
indebted to Tenbury for being able to bring off the
plan I've got in my mind. I'll make the money I want
by my own efforts or not at all. What d'you say?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, I know nothing about it, but I dare say
you're right.</said></p>

<p><said>I feel I am. I've never told you the facts about
the girl I'm fighting for. Tenbury was villain enough
to employ a gang of ruffians to carry her off one night
as she was coming from Vauxhall Gardens, where she
had been singing—perhaps you may have heard Nyra?</said></p>

<p><said>The deuce! So it's Nyra, the charming singer the
town went mad over some months ago, is it? Heaps
of men have been wondering what has become of her.
By Jupiter, Ralstone, you're in luck. But Sir Phineas
—so he got hold of her, did he?</said></p>

<p><said>He tried to, but failed. The blackguards in his
pay—a beast of an old woman and her son were the
ringleaders; I gave the scoundrel a thrashing and I'd like
to give him another—took her to Somersetshire, and
I rescued her. I rode with her to Bath; she ran away
for reasons which I needn't go into; we met again in
London, and now she's mine. I've reason to believe
Tenbury's moving heaven and earth to find her, but he
won't. I want to take her away after I've settled with
the fellow. That's why I won't touch a farthing of his
money.</said></p>

<p><said>What am I to do with his cheque, then?</said></p>

<p><said>Haven't made up my mind. Keep it in your pos-
session for the present.</said></p>

<p>Within another week the day for the fight was fixed,
<pb n="233"/>
and it was soon buzzed about that it was to come off
at Moulsey Hurst.</p>

<p>The Thames never looked more inviting for a swim, a
row, or a sail, than on this August morning; but the
crowds, both of the washed and unwashed, streaming
over Hampton Court Bridge, besieging the ferry boats
at Hampton, and blocking up the roads with drags,
curricles, tandems, gigs, and every kind of vehicle that
could be pressed into service, had no thoughts of these
harmless pleasures. Nor did they care for the beauty of
the pastoral surroundings or the bright sunshine, save
that the latter meant bodily comfort. Their minds were
fixed on seeing two men batter each other about. Nor
did they care a straw for the nobility of the manly art
of self-defence. They were out to see blood and bruises,
and to some tastes the more of both the better.</p>

<p>Jack Ralstone had put up the night before with his
mentor, Spring at Walton; thence it was an easy ride to
Moulsey Hurst, immediately opposite Hampton village.
The authorities had apparently <soCalled>winked the other
eye,</soCalled> and there was no thought of difficulties from
the magistrates. A huge multitude had assembled round
the ropes when a close carriage brought <soCalled>Bob
Humphries</soCalled> to a convenient spot cleared in readiness
by the ex-P.R. bodyguard, and expert eyes eagerly
scrutinised the representative of the <soCalled>Corinthians,</soCalled> for
it was now known to every one that Tom Spring's
<soCalled>novice</soCalled> belonged to the world of swelldom. On the
whole the verdict was satisfactory, though there were
some judges who thought that the young <soCalled>nob,</soCalled> with
his white skin, tanned though his face was by sun and
wind, and finely-drawn, sharply-defined muscular
development, would never stand the hammering which
the brawny champion of the East End had in readiness.</p>

<p>The East Enders had mustered in great force, and a
thousand and more hoarse, raucous voices hailed their
hero when he leaped over the ropes and flung his
<soCalled>castor</soCalled> into the ring. <soCalled>Gentleman</soCalled> Jackson had the
arrangements in his hands, and at the given moment
both men were at their corners. When Jack glanced
across the enclosure, curious to see what kind of man
<pb n="234"/>
he had to meet, the sun was shining full upon Jerry
Winch's face, and Ralstone gave a start of recognition.
He turned at once to Spring.</p>

<p><said>Tom,</said> said he in a low voice, <said>I've already fought
that fellow.</said></p>

<p><said>You have, sir?</said> exclaimed the surprised Spring.</p>

<p><said>Yes. I'll tell you something about it after the
fight. All I can say now is that I beat him and I mean
to do it again.</said></p>

<p><said>You've your work cut out. He'll stand any amount
of your punches. Mind he doesn't get one of his in
unawares. He can hit. Remember what I told you.
Don't force the fighting. Tire him and watch your
chance.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone nodded. The knowledge that he was pitted
against the ruffian who had done Tenbury's dirty work
gave him a sense of joy. He thought of Nyra, and he
was burning to avenge her wrongs. At the same time
he resolved that this feeling should not affect his judg-
ment. He saw he would have to be cooler and more
guarded than ever.</p>

<p>It was the reverse with Jerry Winch. His animalism
showed itself, in the impudent grin, the protruding
lower jaw, and the small, tigerish eyes deep in their
sockets. He was bursting to pound his antagonist and
gratify his love of brutality, and a curious sound, like
the snarl of a savage dog, issued from his lips as at
the appointed signal he faced the tall, lithe figure who
advanced towards him.</p>

<p>The spectators held their breath. Then something
like a sigh seemed to pass over the vast multitude. It
was a murmur of astonishment. The two combatants
had not observed the usual etiquette. Neither had
offered to shake hands. Winch's backers thought the
omission was due to the Corinthian's <soCalled>stuck-uppish-
ness.</soCalled> Ralstone's supporters put it down to Winch's
ignorance and boorishness. Then, when the astonish-
ment passed away, a jeering <q>yah</q> burst from the
outraged East Enders. As a matter of fact, the two
men knew they were out for the grim reality of fighting,
and neither was in the mood for ceremony and a pre-
tence that there was no ill-feeling.</p>

<pb n="235"/>
<p>The first round gave no hint of what was to follow.
Winch's tactics, it was clear, were of the rushing order.
He hardly gave Ralstone time to pose in the <soCalled>correct</soCalled>
attitude before he was upon him like a wild cat, sending
in blow after blow, which, had they been direct instead
of being slightly curved, might have done his opponent
some damage. He wanted to get inside Jack's guard
by a side attack, which would make the accepted rules
go for naught, but he failed. Ralstone did not escape
entirely, but there was nothing very serious. He did not
attempt to retreat, indeed the onslaught was too sudden,
and he closed instead, relying upon his skill as a
wrestler.</p>

<p>Wrestling, it so happened, was not one of Winch's
strong points. He was a Londoner born and bred, and
belonged to a hybrid class known as <soCalled>Stepney</soCalled> gipsies
—nomads who pose as gipsies when it suits them, but
have not the least trace of the true Romany blood in
them. He struggled to free himself from Ralstone's
grip, and for a time it was a hard tussle, Winch making
up for his want of knowledge by his enormous strength.
But science and practice won the day. Suddenly he
was lifted up, his body whirled in the air, and he came
down a huddled heap, breathless and quivering. He
was at once taken to his corner, and was soon ready
once more. He was not much hurt, but considerably
shaken.</p>

<p>When the second round started it could be seen that
he was mad with rage. He tried the rushing game, but
Jack was ready, and stepped back in time to avoid his
savage thrusts. Now and again Ralstone got in a
jabbing stroke, and though he found his mark on
Winch's face, the fellow's head was so hard he could
make little impression. Jerry's nose and mouth were
bleeding, but he took no heed and pressed on, Ralstone
all the time retreating. This kind of fighting was not
what Jerry had been used to in his boxing-booth en-
counters, and, after the shaking up of the first round, he
began to lose his wind. His fury was so intense that
he fought quite wildly, and Jack planted a terrific blow
<pb n="236"/>
on the <soCalled>mark</soCalled> and down he went again, doubled up
with pain. The applause was deafening as Ralstone
walked to his corner without a scratch.</p>

<p><said>That's the game,</said> said Spring, while he was attend-
ing to his man. <said>Don't let him come to close quarters.</said></p>

<p>In the third round Ralstone's straight blows fell with
unerring certainty. Jerry looked like a fiend, and,
conscious of his ability to take any amount of punish-
ment so far as his bullet head and muscular chest were
concerned, hardly tried to defend himself. He paid
the penalty at the end of the fourth round. He at-
tempted to get within Jack's guard, and made a bull-like
rush at a moment when he was short of breath, missed,
and received a direct upper-cut which caught him on the
chin and sent him flying like a ninepin. But he was
not to be denied. He came up to time and, stung by
the reproaches of his supporters, could hardly contain
himself. One blow of his got home, and Ralstone
staggered under it and went down on one knee. Jerry
did not pursue his advantage. He had his adversary at
his mercy, but his eyes were half closed; his brain was
paralysed, partly because it was naturally slow, and
partly because what there was of it was filled by his
ungovernable hatred, and he did not at once realise his
advantage. The next instant Ralstone was on both
feet and landed his man a stupendous crash between
the eyes, cutting his knuckles against Jerry's cheek-
bones, but effectually blinding him. When Winch's
backers saw his fists whirling aimlessly, they yelled out
volleys of execrations. But the round had to be finished,
and Jack closed and threw him.</p>

<p>Jerry's seconds saw there was no chance for their
man. He came to before he was counted out, struggled
to his feet, and insisted upon going on. He was livid
with mortification, and wouldn't listen to their remon-
strances. He had his way, and staggered with assistance
to the centre of the ring. He looked a pitiable object,
swaying to and fro and vainly endeavouring to see his
antagonist. Jack walked up to him, heard his gasping
oaths, and gently pushed him. Down he went.</p>

<p>The fight was over. Jerry Winch was carried to
<pb n="237"/>
his corner insensible, and a great shout rose from the
Corinthians and their friends. Jack, save a cut on his
cheek, had come through with very slight injuries. He
was surrounded and overwhelmed with congratulations.</p>

<p><said>You'd be as good as Gentleman Jackson or <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Gully,</said> said Spring, <said>if you cared.</said></p>

<p><said>No. I've had enough. I've done more than I
expected. I've thrashed an enemy,</said> returned Jack
with a smile.</p>

<p>His friends would have given him a dinner, but he
would have none of it. He had important business that
night, he said. And this was true. He had to meet
Nyra.</p>

<p>He was so excited he did not see Sir Phineas. The
baronet was whispering to a witch-like old woman who
was making her way towards the defeated Jerry. The
old hag was Sally Winch.</p>

</div>


<div n="24" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="24">XXIV</num></head>
<head type="main">The Avenger—Death</head>

<p>Ralstone had not seen Nyra for four evenings. He
paced the bridge impatiently, wondering if she would
come. He was followed through the turnstile by an
old beggar-woman, apparently a cripple. She kept on
the opposite side, and when she found that he was
walking up and down, evidently expecting some one,
she squatted in one of the recesses and kept her head
down as though asleep.</p>

<p>But she was on the alert; she saw Nyra pass, and
watched her meet Ralstone. She grinned maliciously
when they kissed.</p>

<p><said>Good news—great news, sweetheart,</said> cried Ral-
stone, joyfully. <said>I've all the money you want, and
more—at least, I shall have before the week is over.</said></p>

<p>The girl made no answer, but drew closer to him.
Did the affection expressed in the movement mean her
thanks? He waited for her to speak, but she remained
silent.</p>

<pb n="238"/>

<p><said>Aren't you glad, dearest?</said> he asked anxiously.</p>

<p><said>Oh, yes, for your sake, but——</said></p>

<p>She looked up. He saw trouble written in her eyes.</p>

<p><said>What's the matter? Has anything happened?</said></p>

<p><said>It's—it's Quamina.</said></p>

<p><said aloud="false">Damn Quamina,</said> thought Ralstone. <said aloud="false">The fellow's
a plaguey nuisance.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, what about him?</said></p>

<p><said>He's been missing for two days.</said></p>

<p><said>Rather a good thing, I should say.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh you don't know, you don't know. If you did——</said></p>

<p><said>Well, if I did, what then?</said></p>

<p>He looked into her eyes and saw trouble written
there.</p>

<p><said>You see,</said> she went on in low, plaintive tones, <said>it
was all my fault. I persuaded Quamina to come to
England with me. We were to visit vengeance on
Simon Halstead, as I told you. Quamina by himself
would never have thought of doing what I talked him
into, and, if he <emph>had</emph> thought, he couldn't have carried
it out. How could he? So I'm responsible, and—and
now he's gone to——</said></p>

<p>She shuddered and turned her head away.</p>

<p><said>You mean that he's gone off on his own account
to do what was in your mind when you brought him to
England?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, that's what's frightening me. Since I've known
you I've changed. I can't explain why. Angry words
have passed of late between me and Quamina. He
thinks of nothing but blood—but he's only a poor
savage. You mustn't be hard on him. He dislikes you
because he's certain that it's you who's made me alter
my plan. Do you understand? I tried to explain
that &#x2026; murder &#x2026; could not make things better. What's
done is done, and Halstead's death can't restore to my
father what was taken from him. It can't remove
Quamina's scars. It can't make me forget the persecu-
tion he inflicted upon me because I was the daughter of
slaves.</said></p>

<p><said>Slaves? Not your father, surely?</said> cried Ralstone,
horrified.</p>

<pb n="239"/>

<p><said>Yes. My father was a man of past middle age
when he married. He was nearly seventy when he died,
and he told me that fifty years ago he was kidnapped
in Bristol, smuggled on board one of Halstead's father's
ships, and taken to Barbados and sold as a slave.
Oh, it would make your blood run cold if you knew the
terrible things done in the old days. When my father
fell in love with my mother—she was very beautiful——</said></p>

<p><said>I can well believe that,</said> interjected Ralstone.</p>

<p><said>Simon Halstead swore he would make life a hell
for him. He wanted her for himself, you see. My
father defied him, and hell came. I don't want to say
any more about this—I want to forget my wrongs.
But Quamina doesn't. He never will, and I'm sure
it's that which has taken him away. What am I to
do? Something terrible may happen. I can't prevent
it. I'm helpless.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone was silent for a few moments. He was
rapidly summing up the situation.</p>

<p><said>Does he know where the old man lives?</said> he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p><said>In a way, yes. While those wretches who had me
in their clutches were camping on the common, I heard
them talking about the gentlefolk who had estates
in the neighbourhood and which was the safest place
for poaching, and they mentioned Simon Halstead and
the woods round the Manor House. After I ran from
you I was full of horrible thoughts, and when I again
met Quamina I told him everything. In the forests of
Barbados he could track down anything he once set
his mind upon. No bloodhound has a keener scent.
He mayn't know the road to Bristol, but he'll find
it.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone did not under-estimate the danger, and he
could see but one way to counteract it. Unwilling as
he was to meet his stepfather, he must go down to the
Manor House and warn him.</p>

<p><said>You say Quamina's been gone two days. It's over
a hundred miles to Bristol. Even if he were familiar
with the road, it would take him four days at least to
<pb n="240"/>
get there. As he'd probably have to ask his way, we
might allow him a week.</said></p>

<p><said>Not so long,</said> cried Nyra. <said>He's a very fast runner.
He would sleep in the day and run in the night and
never stop. <emph>I</emph> know what he can do.</said></p>

<p><said>Very well. Let us say four days. I don't think
you've anything to fear meanwhile, so long as you keep
to the house. Promise me that.</said></p>

<p><said>Are you then going away?</said> she asked with a slight
quiver in her voice.</p>

<p><said>Yes. I must go to Bristol. I must get there before
Quamina. What else is to be done?</said></p>

<p><said>Nothing.</said></p>

<p>She seemed to speak hopelessly. Ralstone wondered
what was in her mind. They strolled on slowly, neither
speaking for some moments.</p>

<p><said>Supposing he hasn't gone there?</said> she broke out
suddenly.</p>

<p><said>That occurred to me too. I can only put Simon
on his guard and come away. I can do no more.</said></p>

<p>He felt her hand which was in his suddenly tremble.</p>

<p><said>But that will mean you'll have to tell him about
me,</said> she whispered.</p>

<p><said>Not at all. I shall have to tell him where his
danger lies of course, that is if he has the patience to
listen to me.. Perhaps he won't. One never knows
how he'll take things. Anyhow, <emph>you</emph> won't come into
the matter. You're not afraid to be left in London
alone, are you?</said></p>

<p><said>No, I'm not afraid.</said></p>

<p>But he felt her shiver all the same.</p>

<p><said>Keep a brave heart, little one,</said> he went on. <said>Just
a few days more—I've one thing left to do and then—
all the world's before us.</said></p>

<p>He spoke encouragingly, but it was an effort. He
had the duel with Tenbury on his mind. Despite his
belief in his luck it might come off with him rather
badly. If he could only be sure that Nyra was com-
pletely out of the man's reach he would not mind so
much. But he could devise no plan without <choice><corr>enlighten</corr><orig>enligten</orig></choice>-
ing her, and this he would not do. He did not even
<pb n="241"/>
allude to his fight with Jerry Winch, and he blessed the
dark night that prevented her seeing the strapping on
his right cheek.</p>

<p>They wandered back to the Middlesex side of the
bridge, the old woman whom neither had seen following
them stealthily. He saw her to the house in King Street
and was loth to leave her, but he purposed catching the
night coach for Bristol, which started from the <q>White
Horse Cellar,</q> Piccadilly, a little before twelve.</p>

<p>Then came the last adieu. Just a few endearing
words. He hardly knew what he said. For a moment
she clung to him as though impelled to the embrace by
every nerve in her body. He left her with a heavy
heart, and with the picture in his memory of her pale
face and tearful eyes.</p>

<p>He was far too absorbed to notice the old woman
crouching in a doorway opposite, and jumping into a
coach he hastened to Tom Spring's to explain that he
was called away to the West of England on important
business, and was at the <q>White Horse Cellar</q> a little
before eleven and booked the only vacant seat that
was left. By midnight the coach, to the admiration of
the crowd who nightly assembled to see the sight, was
making a brave show along Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Ralstone reckoned that he would be at the Manor
House about noon of the following day, but on the
Bath Road, some sixty miles from London, one of the
leaders went lame; it was a couple of hours before
another horse could be procured, and he proved to be
a jibber. It was night before Bath was left behind
and the coach speeding on its way to Bristol along the
road ever associated with Nyra, for it was here that
he had his memorable ride with her arms enclosing him.
He seemed to feel their warmth and pressure even now.</p>

<p>The coach put him down at the nearest point to
the Manor House. He had about a couple of miles to
walk along a road lonely at any time, but doubly so at
the dead of night. Part of the way was between a
pine plantation on either side, but the spot was familiar
to him and he had no longer the feeling of desolation
which overtook him after he had alighted, and the
<pb n="242"/>
grinding of the coach and the rattle of the horses' hoofs
were becoming fainter and fainter.</p>

<p>The smell of the soil, the scent of the pines and
bracken, even the peculiar stagnant odour from the ~
big pond where he had ofttimes caught carp and tench
brought back his boyhood. The distinctive smell of
London, with its unswept streets and festering gutters,
was that of foulness. It was akin to life as he had
found it in the metropolis—that life which he once
thought meant the height of pleasure—Tenbury, Weare,
Thurtell, Vicary, Jerry Winch, all types of degradation,
greed and brutality. Even poor Lady Barbara repre-
sented nothing but frivolous artificiality, selfishness and
vanity. The one bright ray amid the blackness was
Nyra.</p>

<p>He was inclined to except boxing—at least, so far
as the fighters themselves were concerned. They bore
themselves like men. The majority exhibited a certain
amount of chivalry, and there was rarely any malice.
A few cases where a <soCalled>cross</soCalled> might be suspected could
have been cited, but there were not nearly so many as
in modern times when big stakes became the fashion.
But of the hangers-on, the dregs, most of whom would
hardly face a fist, the less said the better.</p>

<p>He was pondering all this when through a clearing in
the plantations he saw, to his surprise, a light in the
window of a house which he knew well enough. Was
the squire drinking himself to sleep after his old fashion?
If so, what kind of reception would he have?</p>

<p>Ralstone stopped, his eyes fixed on the window.
The onerous nature of his task, now that it was so near,
presented itself vividly. He thought of that truculent,
tyrannical old man and of Nyra's story of his terrible
cruelty. At that moment a shadowy form passed
rapidly between him and the light and vanished. Ral-
stone instantly thought of Quamina and rushed forward.
His foot caught a gnarled tree root and he pitched down
headlong. He picked himself up, more angry than
hurt. All chance of pursuing the negro—if it were he
—was gone. He went on to the Manor House wondering
if any of the servants were about.</p>

<pb n="243"/>

<p>He was beneath the porch, and deciding that the bell
would make too much noise, knocked softly. No one
came, and he went round to the back of the house.
Stephen slept over the stables, and picking up a stone
he flung it against the window. Presently the sash was
flung up.</p>

<p><said>Who be that?</said> growled the coachman. <said>Anything
more happened?</said></p>

<p><said>It's I, Stephen—Jack Ralstone. Come down. I
want to speak to you.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm domned! If this bean't like the finger o'
Providence. I'll be wi' 'ee in two twos.</said></p>

<p>The door opened. Stephen, half dressed and shaking
like a leaf, confronted him.</p>

<p><said>'Ee must ha' knowed what be a happenin' to bring
'ee 'ere now,</said> he stammered in his shrill, quavering
voice.</p>

<p><said>What <emph>has</emph> happened? I know nothing.</said></p>

<p><said>T' old squire be a lyin' stark dead. Tummas found
him stiff in his chair an' black in the face. I saddled
Black Ivory an' rode post haste to Bristol for the doctor,
but it warn't no good. Doctor said he'd had a apple-
plectoic fit, an' had been dead 'arf an hour afore
Tummas commed in the room.</said></p>

<p>Something like a feeling of relief went over Ralstone.
All his worry and trouble about Nyra and Quamina had
come to an end.</p>

<p><said>When did it occur?</said> he asked.</p>

<p><said>Nigh upon three o'clock this afternoon. Squire ate
a 'earty dinner—he were al'ays a good trencherman,
drunk or sober, mostly drunk, I'm bound to say, and
he were left asleep and a snorin' peacefully. We never
disturb him when he's nappin', an' it were only 'cause
Tummas couldn't hear him a sendin' his pigs to market
as the lad went in, knowin' as he had appinted to meet
Lawyer Knowles at his office. It was then as Tummas
came runnin' out a cryin' as the master was dead an'
gone.</said></p>

<p><said>I saw a light in his room. Is he there?</said></p>

<p><said>Aye. We took him an' laid him on the big bed.
Will 'ee go an' see him? I'll knock Tummas up.
<pb n="244"/>
There bean't no one else in the house. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Coombes,
the cook, were too frightened to stay, and all the maids
they be gone weeks an' weeks. The Squire he ha' been
awful queer in his ways, and they took an' left. He
were like one possessed of a devil at times, an' at others
you'd ha' thought as he'd done a murder or summat
dreadful and was haunted. I dunno what comed to
him o' late, unless it were you a goin' away.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone understood but, of course, did not enlighten
Stephen. He decided to see the dead squire at once,
and Stephen, after some difficulty, <choice><corr>succeeded</corr><orig>succeded</orig></choice> in rousing
Thomas.</p>

<p>Soon Ralstone was in the death chamber, which
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Coombes, with a proper regard for etiquette on
such occasions, had made decent and in order. With
feelings which he did not take the trouble to analyse,
even had analysis been possible, the young man looked
upon the face of his stepfather. Death, in its merciful
fashion, had softened the repulsive lines and lessened
the coarseness of the old man's features, but there was
enough indication left of his evil life and of his animal-
ism to tell its own story.</p>

<p><said>You'll want a rest, Master Jack,</said> said Stephen,
who had accompanied Ralstone. <said>I dunno where to
put 'ee. Most o' the beds'll be damp wi' no maids to
see to 'em. There's only the little room <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Coombes
used to have. It be along that passage. A bit near
the Squire's, but I don't see as there be ought to fear
in a dead body.</said></p>

<p><said>Of course there isn't The little room will do well
enough. I'm dead beat.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone had only been able to doze during the long
coach ride, and as he had an outside seat his sleep
didn't amount to much.</p>

<p>Stephen attended him, candle in hand, and shuffled
away to his own quarters. Ralstone was too fatigued
to undress. He threw himself on the bed and had
hardly laid his head on the pillow than he dropped
into a heavy sleep. But not for long. He was over-
wrought and his nerves and brain refused to become
normal at once. He had not slumbered for ten minutes
<pb n="245"/>
when he found himself wide awake, but with no clear
idea where he was or of what had happened.</p>

<p>Slowly consciousness struggled back. He found him-
self sitting up, but had no remembrance of having
raised his body. The silence was broken by a cracking
sound. He could not determine whether he really heard
anything or that it was the fag-end of a dream. He
listened. It came again. It was not from anything in
his room, but outside the house, a short distance away.
He could see nothing. Then he went into the passage.
He could distinctly hear footsteps. They were in
Simon Halstead's room. He strode softly to the door
and opened it.</p>

<p>Quamina, knife in hand, was standing at the foot
of the bed, glaring at the dead man. He was so motion-
less he might have been black marble. Evidently he
had not heard Ralstone enter.</p>

<p><said>Quamina,</said> said Ralstone, <said>what are you doing
here?</said></p>

<p>The negro started. He fixed his gleaming eyes on
Jack.</p>

<p><said>Him dead, massa?</said> he growled in guttural tones.</p>

<p><said>Yes. You're too late. Put that knife away. Go
back to your mistress. She needs you. Why did
you leave her?</said></p>

<p>Ralstone purposely spoke without the slightest
suggestion of rancour or harshness. He reckoned upon
the negro's savage instincts being appeased by the
sight of his hated enemy lying dead, and that his sense
of rough justice was satisfied.</p>

<p>Jack was right, but he was not prepared for Quamina
throwing himself at his feet and pouring out a torrent
of words in his native tongue, mingled with a few ex-
pressions in broken English. These expressions gave
the clue to his attitude. He thought that Halstead had
been slain by Ralstone. This was enough to banish
his jealousy and ensure his gratitude. Ralstone did
not undeceive him. What did it matter so long as a
threatened tragedy had been averted?</p>

<p><said>You must return to Nyra at once,</said> said he.</p>

<p>The negro rose submissively enough and was going
<pb n="246"/>
towards the window, one pane of which was broken.
It was by this window he had entered, breaking the
glass and slipping back the catch by putting his hand
through the hole. It was easy enough for so active a
fellow to haul himself up with the assistance of the
stout wisteria which covered half the front of the house.</p>

<p><said>No, no, not that way,</said> commanded Ralstone.
<said>I'll show you an easier road.</said></p>

<p>Quamina did not attempt to question Ralstone's
word, but followed like a dog. On the way down it
occurred to Jack that he would send a line to Nyra,
telling her the all-important news and begging her to be
of good courage until his return. He took the negro
into the dining-room, found pens, ink and paper, and
scribbled his note.</p>

<p><said>That's for your mistress. Don't lose it. Get it
to her as soon as you can.</said></p>

<p>Quamina nodded, stuck the note within the folds of
the gay bandana handkerchief he wore like a girdle
round his waist, and departed. When Ralstone
returned to his bed he slept like a top.</p>

</div>


<div n="25" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="25">XXV</num></head>
<head type="main">Nemesis!</head>

<p>It was clear to Ralstone that he would have to stay
at the Manor House a couple of days or so. There was
no one but he to see after the funeral. He could do no
good by returning to Nyra. Quamina, by the speed
with which he travelled, would, in all probability, get
to London quicker than he could by the mail coach.
The negro would be so eager to tell his mistress what
had happened that he would not waste a minute.</p>

<p>The next morning the lawyer from Bristol came.
Stephen, the previous night, had taken him the
news.</p>

<p><said>You'd better look over all papers and take charge
of them. I know nothing of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Halstead's affairs.</said></p>

<p><said>You ought to know,</said> returned the lawyer with a
<pb n="247"/>
queer smile. <said>You're the person most concerned.</said></p>

<p><said>How so?</said></p>

<p><said>Because you've inherited everything. By a will
executed a year ago <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Halstead made you sole heir.
Whether he intended any alteration by writing that he
would see me yesterday, I can't say. He was always
sending me notes about his will and countermanding his
instructions the next day. I suppose he acted accord-
ing to his mood—never the same for long. That's my
reading of it, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralstone. Anyway, you're a rich
man and I congratulate you.</said></p>

<p>Jack at first was staggered. The news seemed too
good to be true. He had no objection to being rich,
but what gave him the most pleasure was that he could
repay every farthing of the money, and more, of which
Simon had robbed Nyra's father.</p>

<p>The story that Squire Halstead had been found dead
was speedily in everybody's mouth, and three days later
Holbrook village church, where the funeral service was
held, was filled with the villagers and many of the
gentry round about. Jack Ralstone, the cricketer,
sportsman, and all-round athlete, had hosts of friends
and was welcome wherever he went.</p>

<p>The funeral was over; Ralstone, after thanking those
whom he knew personally for their presence, was about
to return to the Manor House, intending to take the
Bristol mail that night for London, when he caught
sight of Sir Phineas Tenbury. Tenbury was in the
shade of an old cypress, leaning against the trunk. A
sneer hovered about his lips, and his eyes, their baggy
lids drooping, were fixed superciliously on Ralstone.
For a moment or two the latter was taken aback. So
much had happened during the last few days he had
almost forgotten his enemy.</p>

<p>Sir Phineas was apparently expecting him to make
the first move, but Ralstone ignored him, whereupon
the baronet advanced, raising his hat with elaborate
politeness. Ralstone made no sign, but simply awaited
him.</p>

<p><said>May I add my congratulations to those of your
<pb n="248"/>
friends?</said> said Sir Phineas in a tone of studied smooth-
ness.</p>

<p><said>You may do what you please. I presume that I
don't owe your intrusion here to that intention.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, hardly. Perhaps you'd like to know <emph>why</emph>
I've intruded, as you're pleased to put it.</said></p>

<p>His silky urbanity irritated Ralstone intensely, but
as probably this was Tenbury's purpose, he kept his
temper.</p>

<p><said>Sir Phineas Tenbury is versed in the etiquette of
affairs of honour. He ought to know that the princi-
pals, before meeting on the field, don't approach each
other save through their seconds. Lord Walsham will
be happy to listen to any communication you may give
to Captain Charteris.</said></p>

<p><said>Suppose we drop etiquette, my dear Ralstone.
I've fulfilled my obligations and I owe you nothing.
Why should we not finish the affair without further
delay? Our quarrel is not a mere fashionable exchange
of shots.</said></p>

<p><said>I quite agree. I don't intend it should be.</said></p>

<p><said>Then why talk of seconds? Why not settle the
thing quietly between ourselves—unless, of course,
you're afraid——</said></p>

<p><said>Afraid, Sir Phineas? Of you?</said></p>

<p>Ralstone threw an infinitude of contempt into his
words. Tenbury's lips whitened.</p>

<p><said>Oh, I know you can use your hands, but when
hands are holding pistols it's a different matter.</said></p>

<p><said>It's all the same to me. Why don't you come to
the point? What do you propose?</said></p>

<p><said>Thanks for the question. The answer's ready.
If you're agreeable we might decide the affair to-night
at my place. It's but twelve miles or so from here, an
easy ride for your black nag. I believe <choice><corr>you've</corr><orig>you're</orig></choice> ridden
the Bath Road before now.</said></p>

<p>Tenbury's manner had become intolerably insulting,
though he had not raised his voice nor dropped its
oiliness.</p>

<p><said>I've heard you possess some kind of shed not far
away. I've no doubt it's good enough for the purpose.
<pb n="249"/>
You're the challenged party and have the choice
weapons. Swords or <choice><corr>pistols</corr><orig>postols</orig></choice>?</said></p>

<p><said>Pistols would probably suit you. It would be
fairer. I understand you've lately exercised your
muscles somewhat in the prize ring. You'd be hardly
in a condition to handle a blade.</said></p>

<p><said>Pray don't consider me. As you've evidently
thought out the arrangements, perhaps you've brought
the weapons. Had I known I should have the pleasure
of meeting you to-day, I should have been prepared.
My duelling pistols are in London.</said></p>

<p><said>So I anticipated. Mine are at your service. You
can take your choice. I believe they are in excellent
order.</said></p>

<p><said>No doubt. What time will be most convenient to
you?</said></p>

<p><said>Twelve o'clock, if equally agreeable to yourself.
We're not likely to be interrupted at that hour.</said></p>

<p><said>I am your servant, sir.</said></p>

<p>And without another word Ralstone, after raising
his hat, not to be outdone in the farce of politeness by
his adversary, turned on his heel.</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p><said>You know the way to Sir Phineas Tenbury's place,
Stephen?</said></p>

<p><said>The Den? Course I does, Master Jack. It won't
be the barrownite's long. He'll have to give it up to
the mortgagees, I'm told.</said></p>

<p>Tenbury's temporal affairs did not interest Ralstone,
and he rode on in silence, Stephen keeping alongside,
but just half a length or so in the rear. It was about
half-past eleven when they reached the by-road leading
to the Den. It was a hot night and the close air, the
solitude and the stillness were oppressive.</p>

<p><said>Here we are, sir,</said> said Stephen suddenly, and drew
rein at the broken lodge gates. <said>D'ye see yon light?
That's the place.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone dismounted.</p>

<p><said>I'll walk to the house,</said> said he. <said>Wait here with
the horses. If I don't come back you'll take these two
letters to whom they are addressed.</said></p>

<pb n="250"/>

<p>One was for Lawyer Knowles of Bristol, the other for
Nyra at King Street, Covent Garden.</p>

<p><said>If 'ee don't come back, sir,</said> Stephen was beginning,
when Jack stopped him peremptorily and strode on.
Stephen was aghast, but there was something in his
young master's manner which prevented him asking
questions.</p>

<p>Ralstone pushed his way amid the tangle of growth
to the cottage and rapped at the door with his riding
whip. He heard a bolt shot back and Sir Phineas stood
in the doorway.</p>

<p><said>You're punctual,</said> was all that the baronet said.
He pointed along the passage and Ralstone followed
him.</p>

<p><said>I apologise for asking you to fight in the kitchen,
but it is the largest room in the place,</said> said he when
they were in the brick-paved apartment.</p>

<p>The kitchen was almost bare of furniture. A rough
deal table was at one side and on it were a couple of
tallow candles and a square, flat mahogany box. A
grandfather's clock ticked solemnly next the big fire-
place. It pointed to a quarter to twelve. Not a word
was said on either side until Sir Phineas opened the
mahogany box. It contained a couple of duelling
pistols.</p>

<p><said>I give you your choice,</said> he went on. <said>I think
you'll find them to your liking. They're Joe Manton's
best.</said></p>

<p>Ralstone nodded. He felt in a strange quiescent
mood. So far as his sensations guided him, his pulses
were beating as evenly and as regularly as the ticking
of the old clock. Nothing seemed to be of the least
consequence. He was in the hands of fate. He took
the pistol nearest him and looked at it as a matter of
form. In reality he was perfectly indifferent.</p>

<p><said>As we've no one to drop the handkerchief, I had
to think of another way of signalling. I suggest we
wait until the clock begins to strike twelve and at the
final stroke both fire. Is that agreeable?</said> continued
Sir Phineas.</p>

<pb n="251"/>

<p><said>As you please,</said> rejoined Ralstone, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>

<p>The room was about twenty feet by fifteen and the
positions were fixed at its longest length. Some eighteen
feet separated the two men, and good shots as they
were they could hardly miss. The candles lighted them
equally.</p>

<p>The preliminaries occupied nearly ten minutes, and
each in his place awaited the clang of the clock. They
stood sideways, their pistol arms hanging down. Their
demeanour towards each other had all through been
absolutely correct. There was not the slightest sign
that each was thirsting for the other's blood. Ralstone
found himself wondering why he was so calm. To him
the whole thing was a dream—a piece of acting. It
was quite unreal.</p>

<p>Suddenly he started. Every nerve in his body
quivered. The clock had commenced to chime. Had
it been the signal to fire his hand would have been so
unsteady he must have missed his aim. But there was
yet time to recover himself. All at once he heard
Tenbury's voice—harsh, rasping, metallic.</p>

<p><said>Perhaps you'd like to know that whatever happens,</said>
he was saying, <said>Nyra is mine—mine at this very
moment.</said></p>

<p><said>You lie,</said> Ralstone retorted.</p>

<p>It dawned upon him that the singular method Ten-
bury had adopted for their final meeting was intended
to unsteady him—that his present boast had the same
object. If so, it had failed. The words acted upon
Ralstone both as a tonic and a stimulant. All his
momentary loss of control was gone. The one thought
—the one desire was to see the boaster dead at his feet.
Sir Phineas grinned at Ralstone's defiance, and a
hideous grin it was, the white lips stretched tightly over
the teeth.</p>

<p><said>So you think. You're wrong. Nyra is in my safe
keeping, thanks to the wily old hag who saw you and
the girl on Waterloo Bridge, cooing like turtle doves—
who followed you both to King Street—who enticed her
<pb n="252"/>
out of the house and caged the pretty bird. She has
now no young Lochinvar to gallop away with her.</said></p>

<p>The clock had ceased to chime. Its striking had
begun. Sir Phineas went on jeering between the strokes.
Ralstone never heeded him. Nothing mattered now
but death. Three more clangs and all would be over.</p>

<p>Ten—eleven—Sir Phineas swiftly raised his pistol,
his finger on the trigger. He had treacherously antici-
pated the signal and was taking careful aim, when
the door was burst open and a girl, her hair dishevelled,
her feet bare, rushed in. A report—a scream—a second
report—the fall of a heavy body—the sonorous note of
the twelfth stroke. Then &#x2026; Nyra, the blood streaming
from a wound in her shoulder, was in Ralstone's arms,
and Sir Phineas was lying dead on the hearthstone, a
bullet through his brain.</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>Sir Phineas had spoken the truth. Sally Winch faith-
fully fulfilled her mission. Nyra, once in her clutches,
had been conveyed to the Den, and her possession was
to be the crowning triumph after he had disposed of his
rival. But this part of his infamy had led to his un-
doing. Escaping from her prison in an upper room,
she had entered the kitchen at the critical moment and
had not only disturbed Tenbury's aim, but had received
the bullet—happily a flesh wound only—intended for
Jack Ralstone. It was one of those coincidences of
which life is full, and for which there is no accounting,
for she was wholly in ignorance of the duel and that
her lover was facing death.</p>

<p>Nemesis had indeed overtaken Sir Phineas. It
followed even the four thousand pounds, the <choice><corr>proceeds</corr><orig>procceds</orig></choice>
of the pearls, of which he had so basely robbed Lady
Barbara. The money did nobody any good. Ralstone
would have nothing to do with it, and he sent the
cheque back to Fauntleroy's bank on which it was
drawn. Within a few months it went into the pit of
the liabilities which the forger, Henry Fauntleroy, dug
for himself and his deluded depositors.</p>

<p>The law, of course, had to take note of the baronet's
<pb n="253"/>
death, but when the story of his infamy was made
known Jack Ralstone became the hero of the hour.
On the day of his trial—as a necessary formality he
had to answer the charge of manslaughter—the Court
of the Old Bailey was crowded by his fellow Corin-
thians, together with a goodly sprinkling of P.R. men
marshalled by Spring, and when Corinthian Jack
stepped from the dock a free man a cheer went up that
scandalised the Recorder and the Bench of Aldermen.
The Corinthians would have celebrated the occasion
by a fistic display at the Fives Court but Jack shook
his head.</p>

<p><said>No, no,</said> he cried. <said>I've a much more important
thing to think about. I'm going to be married and
you must all come to the wedding!</said></p>

<p>That wedding was a merry time and no one added
more to the mirth than did Quamina, whose rolling
black eyes and gleaming teeth were everywhere in
evidence to show his joy at the triumph of his mistress
and his gratitude to her husband.</p>

<p>The years rolled on, but amid their happiness Jack
and Nyra could not forget their old days of peril.
Rarely did they visit London but they wandered over
the bridge, ever dear to them as the scene of their first
exchange of confidences, and of the dawning of a love
which, beginning in shadow, ended in sunshine.</p>
