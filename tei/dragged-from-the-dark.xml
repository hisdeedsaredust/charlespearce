<head type="main">A Terrible Discovery</head>

<p>On Thursday morning, the 27th of May, 1857, five
women entered the Police Station at Hammersmith
and asked to see the inspector. On the latter pre-
senting himself they said that for two days nothing
had been seen of their neighbour, a <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett,
who lived by herself in a little cottage in Water Lane,
a somewhat unfrequented thoroughfare about ten
minutes' walk from the river. They had knocked
several times, but could obtain no response. The
windows were fastened, and the blinds closely drawn,
so that it was impossible to obtain even a glimpse of
the interior. The silence had at last alarmed them;
and, fearing a crime, or, at least, an accident, they
had determined to come to the station to ask that a
policeman might be sent to force the door. Now,
Hammersmith is—or was twenty years ago—one of
the quietest suburbs of the Metropolis, and, beyond
an occasional robbery, the police rarely had much to
occupy their attention. The inspector at first snub-
bed the women, and evidently treated their story
with contempt, and it was only after they had per-
severed that he acceded to their demand. He
accordingly sent a sergeant and two men with the
necessary tools for forcing the lock.</p>

<p>Water Lane was not more than a quarter of an
hour's walk from the police station, and the little
party, with the sergeant at their head, soon arrived
at Ivy Cottage, not a very aristocratic mansion, but
such a house as one might suppose a fairly well-to-do
tradesman retired from business might choose for his
residence. It stood within a tolerably large piece of
ground, well stocked with flowers and vegetables, and
was protected by a high brick wall, which enclosed
the whole of the garden, the entrance to the latter
being through a light wooden gate.</p>

<p><q>This is the house,</q> said the foremost of the
women.</p>

<p>The sergeant stopped. During their progress the
little crowd had become considerably augmented, and
now there were at least twenty or thirty curious
spectators, all eager to solve the mystery which had
brought the police to Ivy Cottage.</p>

<p><q>Ryan,</q> said Sergeant Scott to one of the men,
<q>stop here, and let no one enter the garden</q>; and
then, pushing open the little garden gate, he walked
up the narrow path, followed by the other policeman,
and knocked loudly at the door. After each stroke
he placed his ear to the panel of the door and listened,
but there was not a sound, and after a while he bade
a policeman break open the door. The latter had just
begun the process of forcing the lock when a commo-
tion arose in the little crowd outside the gate.</p>

<p><q>The key,</q> cried someone, <q>here's the key</q>; and,
in fact, a boy twelve years or so had, in kicking his
feet among the grass and weeds that grew on the edge
of a ditch at the side of the path, stumbled across a
large key, which he now held up in triumph.</p>

<p><q>Hand it over, boy,</q> said <abbr>P.C.</abbr> Ryan.</p>

<p>The key was tried. It fitted the keyhole exactly,
and, on being turned, opened the door easily. The
sergeant and his man exchanged a meaning glance.</p>

<p><q>Looks bad, sir,</q> said the latter.</p>

<p>As they entered the house the crowd could no longer
restrain their impatience, but stretched their necks
over the gate, pushed each other to and fro, and two
or three, greatly to the indignation of the policeman,
contrived to climb the wall and perch themselves on
the top.</p>

<p>On going into the room at the right hand side of
the passage the officers saw at once that those who
suspected a crime had been committed were, un-
happily, not deceived. Everything in the room
announced, with ghastly eloquence, the presence of a
murder. The light, dim and gloomy as it was, shewed
the apartment in a state of disorder, a cheffioneer
in one corner having evidently been broken open, and
various articles strewn about the floor. At the ex-
treme end of the room was a door leading to a second
apartment evidently used as a bedroom, and here the
disorder was even greater. Indeed, had anyone taken
the whole of the contents and thrown them indis-
criminately about, it could not have been worse. The
two men had not to look for the missing woman, for
there, in the outer room, near the fireplace, her face in
the ashes, was stretched the corpse of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett.
She was but half dressed, and her hair on one side,
where the hot cinders had fallen upon it, was slightly
burnt; and, indeed, so near had she fallen to the fire,
that it was a miracle her clothes had not caught.</p>

<p><q>Hang it!</q> growled the sergeant, <q>the scoundrels,
if they did want to rob the poor woman they might
have spared her life.</q></p>

<p>He stooped over the body, and began to examine it.</p>

<p><q>Where has she been struck?</q> asked the policeman;
<q>I don't see no blood about nowhere.</q></p>

<p><q>Just here, behind the shoulders,</q> replied the ser-
geant, pointing to a horribly significant red spot just
above the bodice. <q>One stroke and it was all over.
I don't suppose she should have had time even to
scream. Bled internally I expect. They're always
the worst wounds.</q></p>

<p>As he spoke he knelt down by the corpse, and
placed his hand on the shoulder. The flesh was icy
cold.</p>

<p><q>She wasn't stabbed yesterday, I'll swear. Been
dead at least thirty-six hours,</q> he said, as he took out
his notebook and pencil. His memorandum was
made, and, having left two policemen in charge of the
house, he returned with the startling intelligence to
the station, and the necessary information was con-
veyed to the coroner for the holding of an inquest.</p>

<p><q>Who was <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett? Where did she come
from? How did she live? What were her habits?
Had she any relations, friends, acquaintances? Was
she a miser? Was she believed to be rich? To what
end was the inquiry to be directed?</q></p>

<p>The witnesses were certainly numerous enough, but
when all the evidence which could be scraped together
was taken it did not amount to very much. The
testimony of the neighbours was incomplete, inco-
herent, and wide of the mark. Nobody really knew
anything of the murdered woman, for she was a
stranger to the neighbourhood. Out of the multitude
of persons who came forward, anxious to give some
kind of what they believed to be evidence of vital
importance, only two, a jobbing gardener who had
been in the habit of working for her—for the deceased
had a passion for flowers—and a milk-woman who
supplied her with milk morning and evening, gave
anything like precise information. After some hours
of tedious questioning, after reconciling all the con-
tradictory statements, after sifting every absurd conjec-
ture, all that could be definitely settled was the
following:—Two years before, in the beginning of the
year '55, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett called upon a house agent in
the neighbourhood, and after going over several houses
he had to let, finally fixed upon Ivy Cottage. She
appeared to have plenty of money, did not scruple
about the rent, and even paid a quarter in advance.
Her furniture was brought by an ordinary green-
grocer's van, and though not costly or modern, was
good of its kind. As she did not appear to have told
anyone where she came from, no information was
forthcoming on this point. Her age was apparently
about 54 or 55. She was well preserved, strong, and
in good health. No one could throw any light upon
her choosing as a place of residence the neighbourhood
of Hammersmith, where she had not absolutely a
single acquaintance. Her dresses, though plain, were
well made, and to a certain extent she followed the
fashion, wore gay ribbons in her bonnets, and was
occasionally seen with jewellery. She was of a cheer-
ful disposition, and, excepting that she said little
about herself, was always ready for conversation.
The only point noticeable—and this was marked by
several witnesses—was that she was fond of talking
about ships and the sea, and the inference was that if
she was not a native of some town on the sea coast,
she had, at all events, lived near it at some period of
her life. About her family she did not care much to
talk, and of her husband, who had been lost, she had
been heard to say, in a storm at sea, she very rarely
spoke. Once only she had said to the milkman,
<q>There never was a more unlucky woman than I in
marriage;</q> and on another occasion, <q>It's all very
well, but my husband only loved me a year.</q> She
was thought by the tradespeople to be rich, or, at
least, in easy circumstances. She had subscribed
liberally to the building of a new church, and had
assisted privately one or two people who were dis-
tressed, and always purchased coal and bread tickets
in the winter. She liked to live well, and was fond of
company; and when someone insinuated that she was
well off, she did not directly give a contradiction.
Indeed, she had been heard to say, <q>I'm not exactly
a millionaire, but I have as much as I want; if I
wanted more I could get it.</q> But in all she had
never been betrayed in any allusion to her past his-
tory, her native place, or her family. She had seen
something of the world, and easily baffled any attempt
made to pry into her personal affairs. She rarely
went out in the evening, and generally slept awhile
after dinner. Seldom had strangers been seen in
Ivy Cottage—four or five times a lady and a young
man, and on one occasion an elderly aristocratic
gentleman, the latter riding in an elegantly-appointed
chariot. She usually kept a servant, but at the time
the murder was committed was without one.</p>

<p>This meagre collection of facts was all that the in-
quest was able to establish; the rest remained to be
discovered by the police. We shall see how they
failed or succeeded in their task.</p>

<head type="num">Chapter II</head>
<head type="main">At Scotland Yard</head>

<p>One of the most experienced and astute of the Scot-
land Yard detectives of that day was a man to whom,
for the purposes of this story, we may give the name
of Forrest. Undoubtedly an able man in his profes-
sion, but apt to be blinded by his obstinacy. If he
came to a wrong conclusion, he could hardly bring
himself to own it, still less could he retrace any false
step. Full of audacity and coolness, it was scarcely
possible to disconcert him, and, being possessed of
<choice><corr>herculean</corr><orig>hurculean</orig></choice> strength, he was never afraid to grapple
with any prisoner, no matter how powerful in the
way of thews and sinews; but his special gift, his
glory, and his triumph, was his extraordinary memory
of faces. Let him but see a person's countenance for
five minutes, and the features were burnt indelibly
into his brain. No matter the surrounding, no matter
the time and place, no matter the disguise, his hawk's
eye penetrated the veil of deceit, and triumphantly
detected the reality beneath. To Forrest the care of
the Hammersmith tragedy was committed, and he at
once visited Ivy Cottage and diligently prosecuted his
inquiries. Sergeant Scott had made a note of the
evidence he had been able to collect, and this, of
course, was handed to the detective. He read it
carefully, and expressed his approval.</p>

<p><q>There is one thing though, sergeant, which you
seem to have omitted,</q> said he.</p>

<p><q>What is that?</q></p>

<p><q>The day and hour when the woman was last seen
alive.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, I've not forgotten that. She was seen on the
evening of the Tuesday previous to the discovery, at
twenty minutes to five. She then returned from
Chelsea, carrying a small basket.</q></p>

<p><q>You are quite sure about the hour?</q> asked For-
rest.</p>

<p><q>Quite. Two witnesses who rode with her in the
same omnibus, and who got out at the same time,
have fixed it beyond a doubt. Not only this, if I am
not mistaken—ah, here is a memorandum to this
effect—they had some conversation, and left her at
her own door.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you know what the basket contained?</q></p>

<p><q>No, the woman could not tell me. All they knew
was that she had a bottle of wine and another, ap-
parently, of brandy. She complained of a headache,
and said that directly she got in doors she should go
to bed.</q></p>

<p>Provided with this information, Forrest proceeded
to Ivy Cottage, in company with Scott, and minutely
inspected the first or larger room. After pursuing
his work silently for some minutes, he said suddenly
to the sergeant, <q>Did not the weather change on
Tuesday? It was fine all day, and in the evening
turned out wet. What time did the rain begin here?</q></p>

<p>The sergeant thought for a moment. <q>Half-past
nine,</q> he replied, at length. <q>I was going my rounds,
and I noticed the clock chiming when I took out my
cape and unrolled it. It came on to rain very sud-
denly, for in less then ten minutes puddles were in
the road.</q></p>

<p><q>Good,</q> remarked Forrest; <q>then it is plain if the
fellow came here after half-past nine, he must have
had muddy boots. The ground, you see, is muddy,
and there should be some foot-prints. Have you
searched for any?</q></p>

<p>The sergeant replied in the negative.</p>

<p><q>Ah,</q> returned the detective, in a tone of vexa-
tion, <q>that is a pity.</q></p>

<p><q>Stop a moment,</q> suddenly exclaimed Scott,
<q>there is yet time to see. Everything remains ex-
actly as it was; we have touched nothing, and you
will easily be able to tell my footsteps and those of
my man—they are none of the smallest.</q></p>

<p>They commenced with the bed-room. In the mid-
dle of the apartment was a dressing-table, covered
with a toilet cloth white as snow; on the left hand
side stood an old-fashioned four-post bedstead; the
sheets and blankets were tumbled into a heap, and
the pillows and bolsters were in an arm chair at the
side; a feather bed, and even the mattress beneath,
had been half removed and were hanging over the
edge of the bedstead. Forrest anxiously searched the
carpet and the clothes strewn about for the sign of a
foot-print, but not one could he see.</p>

<p><q>Ah,</q> he muttered to himself, <q>he must have
come before half-past nine. Well, that is one point
settled.</q> But, to make the matter more certain, he
continued the search in an outer room. Here a table
was spread as if for a meal. There was a glass
tumbler standing by the side of a china plate and a
knife and fork. Near the tumbler was a bottle of
wine just opened, and a bottle of brandy, from which
perhaps a couple of glasses had been taken. On one
side of the fireplace was a cupboard, the door of which
was wide open, containing glass and china, and on the
other an old escritoire, which had been forced and
doubtless ransacked in every cranny. The lid hung
by a single hinge; the drawers had been pulled out
and thrown on the ground. The detective walked
across the room to the corpse of the murdered wo-
man, and knelt beside it.</p>

<p><q>One can't say the job hasn't been well done,</q> he
muttered. <q>The fellow was no apprentice at his
work.</q></p>

<p>Then, looking right and left, continued, <q>Look
here, the poor creature was cooking when she was
struck down; here is the frying pan on the ground
with some ham and eggs in it.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah,</q> returned the sergeant, <q>it didn't take him
long to make off with the swag. Halloa! what's
this? The beggar was either a bungler or else he did
not come to steal. See here, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrest,</q> and going
up to the escritoire, the sergeant took from the top a
leather purse, in which were eight sovereigns and
some loose silver.</p>

<p><q>Humph! that's curious,</q> returned the detective,
a little disconcerted, for he had made up his mind
that robbery was the motive for the crime. <q>He
must have forgotten the purse. Perhaps he lost his
<!-- removed extra "his" -->head. I remember where a burglar committed a
murder and took to his heels without pocketing a
single thing. Besides, he may have been disturbed.
What makes me think so is that he had not left the
candle burning, but had taken the trouble to blow it
out.</q></p>

<p><q>I can't see as that proves anything,</q> rejoined the
sergeant in a slightly sarcastic tone, for he was some-
what jealous of the affected superiority of the Scot-
land Yard official; <q>he may perhaps be a careful man,
one of those who didn't like to waste anything.</q></p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1881-09-17 -->

<p>Forrest did not deign to reply, but continued his
search. However, after going through the house from
top to bottom, after ransacking every hole and corner,
and scarcely leaving a square inch unturned, he failed
to find the least trace of the murderer's presence, or
anything which would furnish a clue to his discovery.
One fact was singular, not a single scrap of paper
having writing on it was to be found anywhere. If
the widow had possessed such papers they had cer-
tainly been destroyed or carried off; and with this
scanty collection of fact the detective set off to Scot-
land Yard, there to make his report to his superior
officer.</p>

<p>For three days he diligently pursued his inquiries,
and left no stone unturned, or anything which his
experience could suggest undone, to find a trace of
the murderer; but he was baffled at every point. The
entire absence of materials to work upon fairly
paralysed him, and he owned to himself that he had
very little hope of success.</p>

<p>On reporting this failure to the Scotland Yard
superintendent, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson, the latter thought for
a moment.</p>

<p><q>I almost think, Forrest,</q> he said, <q>that you had
better have some help in the matter; it is no ordi-
nary murder, as you yourself must own.</q></p>

<p><q>That's true, sir; at the same time I don't see
what anyone can do more than I have done.</q></p>

<p>Naturally, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrest did not like being interfered
with. Should anyone succeed where he had failed, it
would be a reflection upon his reputation, and hence
he did not receive the suggestion of the superinten-
dent very favourably.</p>

<p>The superintendent read his thoughts and continued
in a conciliatory tone, <q>You see the case is so excep-
tional; and without in any way trenching upon your
ground, I should like to try what a new man, who has
been strongly recommended to me, is made of.</q></p>

<p><q>One of those private inquiry fellows, I suppose,
sir?</q> inquired Forrest, throwing himself back in his
chair with an air of dissatisfaction; <q>it seems to me
that they're ruining the regular business.</q></p>

<p><q>Perhaps so, but we need not discuss that,</q> ob-
served Superintendent Parkinson drily. <q>The ques-
tion now is the discovery of this murder, and in the
face of public opinion we are bound to make every
effort.</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly, sir,</q> replied the detective, in a tone of
ill-concealed vexation.</p>

<p><q>Very well, then, I will send at once for this man,
and you can confer together.</q></p>

<p>As he spoke, he touched a brass knob in the wall
by his side, and in a few seconds a constable appeared.
Writing a few words on a piece of notepaper, he
placed the letter in an envelope, and gave it to the
policeman. The letter was addressed to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Matthew
Kraker, 102, Hunter Street, Bloomsbury.</p>

<p><q>Take a cab, and if <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker is at home bring
him back with you,</q> said the superintendent.</p>

<p>The man saluted his superior, and went. In a little
more than half-an-hour the constable returned, but
without Matthew Kraker.</p>

<p><q>He is in the country, sir, and will not be home
till to-morrow morning at about ten.</q></p>

<p><q>That will do. He is certain to come here on his
return,</q> said the superintendent to the detective, <q>so
you be here at half-past ten.</q></p>

<p><q>Very good, sir.</q></p>

</div>


<div n="3" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter III</head>
<head type="main">A Gleam of Light</head>

<p>In the meantime, the greatest excitement had been
created, not only in Kensington, but throughout the
metropolis. The most absurd rumours were afloat,
and the ingenuity of the penny-a-liners had already
created the most astounding theories. Some of the
stories put the affair down as a mystery, certainly,
but still only as an ordinary crime committed for the
sake of robbery; and the assertion that a rough-look-
ing man in workman's dress had been seen two or
three days previous to the murder hanging about the
road lent weight to the supposition. Others, on the
contrary, hinted at a much deeper motive than that
of gain, but nothing more tangible than vaguely-
worded paragraphs had yet appeared, and for a good
reason—not a soul knew a particle more than Detec-
tive Forrest had yet discovered, and this, as we are
aware, did not amount to much. However, on the
afternoon of the day when Forrest made his report
to the superintendent, some evidence unexpectedly
turned up which seemed to promise a clue; and, in-
deed, if it were reliable, it almost appeared at first
sight as if the services of Kraker would not be necess-
ary.</p>

<p>When Forrest returned to the scene of the tragedy
on the afternoon in question, he called at the station
and found there awaiting him two persons who said
they had something to tell concerning the murder.
One of these persons was the wife of a cheesemonger,
who supplied the deceased with goods, and the other
a lad about nine years. The woman was first
examined, but her evidence did not add a great deal
to what was already known. The only item of abso-
lutely fresh intelligence was that she had heard <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Rennett speak two or three times of a son yet living.</p>

<p><q>You're sure of that, are you?</q> asked Forrest.</p>

<p><q>I'm positive of it. I remember once particularly,
because she'd had just a little too much, and stood
talking in our shop more than half-an-hour. She used
to come in frequently to gossip, especially when she
had a glass.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you know whether she used to drink?</q></p>

<p><q>She never, so to speak, got drunk; but I know
she was fond of a glass.</q></p>

<p><q>Can you remember exactly what took place on the
occasion you mention?</q></p>

<p><q>As near as I can recollect,</q> said the woman, <q>she
was leaning against the counter, near the scales, talk-
ing to a neighbour of mine who'd been fishing up the
river. I remember it very well, because she called
him a fresh water sailor. <q>My husband,</q> says she,
<q>was a real Jack-tar, and so was my son like him. If
he hadn't died with his father in China sea he'd have
been five-and-twenty this very day.</q></q></p>

<p><q>Did she ever tell you the name of this son?</q></p>

<p><q>Not on this occasion, but on another. She said
his name was James, and that she had not seen him
for many years.</q></p>

<p><q>Did she ever talk about her husband?</q></p>

<p><q>Very rarely. She once said he was very jealous
and unkind to her, and had rather a soft brain, which
made him have all kinds of strange notions.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you mean that he was mad?</q></p>

<p><q>No, I don't think she meant that. He was a
little bit touched, you know, jealous and fault-finding
without a cause, and all that.</q></p>

<p><q>I suppose she never told you how long her hus-
band and son had been dead.</q></p>

<p><q>No.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you know if her son had ever visited her at
Kensington?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't. She never told me at all events.</q></p>

<p><q>She was a pretty good customer?</q></p>

<p><q>About six shillings a week. Sometimes more,
sometimes less. She always paid ready money.</q></p>

<p>This was all the woman had to tell. The boy who
followed her was a very intelligent-looking little fel-
low, bright eyed, bold looking, and tall for his age.
He was, like most London street boys, cool and self-
possessed, and did not seem much dismayed at the
presence of the detective. He was very poorly dressed,
and was without shoes and stockings. As he subse-
quently explained, he was in no regular employment,
but passed his time in lounging about the river side,
near the mouths of the sewers, on the watch for any
treasure which was left on the mud banks. In a word,
he was a mudlark. The detective looked at him
rather superciliously, for his appearance certainly did
not hold out the hope that his information would be
of much use.</p>

<p><q>Well, sir, the other day,</q> the boy began.</p>

<p><q>What day was it?</q> interrupted the detective.</p>

<p><q>It was Sunday, I think, sir,</q> returned the mud-
lark.</p>

<p><q>And?</q></p>

<p><q>And I saw a cove near the door of Ivy Cottage.</q></p>

<p><q>At what time was this?</q></p>

<p><q>Early in the morning—'cos why? I was-a-goin'
down to the river at low water.</q></p>

<p><q>You're sure of this, are you, my kiddy?</q></p>

<p><q>Sure as ——,</q> said the boy boldly. <q>I was
agin' the cottage when I sees him a-standin' at the
door—the garden door it was.</q></p>

<p><q>What sort of a man was he?</q></p>

<p><q>Short and fat, and rather old.</q></p>

<p><q>Did he speak to you?</q></p>

<p><q>Didn't he just! He called out to me, and I goes
up to him. He says—says he, <q>you've got a good pair
of eyes,</q> and I says <q>yes,</q> says I. Then he collars
hold of my ear, and says, <q>If you can go an errand
for me quick I'll give you sixpence.</q></q></p>

<p><q>Yes, and what happened then—out with it.</q></p>

<p><q>Says I, <q>I'm your Moses,</q> and says he, <q>I wants
yer to run to Hammersmith Pier; when you gets
there you'll see a boat moored off the end near the
bridge. All you've got to do is just to tell the man
you'll see inside as I'm ready.</q> So with it he puts a
tanner into my hand, and off I goes.</q></p>

<p><q>If every witness was as sharp as this boy,</q> mut-
tered the detective, <q>we should be able to do some
good;</q> and then he added aloud, <q>Did you do what
you were told?</q></p>

<p><q>In course I did, your honour—found the boat, and
told the man.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well,</q> replied Forrest. <q>Now, if you saw
that man again, do you think you'd know him?</q></p>

<p><q>Shouldn't I just?</q> replied the mudlark, winking
desperately.</p>

<p><q>Was there anything particular about him?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, he looked very much like a sailor.</q></p>

<p><q>Is that all? Don't you know how he was dressed,
my boy? Did he have a jacket on, for instance?</q></p>

<p><q>No, it wasn't a jacket—it was one of them blue
things.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you mean a guernsey?</q></p>

<p><q>Right you are, yer honour.</q></p>

<p><q>What were his trousers like?</q></p>

<p><q>I never took no notice of his trousers.</q></p>

<p><q>Had he a hat or a cap on?</q></p>

<p>The boy thought for a moment, and then replied
that the man was wearing a cap.</p>

<p><q>Is there anything else you remember?</q> said the
detective.</p>

<p>Again the mudlark appeared to reflect deeply.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> he said at last, <q>there was summat else.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, what was it?</q></p>

<p><q>He'd got large earrings—just like a gal—blowed
if he hadn't,</q> and the boy laughed heartily, as if
tickled by the reminiscence.</p>

<p>An expression of satisfaction passed over the fea-
tures of the detective.</p>

<p><q>That will do,</q> he muttered half audibly; <q>I
shall find him.</q></p>

<p><q>Did you notice the way the boat's head was
turned?</q> he said, continuing his interrogation.</p>

<p>The boy did not seem to understand the drift of
this question.</p>

<p><q>It was tied to the pier—same as other boats,</q> he
answered.</p>

<p><q>Yes, yes,</q> exclaimed Forrest, impatiently; <q>but
was the stern—you know what a stern of a boat is—
towards Hammersmith Bridge or London Bridge?</q></p>

<p><q>Don't know, s'elp me,</q> replied the mudlark;
<q>both ends was jolly well alike.</q></p>

<p>Forrest was evidently disappointed. <q>You know
how to read?</q> he said.</p>

<p><q>Not as I ever heard on, <choice><corr>yer</corr><orig>per</orig></choice> honour.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah! then we shan't get at the name,</q> he solilo-
quized again.</p>

<p>This seemed to be about all the boy had to tell, and
he turned to take his leave.</p>

<p><q>Stop a moment, youngster,</q> said the detective, as
the boy was moving off. <q>Have you said anything
about this to anybody else?</q></p>

<p><q>Why, in course, I told my mother. 'Cos why?
I give her threepence out of the tanner.</q></p>

<p><q>Have you told me everything you know? If
you've kept anything back it'll go hard with you. I
suppose you're aware of that?</q></p>

<p>The sheepface of the young Arab of gutters flushed,
and he cast down his eyes.</p>

<p><q>You have kept back something,</q> said the detec-
tive, instantly.</p>

<p><q>I didn't go for to do it, yer honour,</q> whined the
boy, and he brushed his sleeve over his dirty face.</p>

<p><q>Very well, then, what more have you to say?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, sir, it wasn't a tanner the cove gave me; it
was a bob.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah! that will do,</q> replied Forrest; <q>you can
go.</q> And the mudlark glad to be released took the
hint, and instantly disappeared, vanishing with a
brilliant display of evolutions known to the London
boy as <q>Catherine wheels.</q></p>

<head type="num">Chapter IV</head>
<head type="main"><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Matthew Kraker's Theory</head>

<p>The superintendent at Scotland Yard was not disap-
pointed in his amateur detective. Precisely as the
clock struck, a little man, about five-and-forty years
of age, clean shaved, quiet plump, and rosy, a soft-
spoken little man, whose only distinguished feature
was a pair of rather prominent bead-like, and restless
black eyes, which seemed perpetually on the watch
for something, entered the superintendent's private
room. He was respectably dressed, his shirt cuffs and
collar were of the whitest, he wore kid gloves, and he
carried a substantial silk umbrella. This was no less
a personage than <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Matthew Kraker. On entering
the room he bowed to the superintendent, and also,
though more slightly, to Forrest, who was likewise
punctual, being, indeed, rather contemptuously curi-
ous to know how an amateur would set about this
business.</p>

<p><q>I wish to see you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker,</q> said the super-
intendent, <q>On a matter of some importance, in which
I think it possible you may, if you feel disposed, be of
considerable assistance to us.</q></p>

<p><q>If you will let me know the nature of the diffi-
culty, I shall be glad to be of service.</q></p>

<p><q>I felt sure we might count upon you, and I will at
once put you in possession of the facts.</q></p>

<p>The superintendent then gave <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker all the
information with reference to the murder which had
come to his knowledge. While the officer of police
was speaking, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker's curious eyes, not restless
now, glittered like carbuncles. His face wore an ex-
pression of extreme satisfaction, and one might almost
go as far as to say it almost beamed. This incompre-
hensible man—at least to Forrest—heard all the
superintendent had to say without speaking a word
himself; and then, after an interval of silence, with-
out making any comments, asked permission to have
a man placed at his disposal and to be allowed, in
conducting the inquiry, to act entirely at his own
discretion.</p>

<p>The superintendent, after an instant's pause, said,
<q>I think I can grant you this; but remember that
you take upon yourself a considerable responsibility,
and I also, to a certain extent, am involved in the
result.</q></p>

<p><q>That is quite true,</q> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, <q>but you
may trust me for knowing what I am about.</q></p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1881-09-24 -->


<p>To this the police functionary made no reply, ex-
cept to take up a sheet of paper and write a few
words instructing the authorities at Hammersmith to
give <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker every facility for pursuing his in-
vestigations into the matter of the mysterious murder
of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <corr>Rennett</corr>. This paper once in his hand, the
amateur detective rose, and, saying he should
return before the day was over, at once quitted
the room, being joined at the door by a man who
had been instructed to accompany him. Taking a
hansom cab, the strangely-assorted pair proceeded
towards Hammersmith, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, maintaining a pro-
found silence by the way, as far as his companion
was concerned, but every now and then muttering to
himself, and moving his head very much in the
fashion of a dog scenting its prey. On arriving at
the police station he maintained the same air of re-
serve, asking only for paper and pencil, some plaster
of Paris, water, and oil. He then proceeded, accom-
panied by his attendant satellite, to Ivy Cottage. At
about six the same evening, his face glowing with
pride and satisfaction, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Matthew Kraker entered
the superintendent's office. The policeman who had
accompanied him to Hammersmith, and who had been
profoundly puzzled by his proceedings, followed care-
fully, carrying a large basket.</p>

<p><q>I have the thing completely at my fingers' ends,</q>
was his informal greeting to the superintendent as
soon as the office door was closed; <q>it's all as clear
as daylight. Johnson,</q> he added, addressing the con-
stable, <q>let us show something for our day's work.
Put the basket on the table.</q></p>

<p>At this moment Forrest, who had just returned from
the expedition he had undertaken on the faith of the
evidence of the woman and the young mudlark, en-
tered the room in some excitement, and with a face
no less triumphant that that of his amateur rival,
exclaimed eagerly—</p>

<p><q>I am on the track of the man with the earrings.</q></p>

<p>The superintendent looked at his usually calm sub-
ordinate with astonishment.</p>

<p><q>And who the deuce,</q> he said, <q>may the man with
the earrings be?</q></p>

<p><q>The murderer! the murderer of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <corr>Rennett</corr>.
Oh! I've spotted him safe enough; and it's Lombard
Street to a China orange that I shall clap the darbies
on him before the morning.</q></p>

<p><q>Are you sure you are right about your man?</q> de-
manded the superior officer.</p>

<p><q>As certain as that two and two make four.</q></p>

<p><q>And what sort of customer do you make him out
to be?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, he is described as an elderly man, a sailor
probably, wearing a blue guernsey and a pair of ear-
rings. Two of our man are on his track, and I expect
to hear of him shortly.</q></p>

<p><q>Hem!</q> said the inspector drily, <q>a great many
sailors wear blue guernseys and earrings, Forrest; but
we will see what comes of it. And now let us hear
what <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker has to say.</q></p>

<p>While this dialogue was going on, Kraker, without
heeding the detective's excited statement, proceeded
quietly to spread the contents of the basket on the
table. These comprised a large lump of muddy earth,
several sheets of paper, three or four little pieces of
plaster of Paris that were still moist, and had evi-
dently been used for taking moulds. Before the table
stood <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Matthew Kraker, whose appearance at the
moment resembled more than anything else a Cheap
Jack at a country fair, who had some wonderful
bargains to offer to a credulous public. His clothes,
it should be remarked, had by no means so neat an
appearance as in the morning, for he was covered with
mud from head to foot.</p>

<p><q>I will begin at the beginning,</q> he said, in a singu-
larly gentle tone, <q>and first of all, gentlemen, I may
as well tell you that we may quite understand each
other as we go on, that robbery has nothing to do with
this murder.</q></p>

<p><q>The devil it hasn't!</q> growled Forrest; <q>that'll
hardly do for me.</q></p>

<p><q>I shall prove it,</q> said Kraker, taking no notice of
Forrest's interruptions, <q>by evidence, and after-
wards explain to you what was, in my humble opinion,
the motive of the murderer. In the first place,</q> he
went on, <q>the murderer came to the house before
the rain began to fall—that is to say, before half-past
nine. I have been no more fortunate in this respect
than <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrest. I have found no muddy footprints
in the house, but, between the table and the corpse,
there are traces of dust such as would naturally come
off the boots of a person entering a house from a
dusty lane. We thus fix the hour at which the mur-
derer arrived. It must have been close upon half-past
nine; <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett evidently did not expect him, as
she had begun to make preparations for going to bed,
and was about to wind-up a cuckoo clock when he
must have knocked.</q></p>

<p><q>How do you make that out?</q> said Forrest, with a
scarcely concealed air of contempt.</p>

<p><q>Very easily,</q> was Kraker's calm reply. <q>Look
at this clock—the clock above the escritoire, I mean,</q>
he said, turning to the detective; <q>It is one of those
that don't go more than fourteen or fifteen hours.
Now, it is more than probably—nay, even certain—
that the murdered woman wound it up the evening
before that of the murder, just before going to bed.
This being so, how is it, you may ask, that the clock
stopped at five? The answer is obvious. Only going
about fifteen, or at the outside sixteen hours, it must
have run down, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett was about to wind
it up when the murderer's knock came to her door.</q></p>

<p><q>That's all very well, but it seems to be taking a
good deal for granted,</q> said Forrest.</p>

<p><q>In proof of this,</q> proceeded Kraker, <q>the chair
was in front of the clock, and on the stuffed seat was
the distinct mark of a woman's shoe. Then, look at
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett's dress, the bodice is unfastened. That
she might open the door as quickly as possible she did
not stay to fasten her dress, but, instead, threw an
old shawl over her shoulders.</q></p>

<p><q>There is something in that, indeed,</q> remarked the
superintendent.</p>

<p>Forrest said nothing, but was evidently impressed
by the astuteness of his rival.</p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett,</q> continued the amateur, <q>knew
the person who knocked. Her eagerness to open the
door makes one suspect it, and the result shows the
supposition to be correct. The murderer evidently
obtained admission without any difficulty; and now
we come to his description. He was a young man, a
little above the middle height, well dressed. He wore
a silk hat, carried an umbrella, and smoked cigars
through a holder.</q></p>

<p>Forrest could no longer contain himself. <q>The
devil!</q> he cried, <q>this is too much.</q></p>

<p><q>Probably,</q> returned Kraker, in the same gentle
voice in which he had spoken all along—<q>probably,
but it is the truth all the same. Have the kindness
to look for a moment upon these pieces of damp
plaster; they represent the soles of the murderer's
shoes, a capital impression of which I found in the
ditch near to the spot where the discovery of the key
took place. And here, upon this sheet of paper, I
have drawn the entire impression of a foot which,
being upon the grass, could not be taken by a mould.
The same footprint I have also found in the road, and
repeated five or six times in the garden, where no
other person has been since the crime.</q></p>

<p><q>And what do you make out of it?</q> said Forrest,
in a subdued tone.</p>

<p><q>This shows,</q> was the reply of the amateur, <q>that
the murderer knocked, not at the door, but at the
window shutter, through a chink of which he could
probably see a gleam of light. Well, in entering the
garden he evidently jumped to avoid being caught by
the thorns of the gooseberry bush—the point of a foot
pressed into the ground shows this clearly enough;
and as he jumped at least two yards, we have proof
positive that the man is young.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker said all this in a clear, soft, sweet,
modulated voice, his eyes wandering from time to
time from one to the other of his auditors, as though
to read their thoughts.</p>

<p><q>Are you astonished, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrest, that I should
know what hat the murderer wore?</q> he continued.
<q>Just examine the circle upon the marble of the
escritoire, which was a little dirty.</q></p>

<p>Forrest gave a dubious grunt, as though he reserved
his opinion.</p>

<p><q>Are you surprised that I should have determined
so positively upon the height of the murderer? Take
the trouble to notice the height of the shelves, and
you will find that the man could reach them with his
hand. You may say that he could have stood upon a
chair, but there is no sign of a chair having been used
for such a purpose, and in that case he would have
seen what was on the shelves, and need not have re-
moved them from their resting-place on the escri-
toire.</q></p>

<p>Again Forrest gave a grunt, as if determined to
commit himself to nothing.</p>

<p><q>Does the umbrella puzzle you? This lump of
earth bears an admirable impression, not only of the
ferrule, but of the metal ring which supports the
ribs. Do you wonder at the cigar? Here is the end
of a cheroot which I found in the ashes. Has it been
moistened by the mouth? No; it must have been
smoked through a cigar-holder.</q></p>

<p>The superintendent did not disguise his admiration
of the astuteness of the amateur. As for Forrest,
though in some measure impressed, he still on the
whole looked on the story with a somewhat disdainful
air, evidently regarding it in the light of a romance.</p>

<p><q>So far, so good,</q> continued Kraker. <q>We will
now go a little further. Please to imagine that this
young man has now obtained admission to the house.
What explanation there may be for his coming at such
an hour I am unable to say; but it is certain that he
told <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett he was hungry, for she prepared
some supper for him.</q></p>

<p><q>Why not for herself?</q> asked Forrest.</p>

<p><q>It is quite evident that the supper was not for
herself alone. In the cupboard I found some fish, the
remains of her dinner; and some fish, nearly digested,
was proved by the <foreign xml:lang="fr">post-mortem</foreign> examination to be in
her stomach. She was cooking ham and eggs at the
time she was killed, and there were two glasses, two
knives, two forks, and two plates upon the table. We
now,</q> continued <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker complacently, <q>come to
the gist of the whole matter. Who was this young
man, the murderer of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett? It is pretty
certain that the widow looked upon him as of a station
superior to her own. In the dresser drawer was a
fairly clean table-cloth, but for her visitor she had
spread one perfectly clean, and of finer quality; she
had also put a better kind of tumbler on the table
than most of those in the cupboard, while the knives
had ivory handles—those she was in the habit of using
having only black bone ones.</q></p>

<p><q>You are exceedingly precise,</q> said the superin-
tendent.</p>

<p><q>I am obliged to be,</q> was the reply. <q>To con-
tinue—the murderer has seated himself; he begins by
drinking a glass of sherry, while the hostess is busy
with the frying pan in front of the fire. Then, his
heart failing him, he asks for some brandy, and drinks,
as we see by the appearance of the newly-opened
bottle, a couple of small glasses. In about ten
minutes, for the ham and eggs were just ready for the
table, the man rises, creeps softly to the woman while
she is kneeling over the fire, and stabs her in the back.
She does not die directly, she turns half round, and
clutches at the hand of the murderer, who seizes her
and flings her to the ground. This is shown by the
position of the corpse. Struck in the back, it is upon
her back that she is discovered. The murderer was
armed with a broken foil, which was afterwards wiped
upon the petticoat of the murdered woman, and the
trace of blood thus given shows the nature of the
weapon used.</q></p>

<p><q>Confound it!</q> burst out Forrest, <q>this is more
like a story out of some book. It isn't business at
all.</q></p>

<p><q>Stay,</q> interposed the superintendent, <q>let us
hear <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker to the end. It is only fair.</q></p>

<p>The detective, after grumbling to himself, subsided,
and Matthew Kraker continued as if he had not been
interrupted.</p>

<p><q>Did you notice the nails of the dead woman, <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Forrest?</q> he asked. <q>No! Very well, go and look
at them, and tell me if I have made a mistake. Now,
then, as to the motive of the murderer. What did he
want? Money or valuables? Not a bit of it. What
he wanted, what he came after, and what he looked
for were papers—papers which he knew were in the
possession of the deceased. In order to find them he
upset everything, ransacked the drawers, unfolded
the clothes, broke open the escritoire, which he hadn't
got the key of, and pulled the bed off the bedstead.</q></p>

<p>Forrest shook his head, and smiled incredulously.</p>

<p><q>At last he found what he was looking for, and
what do you suppose he did with them? Burnt them,
not in the grate, but in the frying pan; and then, his
object accomplished, he fled, taking with him all that
was handy, or worth carrying away, so as to give the
appearance of a robbery, and throw the police off the
scent.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker ceased. His story was told, and now
nothing remained but to act upon the admirable and
logical deductions he had evolved. For a moment the
superintendent was silent. Matthew Kraker's method
of working was to him quite novel, and he was
astonished at the complete chain of facts which he
had presented so simply and so forcibly.</p>

<p><q>I must confess, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, you have almost
persuaded me that you are right, and that robbery,
after all, was not the motive for the murder.</q></p>

<p><q>But,</q> urged Forrest, <q>what about the man with
the earrings? Here is an absolute statement, and
what have we got against it? Nothing but a string
of fanciful conjectures. Besides, how would a young
swell—for according to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker's romance he is a
fashionable gent—load himself with all that has been
taken away? Perhaps you don't happen to know,</q>
he added, turning to the amateur detective, and
speaking in an ironical tone, <q>that the property
taken away consisted of a plated cruet-stand, a silver
teapot, a cream jug—old-fashioned, it's true, but none
the less bulky for that—a dozen spoons and forks—to
say nothing of a large goblet won in a boat race by
a certain James Rennett five-and-twenty years ago.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker stood in an attitude of attention while
Forrest ran over the list, and seemed as if he were
checking off the items one by one.</p>

<p><q>Your memory is good,</q> he observed; <q>you have
omitted nothing.</q></p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1881-10-01 -->

<p><q>Very well, then, how do you suppose this bulky
parcel was carried off?</q></p>

<p><q>Merely by tying it up in a sheet (there was no
sheet on the bed, perhaps you may have noticed),
walking along the road with it in the direction of
Hammersmith Bridge, and when on the bridge getting
rid of it by dropping it in the river. It is certain he
would not ride in an omnibus or cab—it would have
attracted attention, besides which it must have led to
his discovery. No, he walked, and then threw the
parcel into the Thames. Three boatmen have since
mid-day been dragging for it, and if I am not very
much mistaken——</q></p>

<p>At this moment came a knock at the door. It was
opened, and a policeman was was standing outside
came in, and, saluting the superintendent, informed
him that three men had brought a parcel for <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Matthew Kraker.</p>

<p>The superintendent turned to the amateur detective
in astonishment.</p>

<p><q>It is as I expected,</q> said the latter, perfectly un-
moved. <q>They have brought the plate.</q></p>

<p>This, indeed, was the case, and, much to Forrest's
chagrin, not an article missing. Kraker's view of the
matter was completely confirmed—the crime was not
committed for the sake of gain.</p>

<p><q>What do you think now?</q> asked Kraker, a pecu-
liar smile lighting up his quiet features, the only sign
of exultation which had hitherto escaped him.</p>

<p><q>I am bound to admit that your penetration is
marvellous,</q> replied the superintendent. <q>There is
one thing, though, I should like to satisfy my mind
about. Here is the result of the post-mortem exami-
nation. It would be as well to see how far it supports
your theory.</q></p>

<p><q>By all means,</q> returned the little man, cheer-
fully.</p>

<p>The post-mortem singularly confirmed the ideas he
had advanced. The doctor explained the position of
the corpse in the same way as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker had done,
and, like the latter, the opinion of the medical man
was that there had been a struggle. In addition, on
the neck of the deceased he had noticed a blue circle,
hardly perceptible, but no doubt caused by the mur-
derer's grasp. He also stated that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett had
evidently made a hearty meal about three hours
before she was stabbed. Matthew Kraker had with
minute care examined the nails of the corpse, and
had, after some difficultly, been able to extract some
portions of skin. The largest, perhaps, was not the
twentieth part of an inch, but the grey colour could
be easily distinguished. These, with the marks on
the petticoat, where the weapon had been wiped, the
end of a cigar, and the prints of the umbrella and the
feet, were all that the murderer had left behind him.
It was not much, but sufficient to give hope to the
superintendent.</p>

<p>One of the greatest obstacles in the way of the de-
tection of mysterious crimes is an error in the motive,
for if a mistake is made in the beginning, its conse-
quences, the farther one goes, lead more and more
from the truth. Thanks, however, to the decided
advance made by Kraker, he was sanguine of success,
and he was the more anxious that success should be
attained, because of late the detective police had been
very unfortunate in their inquiries. More than one
crime of magnitude had gone undetected, and several
newspapers had made some extremely unpleasant and
caustic remarks on the subject.</p>

<p><q>Do not hesitate to do anything you may think
best,</q> he said at parting.</p>

<p><q>You need not fear,</q> replied Kraker. <q>I may
probably see you to-morrow, but if not do not be sur-
prised.</q></p>

<p>And so saying, he glided rather than walked out
of the room, shutting the door softly behind him.</p>

</div>



<div n="5" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter V.</head>
<head type="main"><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker Ruminates.</head>

<p>Matthew Kraker lived, as we have already said, in
Hunter Street, Bloomsbury, not a very aristocratic
locality, but, at the same time, not altogether a
poverty-stricken one. He occupied the first floor, and
passed for a quiet but eccentric man, who had made a
little money in business, and who, like hundreds of
other men, was <q>something in the city.</q> He never
spoke about his connection with the police, and not a
soul among his few acquaintances suspected it. He
had no relations, save a few thirty-third cousins or so
living in the wilds of Lincolnshire, and having lost
both parents early, had been accustomed all his life
to shift for himself. He had visited many foreign
countries, and could speak more than one European
language like a native. Being of a frugal disposition,
and wanting little, he had saved some money, and
this, perhaps, not so much from a miserly spirit as
from an indifference to those things which some people
deem necessities, but which he classed as luxuries.
He had never cared for amusements or for drinking,
and did not readily make friends. As a billiard
marker, or as a croupier of a <foreign xml:lang="fr">rouge et noir</foreign> table at a
German watering place, he had seen an infinite variety
of life; so much so that the study of character had
become with him a perfect passion. In his capacity
as croupier he had been brought several times in con-
tact with the Continental detective police, and had
assisted them greatly in the arrest of more than one
notorious forger. When the establishment with which
he was connected became bankrupt he came back to
England, settled down upon his earnings, which were
enough to support him, and looked about for some-
thing to employ his leisure. Instinct, rather than
any other motive, led him to haunt the police courts
for years, and there was scarcely a famous trial at the
Old Bailey from which he was absent. Chance led
him against a young barrister who had gained a cer-
tain reputation for defence in criminal cases. The
latter, in one or two conversations they had together,
was struck with the extraordinary acumen, and pro-
found knowledge of human motives which the ex-
croupier displayed. He suggested that he might
employ his talents to advantage as a detective, and
Matthew had taken the hint, though with some
obstinacy he refused to enter the force, observing that
he could not work with rule and line, and must go in
his own way, or not at all. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston's (the bar-
rister already mentioned) chief practice lay in the
northern circuit, and the introduction he had been
able to give to Kraker had reference to cases in the
north, and, curiously enough, the murder at Hammer-
smith was the first affair of any moment which he
had undertaken in London. His successes, however,
were well known to the metropolitan police, and this,
as we have already said, led the chief of the detective
department at Scotland Yard to employ him. But he
never gave up his independence. Money would not
tempt him to take up a case unless he felt an interest
in it, and provided there was sufficient scope for his
peculiar talent, he cared not whether he was paid. His
sitting room, which overlooked the street, was a fairly
large apartment, comfortably furnished, the most
conspicuous object in the room being a large bookcase,
well stocked with books. A glance at the titles of
these would have revealed at once the taste of the
owner. A complete edition of the <title>Newgate Calendar</title>,
many volumes of state trials, biographies of notorious
criminals, police reports, not only of the metropolis
but of the provinces, and not confined to Great
Britain, scrapbooks full of newspaper cuttings, all
relating more or less to crime, made up the bulk of
the library, the remainder consisting chiefly of law
and medical works, a large proportion of the latter
having reference to mental diseases. Beyond this
bookcase there was nothing in the room to betray in
the least degree the occupation of the owner, and
though his frequent absence from home, his unexpected
returns at all times of the day and night, sometimes
made his landlady wonder, and certainly added not a
little to her discomfort, she never had the remotest
suspicion that he passed his time in bringing criminals
to justice. But he paid well, gave no trouble about
his meals, being perfectly contented with what she
chose to give him so that he had not to wait for it,
and at last she got used to his habits, and ceased to
trouble or talk about them. His visitors were very
few, and, with one exception, he rarely called to see
anyone as a matter of friendship. This exception was
a widow lady, named Delanne, who lived with her son
in Bedford Square, Tottenham Court Road. To <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Delanne's house he used to make a periodical visit
about once a fortnight, and in his heart secretly ad-
mired the lady, who, though past her prime, was still
a fascinating woman, and must have been in her youth
remarkably handsome. Her son, Gerald, was about
thirty years of age, but looked much older. He was
possessed of great talent, and of an inordinate ambi-
tion. He had been educated as a doctor, but after
walking the hospitals he came to the conclusion that
surgery was not his proper vocation, and he turned his
attention to the bar, not so much with the intention
of practising as to make use of the bar as a stepping
stone to something greater. He had dabbled con-
siderably in literature, and had obtained an engage-
ment as leader writer for a daily paper. He was a
practised speaker, and his secret desire, for the
accomplishment of which all his efforts were concen-
trated, was to get into Parliament. Tall and well
made, he was strikingly handsome, his well-cut fea-
tures and somewhat pale complexion being well
relieved by masses of dark brown wavy hair. Under
a somewhat cold exterior he concealed a passionate
and ardent nature, and those who saw him when he
had thrown aside the mask which he usually wore as
far as the outside world was concerned could scarcely
believe him to be the same man.</p>

<p>So much for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne and her son, whom we
have thus particularly mentioned, as by a singular
chance of accidents they play a somewhat prominent
part in the curious drama the plot of which we are
attempting to unfold.</p>

<p>To go back to Matthew Kraker. After leaving
Scotland Yard he walked rapidly in the direction of
Regent's Park, and, with his hands buried deep in his
pockets, and his eyes fixed upon the ground, walked
up and down the most solitary parts he could find for
nearly an hour. Occasionally he muttered something
under his breath; had anyone been near enough they
would have heard that it was always the same thing
that he repeated over and over again, the words of the
murdered woman given in the evidence of the milk-
woman at the coroner's inquest. <q><q>If I wanted more
money I could get it.</q> That's the whole gist of the
matter,</q> he muttered after a pause, during which he
frowned until his brows nearly met. <q>This <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Rennett must have had a knowledge of something
which it was the interest of some rich person or other
to keep concealed. As long as the secret was safe she
could count on claiming money. Yes, but what is the
secret, and how did she get hold of it? That's the
rub. Let me see. Supposing she had at some time
or another been a servant in a rich family. Mightn't
she have seen, or heard, or discovered something
which concerned somebody? If so, the chances are a
thousand to one it would concern a woman. Her
mistress might have been married and had a lover.
Why not? It would complicate matters a bit, but it's
not at all unlikely. We should have to find out not
only the lady but the gentleman as well, which would
be a little awkward, but would have to be done; for,
of course, the man would be the actual murderer.
Now, then, let us go a step further. I should be in-
clined to think that the man was some person of rank.
An ordinary tradesman, or one of what we call the
middle classes, wouldn't have pluck enough, not would
there be sufficient motive. No; this is the work of
someone of good birth, and not only that, but he him-
self has been the perpetrator. He has had no accom-
plice, but trusted in himself, and admirably has he
carried out his purpose. A neater or better-contrived
thing I never heard or read of.</q></p>

<p>The little man became almost enthusiastic as
he spoke, and his small eyes sparkled like dia-
monds.</p>

<p><q>The fellow left nothing to chance,</q> he said. <q>It
was well planned—well planned. Forrest by himself
would have made a sad mess of it. Just the sort of
thing one might expect from an ordinary detective.
Provided an offence by committed by one of what we
call the criminal classes they are equal to it, but let
the offender by something out of the common order,
and to have gone about the business with his brains,
then they are nowhere. It is no more than I should
have expected.</q></p>

<p>Thus soliloquising he arrived at Hunter Street, and
stopping in front of 102, gave a loud knock. The
door was opened by a good-natured, stupid-looking
woman of about fifty-five.</p>

<p><q>Lor', <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, how you did startle me!</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker was still absorbed in the engrossing
subject of the day, and scarcely heard her. His re-
ply was to ask whether she had any dinner ready.</p>

<p><q>Bless the man,</q> exclaimed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield, <q>dinner
at this hour! Why, it's just struck eight. But
there—I'll get a nice chop ready for you in less than
no time.</q></p>

<p><q>That will do,</q> he returned, and, mounting the
staircase, he entered his room, and after lighting the
gas, began pacing up and down the room in a some-
what abstracted fashion.</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield, in the meantime, began to make pre-
parations for the meal, and in the intervals of laying
the cloth and arranging the table, gossiped as was her
wont; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, as was his wont, scarcely replying,
or if he did, only in monosyllable. When the chop
was ready, he sat down to it with the same pre-
occupied air which had marked him all day.</p>

<p><q>Well, I never,</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield, who after
leaving the room for a few minutes to fetch some beer,
returned to find <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker sitting before his untasted
chop, his knife and fork in his hand, but his gaze
directed towards a <corr>cruet stand</corr>, as if he were meditating
an attack upon it. <q>I never saw anyone like you.
There's that beautiful chop, and you a-sitting afore it
like a stony image.</q></p>

<p><q>Eh?</q> said her eccentric lodger, roused from his
reverie, <q>oh! I see. All right, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield, you
can go.</q></p>

<p>He had scarcely swallowed two mouthfuls, when he
alarmed his landlady by suddenly exclaiming—</p>

<p><q>The devil! I have it.</q></p>

<p><q>Bless me! have what?</q> said good <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield,
with a vague suspicion that a black beetle or a mouse
had caused <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker to give vent to so violent an
ejaculation.</p>

<p><q>Oh! nothing</q> he returned, dropping into his
usual tone of voice. <q>I'll ring when I want you,
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield.</q></p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1881-10-08 -->

<!-- episode printed 1881-10-15-->

<p>But <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield, with the pertinacity of her sex,
did not immediately obey, and before she had left the
room <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker was again absorbed in the all-
engrossing subject.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> he mused half aloud, <q>I'll wager there's
a child mixed up somehow in the business.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield pricked up her ears. <q>A child,</q> she
thought. <q>What can he have to do with children?
Ahem!</q> she coughed.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker descended from his hobby horse.</p>

<p><q>What are you waiting for, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield?</q> he
asked, rather irritably.</p>

<p><q>Nothing, sir, nothing,</q> answered the dame with
alacrity.</p>

<p><q>Then, pray, leave me alone.</q></p>

<p>And <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield, somewhat abashed, hurried from
the room.</p>

<p>For a few minutes he went on eating, and having
satisfied his hunger, pursued the train of thought
which <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield had so disturbed.</p>

<p><q>Aye,</q> he muttered, <q>there is a child, and this is
something like its history. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett was pro-
bably the servant of some rich, perhaps a titled lady.
The husband might be fond of travel, or in the army.
While he is away, his wife, maybe, has a lover. She
gets into a fix, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett helps her out of it.
A child is born, and then——</q></p>

<p>Our detective seemed to be in difficulty. He
frowned, rubbed his forehead, and finally sought re-
lief in pacing up and down the room.</p>

<p><q>They wouldn't have got rid of the child, because
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett herself would have been compromised.
No; in all probability she had brought it up, and
very likely the father is the man who, as the evidence
went to show, came in a carriage, while the mother is
the lady who was accompanied by a young man. Of
course, she would be will paid, because she would get
money from both sides. But then, what was the
motive for murdering her? She used to live well,
and sometimes, perhaps very often, took too much.
She may have grown exacting in her demands, know-
ing she could, if she liked, raise such a deuce of a
hornet's nest; or they might have been afraid lest in
a drunken moment her tongue became rather slippery.
Yes, that's the most likely. Granting this, who would
have done the ugly work—the father or the son? The
chances are every way in favour of the son.</q></p>

<p>At this moment came a knock at the door. It was
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield, who had come to inquire if her lodger
would take cheese?</p>

<p><q>Yes, yes. Confound the woman! What on
earth makes her such a nuisance just when I want to
be quiet?</q></p>

<p>The cheese was brought, and he ate a small portion,
and then returned to the little history he had sketched
out in his mind. But somehow, whether the process
of digestion is not good for reflection, or whether it
was due to the interruptions of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield, his
thoughts had become disturbed, disjointed. He
could go no farther than the romance he had laid
down. How to apply it practically to the difficult
problem he had to solve he could not see. <q>What I
want now is a friend to talk the matter over with. It
is so easy to deceive oneself. Besides, there is such
an advantage in two persons approaching a subject
from different points of view. But who to go to?
Forrest?</q> A smile passed over his face, and he shook
with internal laughter. <q>Not he; a good fellow in
his way, but quite at sea here. Preston (the barrister
before mentioned) is out of town, or I would go to
him. What is the time? Just nine (pulling out his
watch). Ah! Gerald Delanne will be at home now.
I will go and see him. He is a shrewd, clear-headed
fellow; it will go hard if I can't get an idea or two
out of him.</q> And, putting on his hat, and taking his
walking stick, without which he was rarely seen, he
descended the stairs.</p>

<p><q>What time shall you return, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker?</q> asked
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corfield, calling out from somewhere in the lower
regions.</p>

<p><q>Can't say.</q></p>

<p><q>Shall anyone sit up?</q></p>

<p><q>No, no, of course not.</q></p>

<p>And, banging the door to, he strode off in the direc-
tion of Russell Square, and in little more than five
minutes was at his friend's house.</p>

<head type="main">On the Track.</head>

<p>As we have already said, he was on very familiar
terms with the Delannes. He frequently strolled in
about this hour, and was always sure of a hearty
welcome. They did not keep much company—that is
to say, as far as the lady was concerned; but Gerald
had a large circle of friends, and frequently gave
dinner parties, more for ulterior reasons that for any
real love of sociality. Between the mother and son
the utmost affection existed. She had a profound
faith in his talents, and firmly believed in his ultimate
distinction. Indeed, her love for him had become
almost a passion; in her eyes he could do no wrong,
and his slightest wish was law. When he spoke she
was silent, and listened. She studied his tastes, an-
ticipated every desire, and, in a word, lived but for
him. On his side he accepted this adoration with a
kind of nonchalance, whether real or affected it was
difficult for a stranger to say; but those who knew
him asserted that in his secret heart he entertained for
her a very deep affection. The servant who opened the
door was so accustomed to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker's visits, that
she was not surprised he should walk past her with-
out taking the usual precaution of asking whether her
master or mistress were at home. He thus walked
into the sitting room where they usually say un-
announced. A single wax candle (Gerald abhorred
gas) lighted the apartment, which was in its accus-
tomed order. A walnut table usually in the centre
had, however, been moved into a corner, while on the
ground, close by the sofa on which <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne
usually sat, was a newspaper half folded. Neither
the lady nor the son were in the room. The amateur
detective took in the whole scene at a glance.</p>

<p><q>Something has happened,</q> said he, turning to the
servant, who had followed him up the staircase.
<q>What is it?</q></p>

<p>The girl's face wore an air of concern, and she re-
plied, in some agitation, <q>Oh, sir, we've had such a
fright!</q></p>

<p><q>Why, what has frightened you?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, sir, you know missis hasn't been very well
for the last month, hasn't eaten anything, and all
that. Well, she came upstairs after dinner, as she
generally does, and asked me to fetch her the <title>Times</title>.
She likes to read the paper a bit after dinner, you
know, sir.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> returned <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker.</p>

<p><q>Well, I fetched her the paper, and she scarcely
looked at it half-a-minute when she gave, oh! such a
dreadful scream—I shall never forget it,</q> said the
girl, with a shudder—<q>and fell on the ground just as
if she'd been struck dead. I was just going out of
the door when she fell, and it gave me such a fright
I could do nothing but scream for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gerald.</q></p>

<p><q>Was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gerald in the house, then?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, in his own room. He came running up-
stairs, and lifted her up, and carried her into her
bedroom.</q></p>

<p><q>And is she better?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know, sir. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gerald said it was only a
fainting fit, and that she would soon get over it; but
he said she'd better not be disturbed, so I haven't seen
her. She's come to, I know, because I heard her
speaking, and I thought it was so curious.</q></p>

<p><q>Thought what was so curious?</q> asked the little
man.</p>

<p><q>What she said to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gerald. I was standing
near the door, and I heard her say——</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, in spite of his detective proclivities,
never expressed them except in a business capacity.
He had, also, a good deal of gentlemanly feeling, and
rarely descended to idle gossip.</p>

<p><q>What <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne said is of no consequence to
me, or to you either, especially as you heard it outside
the door. I'm sure your master and mistress would
be very angry if they knew what you had been
saying.</q></p>

<p><q>I know, sir. I beg your pardon,</q> said the girl,
turning red, <q>I didn't mean anything.</q></p>

<p><q>No, perhaps not. But there, that will do. You
need not disturb <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gerald; I will wait.</q></p>

<p>In some confusion the girl went out of the room,
and left <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker to himself. To amuse himself he
took up the newspaper which was lying on the ground,
moved the sofa nearer the table so as to be nearer the
light, and settled down to read at his ease. He had
not read a dozen lines before he started and uttered
an exclamation of surprise. The paragraph which
had thus arrested his attention ran as follows:—</p>

<p><q>Hammersmith was yesterday the scene of a ter-
rible tragedy, which has caused the utmost excitement
in that usually quiet neighbourhood. A woman named
Rennett, living by herself in Ivy Cottage, Water
Lane, has been found lying dead in her house, with a
large wound in the back, evidently caused by some
sharp instrument.</q></p>

<p>Then followed some details, and the paragraph
wound up by stating that the greatest activity was
being displayed by the police, and it was believed that
they were already on the track of the murderer.</p>

<p><q>The devil!</q> muttered <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker; <q>surely this
paragraph can have nothing to do with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <corr>Delanne's</corr>
fainting fit? No, no, impossible,</q> he murmured.
<q>Thinking about this business so much has made me
stupid.</q></p>

<p>However, an irresistible curiosity made him closely
examine the paper. He could find nothing with the
exception of this paragraph likely to cause the slightest
emotion.</p>

<p><q>To say the least it is a singular coincidence,</q> he
said to himself. A second examination showed to
him that the edge of the paper close to the paragraph
was crumpled and a little torn, as if by a convulsive
hand. <q>Devil take it! it's odd,</q> he thought.</p>

<p>At this moment a step was heard descending the
staircase, and immediately afterwards the door opened
and Gerald came in. He started at seeing <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker,
as he doubtless thought the room was empty; but he
came forward at once, and held out his hand. His
usually calm face wore a troubled look, and the hand
which Matthew grasped was icy cold.</p>

<p><q>How is your mother?</q> asked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker in a tone
of concern. <q>Nothing serious, I hope?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, dear, no; <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne will doubtless be
better in the morning.</q></p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne,</q> thought Matthew, <q>how strangely
he talks of her. Ah,</q> he added aloud, <q>she had a
spasm of some kind. The heart, perhaps?</q></p>

<p><q>Perhaps,</q> repeated the young man, in a tone of
constraint. In spite of his apparent self-possession,
it was evident Gerald was moved by some internal
struggle, and after a pause, during which he had sunk
into a chair as if overcome, he suddenly exclaimed, in
an agitated voice, <q>The fact is, Kraker, I've made a
shocking discovery, and it's completely upset me.</q></p>

<p><q>Indeed,</q> replied the little man, in his soft tone;
<q>what is the matter?</q></p>

<p>The young man hesitated, as if he were not quite
prepared for such an abrupt question. At length he
said, <q>Well, to tell you the immediate cause of my
mother's indisposition, it is simply this:—She was
reading the <title>Times</title>, when by chance she came across a
paragraph relating to a murder, in which the person
murdered happened to be a very old friend.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Matthew Kraker said nothing, but his eyes
shone the brighter at this extraordinary chance which
had thrown him against someone who could tell him
something of the past history of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett. Prac-
tised, however, as he was at concealing his emotions,
he did not betray himself, and even Gerald did not
know his connection with the police, and it was im-
portant, he felt, that <corr>this</corr> should not be revealed. He
took the paper which young Delanne placed in his
hand with every appearance of curiosity, and read the
paragraph as if he had never seen it before in his
life.</p>

<p><q>Good God!</q> he exclaimed, <q>what a horrible
affair.</q></p>

<p><q>This <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett,</q> continued Delanne, in a
grave, measured tone, <q>was at one time devoted to
my—to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne's interest. The attachments of
servants to their employers is a thing, as a rule, met
with only in books; but in her case it was really the
blind devotion of the dog. I believe she would have
gone through fire and water to serve my mother.</q></p>

<p><q>Then, I suppose, you also knew this woman?</q>
asked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, <corr>unconcernedly</corr>.</p>

<p><q>A long while ago—I should say at least ten
years,</q> replied <corr>Gerald</corr> in whose voice there was a
peculiar sadness. <q>To tell you the truth, she was my
nurse.</q></p>

<p>Matthew opened his eyes at this, and muttered
something under his breath. The murdered woman
Gerald's nurse! There was certainly something
almost providential in this. In less than half-an-
hour he had obtained all, and more than he could have
hoped after days of anxious search. He could scarcely
utter a word, and yet, to avoid appearing singular, he
knew he must say something, express some kind of
sympathy.</p>

<p><q>It is a frightful business,</q> he muttered.</p>

<p><q>You are right, for me, at least, if not for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Delanne. It is scarcely creditable; it is more like a
far-fetched romance than the plain truth—but the
death of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett has given a death blow to all
my hopes—all my ambition.</q></p>

<p>He seemed so dejected, and spoke in so low a tone
that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker scarcely heard what he said. Leaning
forward, Gerald continued, <q>I have been the victim
of a most cruel injustice, aye, an injustice the most
bitter that can be inflicted on a man. By Heaven! I
believe I am the most miserable fellow alive.</q></p>

<p>The amateur detective listened attentively, but was
much puzzled by Gerald's mysterious words. What
possible connection could there be between his hopes
and ambition and the murder at Hammersmith? He
felt that it was of supreme importance that he should
know all that the young man could tell him, but how
if he were not disposed to open his mouth? After a
minute's reflection he decided upon his course of action.</p>

<p><q>Gerald,</q> he said, <q>we must look this matter in
the face. Tell me a little more, and I'll wager that
we shall be able between us to see a way out of the
difficulty.</q></p>

<p>It must be confessed that he spoke somewhat at
random, and what the difficulty he alluded to consisted
of he had not the least idea. But, as fortune would
have it, his chance expression answered his purpose
completely. Delanne rose to his feet abruptly, and
passing his hand through his hair, exclaimed <q>Yes, I
will tell you all. In truth, the weight of this horrible
secret has been almost too much for my brain the last
three weeks. I have indeed need of a friend in whom
I might confide.</q></p>

<p><q>My dear Delanne,</q> returned Kraker, <q>I am an
older man than you, and have seen something of the
world. If I can help you in any way you have but to
speak.</q></p>

<p>The young man was silent for a moment, and then
resumed: <q>Then you must know—but no—I cannot
tell you the story here—come to my own room.</q></p>

<p>And so saying he led the way downstairs, followed
by the amateur detective.</p>

<head type="num">Chapter VII.</head>
<head type="main">An Extraordinary Story.</head>

<p><q>Are you not afraid to leave your mother?</q> said he.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> replied the young man. <q>If <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne
requires anything she can ring. The servant will
attend to her.</q></p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne again,</q> murmured <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker.
<q>How coldly he speaks of her, and he used to be so
fond and attentive. What can have happened?</q></p>

<p>The young man must have read his thoughts, for he
said in a dry, constrained tone, <q>I see you wonder at
my calling my mother <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne. I do it for the
simplest and best of all reasons. She is not my
mother.</q></p>

<p>His words fell like the stroke of a hammer upon the
ears of the amateur detective.</p>

<p><q>Nonsense,</q> said he, with a positive air. <q>It is
absurd, impossible. You have been working too hard,
and this sudden ill news of the mother's has warped
your brain.</q></p>

<p><q>It is absurd, impossible,</q> repeated Gerald in a
grave tone, <q>but it is true, Kraker. For thirty-three
years—that is to say, since the day of my birth—this
woman has played a deceptive, a treacherous part
towards me, that her son—for she had a son—might
benefit.</q></p>

<p><q>My dear friend,</q> commenced Matthew Kraker,
who now began to see a glimmer of light, as it were,
fall upon the dark and impenetrable tragedy whose
smallest details he had set himself to unearth. But
Gerald never heeded his interruption, and, indeed, he
seemed dead to everything but his own thoughts.
Cold and self-constrained as he usually was, those
passions over which he kept so strong a curb seemed
to be surging within his breast, and to be asserting
their power in spite of his efforts to control them.</p>

<p><q>I say to you solemnly, and before God, there
never was a man more cruelly deceived than I have
been. Believing her to be my mother I loved her
heart and soul; I would have made any sacrifice for
her. And she—she must have held me in scorn. Her
deception dates from the time when she first held me
in her arms, and from that time she has never wavered
in the detestable part she comes to play. Her devo-
tion was a falsehood, her caresses simply clever acting,
her whole life has been a lie.</q></p>

<p><q>Hush,</q> muttered Kraker, who, in spite of his
hardihood, was inexpressibly shocked.</p>

<p><q>You know not what she has been guilty of, or you
would not say that,</q> returned Gerald. <q>No, do not
you wonder why she should take all this trouble to
deceive me? but the answer is very simple. That she
might betray me, rob me of my birthright, give all
to her own child—the child of sin, of shame—all, my
name, future, everything.</q></p>

<p>He ceased for a moment, for the violence of his
passion has deprived him of breath. The great drops
of perspiration stood on his brow, and his features
worked convulsively. Never could Matthew have
believed such a transformation possible.</p>

<p><q>Can you be aware of the dreadful charge you are
bringing against <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne?</q> asked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker,
taking advantage of the pause to say a word or two,
<q>you know, if what you say is true, we must suppose
that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne possesses an audacity, a power of
acting, which few women ever attain to. Besides,
she would not have acted thus alone. She must have
had a reason for doing thus. Who were her accom-
plices? Her husband?</q></p>

<p><q>Her husband!</q> said Gerald, with a bitter laugh.
<q>There is no husband. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Delanne has never
existed, save in the imagination of the widow. She
was the mistress of my father, and the money upon
which she has lived is the price of shame. Good
heaven! can you not see it all?</q></p>

<p><q>I must confess I do not,</q> returned <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker;
<q>but do not get so excited. Tell me all calmly,
quietly, and I shall <!-- removed "be"--> then be better able to help you.
While you storm and rave I can do nothing. How
did you learn all this, and what proof have you that
it is true?</q> The cool, decided tone of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker
seems to have its effect upon the young man. He
threw himself into an easy chair, and buried his face
in his hands. Then lifting his head, after a minute
or more's reflection, he said, almost in a whisper, <q>I
have known it for three weeks. It was quite a chance
discovery, and I have, at least, indirect truth of the
proof of my assertion. One word, and one word only,
pronounced by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett would have made these
indirect proofs certainties, but this word, as we know
by the newspapers, she can never utter. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne
would deny all, yes, though she stood upon the
scaffold. I know her. After so many years of decep-
tion I cannot expect my father to side with me. I
am, of course, a total stranger to him.</q></p>

<p><q>But how did you find all this out?</q> asked Mat-
thew, who had been silently revolving something
within himself while Gerald had been talking.</p>

<p><q>Simply by chance. It so happened I lost some
papers, and thinking the servant might have put them
by mistake in <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne's <corr>escritoire</corr>, I opened the
lid. As I did so a packet of letters fell to the ground,
and being but loosely tied, were scattered about. I
picked them up, intending to replace them, when,
upon looking at the superscriptions, written in a bold,
masculine hand, and the seal, upon which there was
a crest, I felt an irresistible desire to open them.
They had evidently been written years ago, for the
paper was yellow and the ink faded. I hesitated,
naturally hating the meanness of the action, but at
last I yielded, and read the first letter which came to
my hand.</q></p>

<p><q>That was wrong,</q> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker in a low voice.</p>

<p><q>I am perfectly aware of that, but, as I tell you,
I read the letter, and had not got farther than ten
lines before I found that it was from my father, about
whom <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne had always been so strangely, so
obstinately silent. You can easily imagine how I felt.
Consumed by a desire I could not resist, I did not
rest until I had read the whole of the correspondence,
which told me too plainly the shameful story.</q></p>

<p><q>You have those letters yet?</q> asked Matthew.</p>

<p><q>Certainly. My first impulse was to put them
back, and keep the secret which had been so un-
expectedly put into my hands; but, on thinking the
matter over, the sense of the wrong that had been done
me became more and more vivid, and so at last I took
possession of them, determined to fight the battle to
the last, no matter who might be affected by the
result.</q></p>

<p>He rose as he spoke, and, walking to the writing
table, opened a small brass-bound desk, and took from
a secret drawer a packet of letters, with which he
returned to the amateur detective.</p>

<p><q>You will understand, Kraker,</q> said he, <q>that I
don't want to bore you with insignificant details, and
will only ask you to read those letters which go to
establish the truth of my assertions. I have gone
carefully through them all, and numbered them with regard
to dates. <abbr>Nos.</abbr> 1 to 6 have no particular bearing on
the matter, so we will begin with <abbr>No.</abbr> 7.</q></p>

<p>He opened the letter, and forthwith commenced:—</p>

<p><q><q>My Dearest Margaret,—To-day has been a happy
day. I received your delightful letter this morning,
and read it a hundred times. You cannot think how
glad the news it contained has made me. I thought
at first you had been deceived, but from what you now
say it must be really true. And yet, mingled with
my joy comes the miserable thought that I can never
place you in that position which is yours by right.
Never as in this moment have I so cursed this fatal
marriage which my family have forced upon me. I
will not go so far as to say that I hate my unhappy
wife, who, like myself, has been compelled to wear
the chains which gall and chafe at every turn, but
that I can ever love her is perfectly impossible; yet
by a strange destiny, and if as to add to my perplexi-
ties, she tells me that she, like yourself, is about to
become a mother. Should both be boys I dare not
contemplate the consequences. The son of her I love
can never bear my name, never inherit that to which
he is entitled; while the son of the woman with whom
I am mated, but for whom I care not an atom, will
take my title, will come into possession of my estates.
All that I can do is to make what reparation I can
both to you and to my son—yours and mine—while I
live. That, believe me, my own Margaret, will be
the one object of my life.</q></q></p>

<p><q>And then follow some tender expressions,</q> broke
in Gerald, smiling bitterly as he spoke; <q>such as a
lover would naturally use towards his mistress. We
need not read this part.</q></p>

<p><q>What is the date of this letter?</q> asked Matthew.</p>

<p><q>You may see for yourself,</q> rejoined the young
man, holding out the paper.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker took it in his hand, and read—</p>

<p><q>Mayfair, 15th November, 1825.</q></p>

<p><q>You will see presently,</q> went on young Delanne,
<q>the importance of this first letter. It establishes
the motive of the scheme afterwards carried out—that
is to say, it shows that my father, married against his
will to a woman unsuited to him, adored his mistress.
Both women are about to become mothers at the same
time, and his feelings with regard to the children are
not far to seek. Even now, if I am not much mis-
taken, the shadow of the idea which he was later on
not afraid to put into practical execution was hover-
ing over his mind.</q></p>

<p>Judging from what we know of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Matthew
Kraker it might be supposed that he was highly
imaginable. This was not the case. The story he had
evolved was but the natural deduction of a close and
minute observation. In point of fact, he was essen-
tially practical.</p>

<p><q>You have said enough,</q> he interrupted, for Gerald
was about to enter into an elaborate statement of the
reasons which had led him to come to his opinions;
<q>I understand perfectly the position so far.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well. I pass by letters, 7, 8, and 9, and
come to <abbr>No.</abbr> 10, dated January 19, 1827. The only
passage I need runs as follows:—</q></p>

<p><q><q>The condition of the Countess becomes more and
more evident. I know not whether it is my fancy,
but she seems to suspect the cause of my coldness to
her. I cannot help it. You alone hold my heart. I
feel pity for her, but destiny must have its way.</q></q></p>

<p><q>All these letters,</q> continued Gerald, holding up
some half-a-dozen letters, <q>are in the same strain. I
need not weary you with these, since they only go to
establish more fully what we already suspect. Now,
here is one of a different kind. It is short but de-
cisive:—</q></p>

<p><q><q>Dearest Margaret,—Pray let me know as near as
you possibly can, the hour. I await your answer
with intense anxiety, which I think you will under-
stand if you can imagine my plans for the future of
our child.</q></q></p>

<p><q>I do not know,</q> said the young man, looking up
from the paper, <q>whether <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne complied;
but, at all events, she seems to have answered at once,
for here is a letter dated but three days afterwards:—</q></p>

<p><q><q>Your answer, dearest, tells me more than I dared
to hope. The project I have conceived is now prac-
ticable. Our child will bear my name, and I shall
not be separated from him. He will be brought up
under my care, and he will never know the secret of
his birth.</q></q></p>

<p><q>I beg your pardon, Gerald,</q> interrupted Matthew,
<q>but you do not tell me your father's name—do you
know it?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> replied the young man gravely; <q>my father
was the Earl of Annesley.</q></p>

<p><q>Phew!</q> whistled the ex-croupier, <q>one of the
richest peers in England,</q> he said to himself.</p>

<p><q>In the month of May,</q> continued Gerald, <q>my
father seems to have been staying at Cheltenham, and
there, in the madness of his passion for his mistress
not only conceived, but confided to paper one of the
most monstrous projects you can possibly imagine.
Hear what he says:—</q></p>

<p><q><q>Richard Taylor, the bearer of this letter, is my
valet, and a man to be thoroughly trusted. From
what you tell me there should now be no delay in
carrying out my plan. Three weeks later I expect to
be in London, where the confinement of the Countess
will take place. A wet nurse, a woman in whom I
have the fullest confidence, has been engaged, and
when the child is old enough she will proceed to
Hagley, in Yorkshire, where, as you know, I have
property. You will meet her at a place I shall after-
wards name, and by chance pass the night at the
same inn. To change the children, I need not say,
will be a matter of no difficulty. Every precaution
has been taken, and I now only want your an-
swer.</q></q></p>

<p><q>Oh,</q> thought Kraker, <q>this, then, is the key to
the problem. I was not so far out after all. And,</q>
he continued aloud, <q><corr>your</corr> mother—I beg pardon—
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne, how did she take this proposal?</q></p>

<p><q>She didn't seem to half like it, for here are eight
pages or so in which the Earl tries to persuade her.
Then my father seems to have come to London, for
the correspondence ceases, and we have no letter till
this one written in June, and dated from the House
of Lords:—</q></p>

<p><q><q>Your letter, dearest, has filled me with joy.
Now that you are able to go out I have arranged with
Matilda Rennett, in whom I have the most perfect
confidence, to carry out the plan I have proposed to
you.</q></q></p>

<p><q>You see,</q> observed Gerald, breaking off, <q>that
the children, of whom I was one, have been born, so
that nothing now remains but to put the project into
execution. The correspondence closes here, and with
it my story.</q></p>

<p><q>Is there nothing more?</q> asked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker.</p>

<p><q>About ten lines, written years after, but they add
nothing to what we already know.</q></p>

<p><q>That's unlucky,</q> observed the amateur detective
thoughtfully.</p>

<p><q>Now look here, Kraker,</q> said the young man,
looking fixedly at his friend, and speaking very slowly
and distinctly, <q>suppose that all my proof ceases here
—suppose that I know nothing more than what I have
told you—what is your opinion?</q></p>

<p>Matthew Kraker did not reply for some moments.
He was occupied in weighing the probabilities result-
ing from the letters of the Earl.</p>

<p><q>Upon my soul,</q> said he, at last, with emphasis,
<q>I believe sincerely you are not the son of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Delanne.</q></p>

<p><q>And, before Heaven, you are right,</q> returned
Gerald, solemnly. <q>My first thought after seeing
Viscount Morleigh was to seek Matilda Rennett. I
found her, and though she denied at first all know-
ledge of the Annesley family, I afterwards compelled
her, partly by threats and partly by bribes, to confess.
The plan of the Earl, she told me, succeeded without
a single hitch. A month after my birth I was be-
trayed, dispossessed of my inheritance, and virtually
deserted by my father. In her heart <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett
was thoroughly on my side, and she promised, when
the time arrived, to come forward and give her
evidence. That, of course, is now all over, and my
only hope is from the letters she may have in her
possession. She absolutely offered me some when I
visited her. Like an ass, I refused them.</q></p>

<p><q>That was a mistake,</q> replied Matthew gravely.
He knew, better than anyone else, how much hope
was to be placed on this point. <q>These were the
letters,</q> he said to himself, <q>the murderer was in
search of. When he found them he burnt them in
the frying pan.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, but who could have supposed that the un-
fortunate creature was about to lose her life?</q></p>

<p><q>You are right,</q> returned Kraker, musing. And
then, after a pause, he said, <q>Has your father actu-
ally taken no notice of you in any way?</q></p>

<p><q>I can remember a tall, good looking, well-dressed
man coming to see me at school, but that is all.
Probably I should have seen more of him but for a
rupture between him and his mistress.</q></p>

<p><q>The deuce! How did you find that out?</q></p>

<p>Gerald turned over the letters on the table, and at
last took up one dingier and more frayed at the edges
than the rest. He read the following:—</p>

<p><q><q>A friend, candid and cruel, as true friends
are, has opened my eyes. I at first doubted, but
you have been watched, and, unhappily, I am
now convinced. You have deceived me, and I
know not whether this has not always been the
case.</q></q></p>

<!-- episode printed 1881-10-29 -->

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne,</q> continued Gerald, <q>tried to
justify herself, but to no purpose. These other
letters show that the upshot of the thing was that
they separated; my father agreeing to allow her £500
a-year.</q></p>

<p>A light tap at the door interrupted the young man.</p>

<p><q>Who is it?</q> he called out.</p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne would like to speak to you, sir,</q>
said the voice of the servant.</p>

<p>Gerald hesitated, and glanced at Kraker.</p>

<p><q>You had better go,</q> said the latter, rightly in-
terpreting the glance. The young man shrugged his
shoulders, as if the task were an unpleasant one, but
rose from his seat and went out.</p>

<p><q>Poor fellow,</q> thought the amateur detective, now
left to himself. <q>His has been very hard lines, and,
as far as I can see, he has not much chance of getting
his own. However, that's his affair. Mine is con-
cerned more with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett. These letters are
invaluable, and I'm very much tempted to appro-
priate one for a short time in case I want to compare
the handwriting. It's always best to be forearmed.
Yes, I will,</q> and, with his usual cool air, he took up
one of the yellow pieces of paper and deliberately
placed it in his pocket.</p>

</div>



<div n="8" type="chapter">

<head type="num">Chapter VIII.</head>
<head type="main">In Which Kraker Comes to the Rescue.</head>

<p>A minute afterwards Gerald returned. Nothing, to
judge from his demeanour, had passed between him
and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne of an exciting character. He was
calm and undisturbed as ever.</p>

<p><q>Well,</q> asked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, <q>how did you find
her?</q></p>

<p><q>Very bad indeed. She has become delirious, and
had called for me. The servant, not being aware that
she knew not what she said, of course, came <corr>at</corr> once.
I have sent for the doctor, and in the meantime Jane
is with her.</q></p>

<p>Thus speaking, Gerald sat down at the table, and
began sorting the letters according to their dates. He
was evidently disinclined for further conversation,
for he returned but laconic answers to Matthew's re-
marks, and appeared to be wholly engaged upon his
occupation. This, however, did not at all suit the
detective, who wanted to satisfy himself on several
points in the extraordinary revelations which had just
been made to him.</p>

<p><q>The more I hear of your extraordinary story,</q>
said Kraker, <q>the more it puzzles me. To tell you
the truth, if I were in your position I should be puzzled
how to act.</q></p>

<p><q>Very likely,</q> returned the young man. <q>My
experience of life has been large, very large, but this
has entirely confounded me.</q></p>

<p>The amateur detective repressed with difficulty a
smile. <q>I confess humbly,</q> said he, taking a gentle
pleasure in being by inference taxed with comparative
inexperience, <q>that your knowledge of life may be
larger than mine; but to return to our subject—your
first step, of course, was to ask an explanation of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Delanne?</q></p>

<p><q>Exactly,</q> replied Gerald.</p>

<p><q>And what did she say?</q></p>

<p><q>What could she say—was she not already proved
guilty?</q></p>

<p><q>What? Did she not try to defend herself?</q></p>

<p><q>It was impossible. She pretended to explain the
correspondence, and she said—how can I remember
what she said?</q> exclaimed Gerald passionately. <q>She
took refuge in subterfuge—in lies.</q></p>

<p>The young man rose from his seat excitedly, and
collecting his letters without noticing that Kraker had
abstracted one of the number, tied them up carefully,
and replaced them in the secret drawer of his desk.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> he continued, pacing up and down the room,
as if the exercise allayed the agitation, <q>yes, she
promised to explain the matter, but how could she
with the proofs I hold? She loves her own offspring,
and the idea that he should be made to restore what
he has—unconsciously, if you like—stolen from me,
is incoherent to her. And I, fool that I was, fancied
she loved me, and once thought of keeping the whole
matter secret. She love me! No, that she never did.
She would see me suffer the most horrible tortures
rather than that her son should come to the slightest
harm.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you think she has warned the Earl?</q> said
Matthew Kraker.</p>

<p><q>It is quite possible; but I do not think it would
be of any use. The Earl has been out of town a
month, and is not expected before the end of the
week.</q></p>

<p><q>How did you find this out?</q></p>

<p><q>I went to see him—to speak to him.</q></p>

<p><q>The deuce you did!</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, do you think I could be silent? Do you
imagine I, robbed, defrauded, betrayed, even from
my birth, would not open my mouth? Why should I
hold my tongue? Who is to prevent me from speak-
ing? The right is mine, and does it surprise you that
I should seek the Earl?</q></p>

<p><q>Not at all, my friend. Well, you went to see
your father?</q></p>

<p><q>I did not come to this resolution immediately,</q>
said Gerald, <q>for, to tell you the truth, the discovery
had almost made me lose my head, and I wanted time
to reflect. A thousand thoughts disturbed—passion
blinded me. I desired my birthright, wealth, power,
and position, but I felt pity for those who would
suffer, and tried to find some way out of the difficulty,
by which it could be arranged without noise, and
without any scandal.</q></p>

<p><q>And did you decide upon anything?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, after a fortnight of mental agony I came to
a conclusion that I must put an end to this miserable
state of suspense, and I went direct to the town re-
sidence of the Earl in Chester Square.</q></p>

<p><q>And when you arrived there?</q></p>

<p><q>I asked to see the Earl. A servant told me that
he was out of town, but that the Viscount Morleigh
was at home. This did not answer my purpose.
However, there I was, and I determined, somehow,
to go through with the business. The servant had
some hesitation in sending up my name, as I had not
arrived in a carriage, and he had, indeed, seen me get
out of a hansom; but, on my insisting, he eventually
complied, and in a few minutes I was committed to
the care of the Viscount's valet. He wished to know
who I was, where I came from, what I wanted and so
forth. I simply replied that, although absolutely
unknown to the Viscount, I wanted five minutes'
conversation with him on an important matter. After
some hesitation he asked me to sit down and wait till
he returned, and about ten minutes he came back
with the information that his master had consented
to see me.</q></p>

<p>It was easy to see that this cool reception had
rankled in the heart of Gerald, who had taken what
was a mere matter of course under the circumstances
as a personal affront.</p>

<p><q>He conducted me,</q> continued Gerald, after a
pause, <q>into a small room, the walls of which were
hung with a number of boxing gloves, dumb bells,
pistols, guns, and foils. I had never seen so many
weapons in so small a space. There were enough to
stock a small armoury.</q></p>

<p>There was something in this speech peculiarly in-
teresting to Kraker. The word <q>foils</q> naturally
recalled to his mind the weapon with which <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Rennett has been assassinated.</p>

<p><q>The Viscount,</q> Gerald went on to say, <q>was
lounging on a couch when I entered. I am bound to
confess that he is a gentlemanly fellow, fairly good-
looking, and not likely, from his appearance, to dis-
grace the name he bears. He is about my height,
dark, like myself, and his features would resemble
mine if he did not wear his beard. Apart from this
he seems to be younger than I am by five or six years;
but, no doubt, this is due to the fact that he has lived
an easy life.</q></p>

<p>Gerald paused for a moment, as if choked with
envious bitterness.</p>

<p><q>As I entered,</q> he resumed, <q>the Viscount half
rose and saluted me politely. <q>You do not know me,
my lord,</q> I said. <q>Can't say I do, my dear fellow,</q>
he replied carelessly. I took no notice of his observa-
tion,</q> remarked Gerald, <q>but continued—<q>I have to
speak to you on a most serious matter, and one which
concerns the honour of the name you bear.</q> Of
course, he did not believe me, for he replied in a very
off-hand tone, <q>Will it take long?</q> <q>I am afraid it
will,</q> I replied, quietly.</q></p>

<p><q>I beg your pardon,</q> interrupted Kraker, <q>but I
take rather an interest in this affair, and if you would
be kind enough to tell me everything that took place
in the course of the interview, not omitting a single
detail, I shall be obliged.</q></p>

<p><q>The Viscount,</q> continued Gerald, somewhat with
the air of a schoolboy repeating a lesson by heart,
<q>resumed his former lounging attitude with the
manner of a man who has made up his mind to endure
an undeserved infliction. <q>If you will be kind enough
to be as quick as you can,</q> he said, <q>I shall take it as
a favour; for I shall very shortly have to leave to keep
an important engagement.</q> My reply to this was to
take out of my pocket the correspondence, and give to
the Viscount one of the letters. I at once saw, by
the expression of his face, that he recognised the
writing.</q></p>

<p><q>One word,</q> interrupted Kraker, <q>did he appear
at all concerned on seeing these letters?</q></p>

<p><q>He showed not the last concern in the world.</q></p>

<p><q>He did not seem in any hurry to take the letter
out of the envelope?</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly not; and, seeing this, I determined to
hasten matters, and told him my mission was a very
painful one. He looked at me with an air of surprise,
and replied, <q>Have the kindness to speak out at once.
What is it you have to say?</q> <q>It is simply this,</q> said
I, speaking in as calm a voice as I could assume,
<q>that you are not the legitimate son of the Earl of
Annesley. The letters that I have brought with me,
and whose handwriting you doubtless recognise, will
show that I speak the truth; and, moreover, the
legitimate son now exists in the person of him who is
now addressing you.</q> I looked at him steadily while
I said these words,</q> continued Gerald, <q>and saw that
his features became convulsed with passion. At first
I thought he would have knocked me down, but he
controlled himself by a violent effort, and asked to
see the remainder of the letters.</q></p>

<p><q>You did not give them to him?</q> said Kraker.</p>

<p><q>Indeed I did. Why not?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, nothing; only it seemed to me a rash display
of confidence.</q></p>

<p><q>Not at all,</q> returned the young man, in a tone of
concentrated and fierce determination; <q>there was no
danger, I promise you, of his destroying them while I
was with him. What I did with you, Kraker, this
evening, I did with Viscount Morleigh. I gave him
the letters, and bade him read those only marked
with a cross, and to pay especial attention to those
underlined in red. He took them silently, and,
opening them one after the other, read their contents
as if unwilling to lose a word. Meanwhile I amused
myself with walking about the room, but, neverthe-
less, kept a careful watch on every movement that
my brother made. Never in my life did I see any-
thing that impressed me more than his face, and if I
live for a thousand years I shall not forget it. In less
than five minutes his countenance had so altered that
his own valet would never have recognised him.
After a while, he took out his handkerchief, and held
it over the lower part of his face, as if to conceal his
emotion. His working features were whiter than the
handkerchief, great drops of perspiration stood upon
his forehead, and his eyes seemed to be starting from
their sockets. But not a word, not an exclamation,
not a sigh escaped him. At one moment I felt so
much pity for his wretchedness that I was half
tempted to take the letters from his hands and throw
them into the fire.</q></p>

<p>Gerald paused for a moment, overcome as it ap-
peared, by the memory of the scene.</p>

<p><q>In about half-an-hour,</q> he continued, <q>the Vis-
count had finished the perusal of the letters, and,
with more calmness that I should have believed pos-
sible, he placed them once more in my hands, looking
at me steadily the while.</q></p>

<p><q><q>You are right,</q> he said to me, in a low voice;
<q>if these letters are my father's—and I feel that they
are—they go to prove that I am not the son of the
Countess of Annesley.</q></q></p>

<p><q>I did not reply; what, under such <corr>circumstances</corr>,
could I say?</q></p>

<p><q><q>However,</q> he continued, <q>this is only <corr>presump-
tive</corr> evidence; have you any other proofs?</q></q></p>

<p><q><q>Richard Taplow,</q> said I, <q>possibly might tell
you more.</q></q></p>

<p><q><q>Taplow has been dead for many years,</q> he re-
plied.</q></p>

<p><q>Then I spoke of the nurse, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett. I told
him it would be easy to find her and get her evidence,
as she lived at Hammersmith.</q></p>

<p><q>And what reply did he make to your last state-
ment?</q> inquired the amateur detective somewhat
eagerly.</p>

<p><q>He did not reply at all at first, and seemed to
be lost in thought. Then, suddenly, he exclaimed
that he must know her; that he could remember
going with his father to her house, at least three
times; he also had some indistinct recollection of the
Earl giving her money.</q></p>

<p><q>I told him that to my mind that was an addi-
tional proof. He did not reply, and, after a long
silence, I asked him if he had anything further to
say.</q></p>

<p><q><q>I expect my father here in eight or ten days,</q> he
replied; <q>you must give me, at least, this time.
Immediately upon his return I will open the whole
matter to him, and if what you say be true, I give you
my word of honour that justice will be done. Take
your letters, and leave me, for I am too bewildered,
too confused, to say another word at this moment.</q></q></p>

<p><q>And did he really say that?</q> demanded Kraker,
half incredulously.</p>

<p><q>Really—almost word for word, in fact.</q></p>

<p><q>Scoundrel!</q> said the amateur detective, grinding
the words out between his teeth.</p>

<p>Gerald heard that he was speaking, but could not
catch the expression.</p>

<p><q>What did you say?</q> he <choice><corr>enquired</corr><orig>explained</orig></choice>.</p>

<p><q>I say he is a brave fellow,</q> returned Kraker,
<q>and I should be only too delighted to make his
acquaintance.</q></p>

<p><q>I did not show the Viscount the letter breaking
off my father's intimacy with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne,</q> remarked
Gerald, <q>I would keep the proof to myself if pos-
sible, rather than humiliate him still further.</q></p>

<p><q>But that letter is of the utmost importance.
How can you keep it secret?</q></p>

<p><q>As I have told you, I shall wait the Earl's return.
If he should refuse to do me justice, I shall demand
an examination of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett's letters. If those
letters bearing on the subject are found the cause is
saved; if not—ah! who will advise me what to do?</q></p>

<p><q>A good deal of reflection is wanted to give a little
counsel—that is, if the counsel is worth giving,</q>
replied Kraker sententiously; <q>but, my poor boy,
what a hard life yours is just now.</q></p>

<p><q>Frightfully hard; and my money difficulties make
it worse and worse.</q></p>

<p><q>Money difficulties! How is that? You live
quietly, and spend little.</q></p>

<p><q>I have entered into arrangements which will, no
doubt, prove profitable eventually, but in the mean-
time they are a constant drain upon my purse; and,
to tell the truth, just now, I don't know where to
look for money.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm very glad you told me that. My dear
boy, you have done me a good turn.</q></p>

<p><q>Eh,what? I really don't understand you,</q> said
Gerald, looking, as he certainly felt, completely be-
wildered.</p>

<p><q>Fancy that I have in my desk at home some £500
or £600 that I don't know what to do with,</q> replied
Kraker, just a little embarrassed in his turn; <q>you
understand me. I am getting old, my habits are in-
expensive, and the money is really useless in my
hands.</q></p>

<p><q>I fear that you would rob yourself on my account,</q>
said Gerald; <q>my dear old friend, I could never
allow that.</q></p>

<p><q>Nonsense,</q> returned Kraker, <q>don't say another
word, and to-morrow you shall have money.</q></p>

<p><q>But, remember, if the money once passes into my
hands it will soon pass out of them, and I may not be
able to call it up if you should suddenly want it.</q></p>

<p><q>Now, I think of it,</q> said Kraker, <q>you shall have
the money not to-morrow, but this very evening. I
will not have it lying idle, tempting one in a thousand
ways any longer.</q></p>

<p>Saying this he hastily left the room, and in less than
half-an-hour returned with a triumphant smile upon
his face.</p>

<p><q>There,</q> he said, pressing into Gerald's hand ten
£50 Bank of England notes, <q>there, and if that is not
enough, I have some more in the place they came
from.</q></p>

<p><q>I won't try to thank you,</q> said Gerald, <q>except
in the way you will understand best—my accepting
your kindness. In one moment I will give you a
receipt for the amount.</q></p>

<p><q>What is the use of being in such a hurry?</q>
returned Kraker, <q>it will be in time enough to-
morrow, I suppose.</q></p>

<p><q>Between ourselves, yes; but if I should die to-
night?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, in case of that,</q> said Kraker, with a smile,
<q>make your will at once, and leave me the money.
Good-bye for the present. You have asked my
advice, and I must sleep upon it. I have an idea that
everything will come right. But I <corr>will</corr> take a walk
before going to bed, or I shall have a horrible night-
mare. Meantime, dear boy, have patience and
courage; who knows whether Providence is not work-
ing for you at this very moment.</q></p>

<p>With these words he took his departure. Gerald,
who attended him to the door, listened till his foot-
steps died away in the distance, and then returned to
his apartment. He now took a little parcel from one
of his drawers, carefully placed in his purse the bank
notes which his old friend had given him; and all this
done, left the room, double-locking the door behind
him. He listened on the staircase for a moment or
so, but all was silent. He stole down the stairs on
tiptoe, opened the door quietly, and the next instant
was in the street.</p>

</div>


<div n="9" type="chapter">

<head type="num">Chapter IX.</head>
<head type="main">The Skeleton in the House</head>

<p>Once outside the house Gerald paused for a moment
on the pavement as if uncertain what direction to
take. He at length turned slowly towards Oxford
Street, and hailed a passing cab—a crawler on the
look-out for a fare.</p>

<p><q>Drive me to Devonshire Road, Regent's Park,</q>
said the young barrister; <q>and be quick about it.</q></p>

<p><q>All right, sir,</q> said the cabby, who at once scented a
double fare, and urged his jaded horse to its utmost
speed.</p>

<p>At the place indicated Gerald alighted, and paid
the driver a sum which was evidently satisfactory to
that modern representative of Jehu. He lingered till
the vehicle was out of sight, and, after going a
hundred yards or so, stopped at what an auctioneer
would call <q>a neat villa residence.</q> Pushing open
the gate he walked up the gravelled path slowly and
with a preoccupied air, and knocked softly at the
door.</p>

<p>It was speedily opened, and Gerald entered without
hesitation. As he touched the handle of a door on
the left <corr>hand side</corr> of the hall, he said, inquiringly, to
the servant, <q>Your mistress is here, I suppose?</q>
<q>Yes, sir,</q> she replied, hesitatingly. He noticed her
manner.</p>

<p><q>What, is there anything the matter?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, no sir; only madame has been a little out of
sorts to-day. She would have gone to your office but
I persuaded her not to.</q></p>

<p><q>You were quite right, Jane.</q></p>

<p><q>I was about to take some coffee to madame—shall
I bring a cup for you, sir?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> said he, laconically. He turned the handle
and walked into the room. It was luxuriously fur-
nished, more, perhaps, in the French than in the
English style; that is to say, there were plenty of
mirrors, an abundance of gilding, velvet chairs, and
rich lace curtains. A lamp, over which was a crimson
shade, illuminated the apartment with a soft light,
and in the bright steel grate, although it was June,
glowed a large fire, in front of which, upon a Persian
rug, lay a Maltese terrier, who every now and then
opened his eyes lazily to look at his mistress. The
latter, in an attitude of langour, reclined upon a velvet
couch, the crimson tint of which harmonised delight-
fully with the rich brown of her complexion. She was
scarcely nineteen, but had all the charms of woman-
hood. Her form was round and supple, her shoulders
were those of an exquisitely chiselled statue, and the
little foot, encased in a satin slipper, peeping out from
beneath her robe, would have served as the model for
a painter. Her face was beautiful, very; but perhaps
her beauty lay in the expression rather than in the
regularity of her features. She had a broad, but
somewhat low forehead; large lustrous eyes, which
could melt or sparkle with equal facility; a mouth
perhaps a little too small to please a fastidious taste;
bright red, pouting lips, and a beautifully shaped
chin. The nose, perhaps, was the worst feature of the
face; like the mouth, it was a little too small. Her
glossy hair of raven tint was coiled up somewhat in
Oriental fashion, and the broad gilt band which con-
fined its tresses was thoroughly in keeping with the
style of her beauty. Her complexion was dark, but
beautifully clear, and a warm red of a delicate tint
mantled her cheeks. A physiognomist would have
summed her up as very beautiful, very passionate, and
very selfish. As Gerald entered a frown contracted
her brow, and she turned her head away pettishly.
He advanced towards her, and, bending over her
beautiful face, kissed her cheek softly. She made a
gesture of impatience.</p>

<p><q>At last,</q> she said, half angrily, <q>you have come.
I thought you had forgotten me altogether.</q></p>

<p><q>It was quite impossible for you to see me sooner,</q>
returned the young man. <q>I have had some very
important business to look after.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, of course, that's always the cry—business,
business. And I have business also, for I have been
nearly driven wild with those insolent tradesmen.
There's the upholsterer has called twice, and declares
he cannot wait another day; the livery stable keeper
where we had the carriage says I cannot have any
more drives until the bill is paid; the butcher——</q></p>

<p><q>My dearest Lucie——</q> began the young man.</p>

<p><q>Yes, it is easy to say <q>My dearest Lucie</q> when
you are here, but when you are away I'm quite for-
gotten, I know that very well,</q> and the offended
beauty put a lace handkerchief to her eyes, and smelt
vigorously at her vinaigrette.</p>

<p><q>How can you be so unjust?</q> replied Gerald,
passionately. <q>Do I not always think of you? Have
I not proved it a hundred times? See, I have not
forgotten you to-day, have I?</q></p>

<p>He took from his pocket the little packet before
mentioned, and unfolding the paper covering displayed
a magnificent gold bracelet.</p>

<p><q>There,</q> he said, holding it out, <q>there is the
bracelet you admired so much in Bond Street the
other day.</q></p>

<p>Lucie, without altering her position, took the
bracelet in her hand, looked at it carelessly, and
simply said, <q>Ah.</q></p>

<p><q>Does it not please you?</q> asked Gerald, with just
the slightest possible shade of vexation in his tone.</p>

<p><q>Yes, pretty well. I thought it was handsomer.
It looked so in the shop.</q></p>

<p>And with an air of indifference she threw the
trinket on the little table by her side.</p>

<p>Something very much like an impolite ejaculation
escaped the young man. <q>I am not in luck to-day,</q>
he said between his teeth.</p>

<p><q>Why not?</q> asked the lady in a pretended air of
surprise.</p>

<p><q>I see very well that you do not care for my
present,</q> said he.</p>

<p><q>Pray do not say that. You know I have always
been pleased with everything you have given me.</q></p>

<p>It was Gerald's turn to say <q>Ah,</q> and then, as the
girl did not reply, he went on, <q>It may please you,
but hang me if you look very happy over it.</q></p>

<p><q>Indeed,</q> rejoined Mademoiselle Lucie, in a tone
something between laughing and crying. <q>Would
you like one to go into ruptures, to throw myself at
your knees, and kiss your hands! Shall I call up
Jane and the cook, and tell them how happy I am to
have so generous a lover?</q></p>

<p>Her words stung the young man to the quick.</p>

<p><q>Lucie,</q> he cried, impetuously, <q>it is cruel of you
to say such things. If I have committed any serious
offence let me know it at once.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well, then, I will be serious. Now, don't
you think it would have been wiser of you to have
forgotten all about that bracelet, and brought me,
yesterday evening or this morning, that £100 I want
so much?</q></p>

<p><q>I could not come,</q> returned Gerald, sullenly.</p>

<p><q>You could have sent it. There are messengers, I
suppose, to be had.</q></p>

<p><q>My dearest Lucie, the simple truth is I could
neither bring nor send the money, for I had not got it.
If I have some with me now I owe it to the merest
chance, for an hour ago I knew not where to lay me
hand upon a shilling.</q></p>

<p><q>Poor fellow!</q> replied the lady, ironically; <q>do
you mean to tell me you haven't got £100?</q></p>

<p><q>I swear it—not of my own.</q></p>

<p>The girl looked at him for a moment, and then
something in his woe-begone appearance seemed to
assure her mightily, for she burst into a ringing shout
of laughter. <q>My dear Gerald—Ha! ha! ha!
Pray, don't look so dismal. It's very well acted,
but——</q></p>

<p><q>I tell you it is no acting at all,</q> he rejoined,
fiercely; <q>I am at my wits' end for money.</q></p>

<p>The girl saw that she had tormented him enough.</p>

<p><q>There, my dear boy, don't make yourself miserable
over it,</q> said she, in a softer voice. Curiously
enough, the thought that a man had ruined himself
for her sake was enough to soften her heart at once
towards him. She rose suddenly, and running lightly
to him, flung her arms around his neck. <q>You stupid
fellow,</q> she whispered, <q>I do not mean to vex you.
I do not, indeed. You are very kind, and I love
you—oh, so much. We are not going to quarrel are
we?</q></p>

<p>In an instant he had forgotten everything. She
knew her power over him, and when he had kissed
her, and said he had quite forgiven her, she resumed
with a little pout and just a shade of malice, <q>And
have I been so very expensive, then?</q></p>

<p><q>Not at first. You were wonderfully moderate in
your demands. A year ago a house at Islington was
sufficient for you, but now nothing less than Regent's
Park will do. Then the furniture was pronounced
old-fashioned, and, of course, there had to be new.
And what with two servants, dress, jewellery, car-
riage drives, boxes at the theatre, and——</q></p>

<p><q>There—there; for goodness' sake don't go over
the horrid list. How much is it altogether?</q></p>

<p><q>Not less than £2,000 in a twelvemonth.</q></p>

<p><q>Are you quite sure?</q> she asked putting on expres-
sion of intense agony.</p>

<p><q>As certain as I once had the money and haven't
got it now.</q></p>

<p><q>£2,000,</q> she repeated. <q>You are positive there
are no shillings and no pence?</q></p>

<p>In spite of the gravity of the subject he could not
refrain from laughing.</p>

<p><q>You are a sad girl, Lucie,</q> said he, playfully
pinching her ear, <q>and I shall never teach you habits
of economy.</q></p>

<p>The servant entering just at this moment with the
coffee somewhat interrupted these manifestations of
love, and drawing a chair close to the couch, Gerald
sat himself by the side of the young lady, who re-
suming her favourite attitude on the couch, submitted
to be waited on with becoming resignation.</p>

<!-- episode printed 1881-11-12 -->

<p>Lucie Davenport's history is soon told. Born in
Paris, an English father, but of a French mother, the
foreign element decidedly predominated. Extra-
vagant, fond of pleasure, rather selfish, and certainly
vain, she had early in life learned the power of her
beautiful face. Her father dying not long after her
birth, his widow went on the stage and attained a fair
position as an actress at the Porte <abbr>St.</abbr> Martin. Lucie
entered the ballet when but seven years old, and her
precocious talent and unbounded self-possession soon
gained her hosts of admirers. Her career presented
nothing different from that of hundreds of her class.
A fresh lover every week, for whom she cared
nothing; a multitude of presents, which she took
care to turn into money; compliments which she took
at their true value; one eternal round of excitement
had been her experience ever since she could remem-
ber anything. Coming to London as premier danseuse
at Her Majesty's, she made the <corr>acquaintance</corr> of
Gerald Delanne, and for the first time in her life had
fallen in love. The sequel Gerald's own words have
sufficiently indicated. She was not absolutely vicious,
and her faults were, perhaps, due more to her educa-
tion than to her own nature. Her dream was to be
loved as Antony loved Cleopatra, to have a man half-
ruin himself for her sake, one who would descend to
her level rather than seek to raise her to his, was her
ambition. The presents which Gerald lavished upon
her she cared but little for, and, perhaps, had he been
more exacting she would have loved him with a higher
love. But the fact was, she believed him to be rich,
and as he had carefully concealed from her his embar-
rassments, she was ignorant of the sacrifice he had
made for her. As for Gerald, he adored her. Up to
the fatal hour when he met Lucie he had lived like a
hermit. But before her he had weakly capitulated,
and so infatuated was he that in two years he had
spent not only his own earnings but the invested
capital of his mother. He loved Lucie madly, with-
out reflection, without even common prudence. When
with her the mask of coldness and self-control fell
from him. She possessed him body and soul. He
had sometimes tried to oppose her unreasoning capri-
ces, but before her he was as a reed bent by the wind.
She goaded him and tortured him almost beyond
endurance, but a smile, a tear, or a kiss, and all was
forgotten. Once beyond the spell of the enchantress
reason returned, and his cool intellect told him that
she did not love him, that she but played with his
passion; but his infatuation had taken so deep a hold
in his heart he could not uproot it. He had even
suspected her fidelity, but had never had the courage
to declare his suspicions. At the very idea of giving
her up his blood seemed to congeal, and he preferred
agonising doubts to a desolate certainty. The en-
trance of the servant with the tea gave Gerald time to
recover himself, and already he began to ask himself
whether he had not been too stern with the beautiful
creature who had so enslaved him.</p>

<p><q>My love,</q> said he, caressingly, <q>if I have done
wrong you have sufficiently punished me. Come, let
us sign a truce.</q></p>

<p>She withdrew herself from his proferred embrace,
and returned pettishly—</p>

<p><q>There, that's enough. How many times am I to
tell you I am not well this evening?</q></p>

<p><q>Not well!</q> exclaimed the young man, in an
anxious tone. <q>Why did you not say so before?</q></p>

<p><q>It's nothing. My complaint is that I am so
tired.</q></p>

<p><q>Not of me?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, of you, and everything, and everybody.</q></p>

<p>Gerald rose from his seat beside her, and walked
once or twice up and down the room. He was not
angry, but there was a worn and haggard expression
on his face which was almost pitiful. She was accus-
tomed to treat him thus, and yet for a caress he
returned like a beaten dog that licked the hand which
inflicted a blow.</p>

<p><q>You have said more than once lately that you
were tired of me,</q> said he, gravely. <q>What have I
done?</q></p>

<p><q>Nothing.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, then——</q></p>

<p><q>Cannot you see that my life is one long imprison-
ment?</q> cried the girl, with sparkling eyes. <q>Do you
not add to its misery by your mad jealousy!</q></p>

<p><q>Misery!</q> murmured the young man. <q>That is
a hard word.</q></p>

<p><q>It is a true one. Do you not neglect me? Have
you ever introduced me to one of your friends? Do
you ever walk out with me? Perhaps six times we
have been for a drive, but you have always had the
blinds down, as if you were ashamed of me. I am
alone, I go out alone, I——</q></p>

<p><q>Always the same story,</q> returned Gerald, impa-
tiently. <q>As if you did not know as well as I the
reason of all this.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I know very well you are afraid lest I should
tarnish your reputation and good name,</q> she replied,
in a tone of irony.</p>

<p><q>Enough!</q> cried Delanne, stamping on the ground
as he spoke. <q>Of what do you complain? I leave
you your liberty, and you use it so well I know not
when you go out or when you come in. Do you not
know that I play for high stakes, and have to assume
a <emph>respectability</emph> even though I have it not. Could I
bring any of those with whom I mix, and to whom I
look for advancement, here? If they once saw this
luxury, this evidence of my folly, what would they
think? How would they imagine I supported this
extravagance? My reputation is all I possess. Granted
that it is all a lie, such as it is I must keep it.</q></p>

<p>He spoke excitedly, and his voice became hoarse
with the violence of his passion. Lucie saw she had
gone far enough.</p>

<p><q>You're not really angry with me, are you? Not
with me?</q> she said plaintively.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> he returned hurriedly, <q>of course not, but
you madden me with your unjust reproaches. You
say I never go out with you. Did we not go to the
opera last week?</q></p>

<p><q>I rather like that,</q> Lucie exclaimed with a laugh.
<q>Why, you know very well you allowed me to go
alone, and did not come to my box till nearly eleven.
We had supper together, it's true, but you were so
dreadfully cross I never spent such a miserable even-
ing. And let me whisper in your ear, my dear boy,
that you drank—yes—just the least drop more than
was good for you.</q></p>

<p>The young man made a gesture of impatience, and
exclaimed, <q>There, that will do! let us change the
subject.</q> He walked up to where she was standing,
and, taking her arm within his, led her to the table.</p>

<p><q>Look here, my pet, see what I have brought you,
and tell me if I am as bad as you say.</q> As he spoke
he took from his pocket the money he had borrowed
from Kraker, and laid it on the table. <q>Here is not
£100, but—— And now kiss me and say good-night,
for I shall not see you for a few days.</q></p>

<p><q>Why, are you going out of town?</q></p>

<p><q>No, but I shall be very much occupied in some
business of immense importance to me. If it turns
out all right our fortune is made, and you will see
whether I love you or not.</q></p>

<p><q>O, dearest, tell me what it is!</q></p>

<p><q>Not to-night.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, you must,</q> said she, raising herself on her
toes to bring her ear close to his lips. <q>I shall not
say good-night until you do.</q></p>

<p><q>No, no!</q> he cried laughingly, as he embraced her,
<q>because it might prove a false alarm, and then I
should be fairly scolded. Now, my darling,</q> he con-
tinued in a graver tone, <q>listen. Until the affair is
really settled don't come near me, and, as you once
had the impudence to do, don't even write. If you
do you may cause me irreparable mischief.</q></p>

<p>Lucie pouted her pretty lip. <q>Then you will not
tell me?</q> said she.</p>

<p><q>I cannot, really. You shall know in good time.</q></p>

<p><q>Another mystery, I suppose?</q> said she with a
half sigh.</p>

<p><q>It shall be the last. I swear it.</q></p>

<p>The girl looked up in his face. <q>Gerald,</q> said
she, <q>you are concealing something from me that I
have a right to know. I'm sure of it, because lately
I've noticed a change in you.</q></p>

<p><q>I swear——</q></p>

<p><q>It's no use; I shan't believe you. Now, I warn
you that if you deceive me I will be avenged.</q></p>

<p>The young man was evidently disturbed. He
turned away his head, and, without looking at her,
said—</p>

<p><q>The thing is bound to turn out well, and——</q></p>

<p><q>I don't want to hear any more about it, if you're
so disagreeable; only don't forget my warning.
There, now, kiss me, if you really must be unkind,
and leave me.</q></p>

<p>He kissed her passionately, and then with an effort
tore himself away.</p>

<p>The lady, left to herself, was not altogether the
personification of good humour. She rang her bell
furiously, scolded the servant, and finally retired to
rest in what is termed <q>a vile temper.</q> <q>If he
marries anyone for her money, I'll——,</q> she muttered;
but what she would do did not appear, nor, indeed,
had she any precise ideas on the subject.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gerald made the best of his way home.
He let himself in noiselessly, and at once proceeded
to his study. He had scarcely lit the gas before he
heard a rapid footstep in the passage, and then came
a loud tap at his door.</p>

<p><q>For God's sake, come quickly, sir.</q></p>

<p>He opened the door and saw before him the servant,
her face white with terror.</p>

<p><q>What is the matter?</q> he asked himself.</p>

<p><q>O, my poor mistress! she is dying. O, do make
haste.</q></p>

<p>Gerald did not reply, but at once hastened to his
mother's room. He found her so terribly changed he
could not restrain an exclamation of horror. She was
lying perfectly motionless, her face was of a livid
pallor, as though she had not a drop of blood in her
veins, her eyes were dull and glassy, and her hair,
once raven but now quite grey, streamed over the
pillow, and added to the ghastliness of her appear-
ance. She seemed to be quite unconscious, and did
not recognise the young man.</p>

<p><q>How long has she been like this?</q> he asked.</p>

<p><q>I don't know, sir,</q> replied the frightened girl.
<q>I was so tired I fell off into a doze, and when I
awoke I found she'd gone off like this.</q></p>

<p><q>Take a cab, and go at once for <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Cathcart. I
will stay here.</q></p>

<p>The girl hurried off, and Gerald, sinking into an
arm-chair, awaited her return. She was not long, for
the doctor, who was a friend of young Delanne, lived
near, and returned with her. He was a young man
of about Gerald's age, tall, with finely-cut features,
and a calm and decided manner. Silently greeting
his friend, he took the lamp, and approached the bed.
He gazed at the unconscious woman for a minute, and
then, turning sharply round to Gerald, said—</p>

<p><q>What has happened? I must know.</q></p>

<p>The suddenness of the question startled the young
man.</p>

<p><q>Know what?</q></p>

<p><q>Your mother has had some fright. The brain
continues its functions, but she has no power to con-
vey her ideas. It is as if the mind, active and
working, were imprisoned within a statue. This can
only be caused by a terrible
shock to the nervous system.</q></p>

<p>Gerald placed his arm within his friend's, and led
him a little distance from the bed.</p>

<p><q>You are quite right, Cathcart,</q> said he, in a low
voice, <q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne has indeed been frightened.
Indeed, I can scarcely tell you the cause.</q> He paused
for a moment, and then continued, <q>Look here,
Cathcart, I have known you for some time, and I
believe I can trust in your honour. The horrible
truth is this: <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne is not my mother. She
has disinherited me so that her own son should bene-
fit; that he should usurp my name and my fortune.
I discovered this a few days ago, and she knows I am
aware of it. Since then she has gradually sank, and
you see the result.</q></p>

<p>The young doctor heard this recital without a word.
He was used to confidences of all kinds, and, extra-
ordinary as the story was, he was not surprised;
indeed, he was only interested in it so far as it assisted
him in his diagnosis.</p>

<p><q>Has she had any pain?</q> he asked, simply.</p>

<p><q>Yes, she has complained of violent headaches, an
intolerable feeling of faintness, dulness of perception
—but, Cathcart, tell me truly,</q> said he, suddenly
off, <q>is it anything serious?</q></p>

<p><q>So serious, my dear fellow, that I know of nothing
in the range of medicine that will touch it.</q></p>

<p><q>Good heavens!</q></p>

<p><q>It would be foolish to deceive you, especially
after what you have told me of the relations between
you. Unless a miracle happens the poor creature
cannot recover.</q></p>

<head type="main"><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrest Gains Some Information</head>

<p>Eleven o'clock struck as Matthew Kraker left the
house of the Delannes. Compelled as he had been to
restrain himself, he inhaled with great vigour the
fresh air, and enjoyed the sensation of being alone
with exquisite pleasure. His first thought was to at
once go to Scotland Yard, but on reflection he remem-
bered the superintendent would more likely be found
at his private house in Camden Town, and thither he
bent his steps. In spite of the lateness of the hour
he would not ride, and determined to take his chance
of finding the official in bed. He was one of those to
whom exercise gave lucidity of idea, and as he walked
along, finding his way more by instinct than by taking
heed of the streets, the elucidation of the mysterious
crime gradually began to shape itself in his brain.</p>

<p><q>Who the deuce could have foretold such an extra-
ordinary slice of luck?</q> he soliloquised. <q>I was not
so far from the truth after all, although I did not
dream of the substitution of one child for another.
This kind of thing is so old that it was not surprising
I should have missed it; but that's always the way.
When an object's too near to the eyes it's more in-
visible than afar off. I wouldn't have lost this
evening for £100. I've scored two points, spotted
the guilty man, and helped Gerald out of his diffi-
culty. I wonder how, shrewd fellow as he is, he got
himself into such a scrape? Well, well, he'll get out
of it. But his mother—that beats everything I've
heard for some time. Truth, indeed, is stranger than
fiction.</q></p>

<p>Thus musing, he arrived at last at the house of
Superintendent Parkinson, which was in Pratt Street,
Camden Town, and rang the bell. After some little
delay a footstep was heard in the passage, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Parkinson, in shirt and trousers only, opened the door.</p>

<p><q>I had only just got into bed, but I suspected it
was you, Kraker. Come in here will you?</q></p>

<p>He showed the way into a little parlour, and lit the
gas.</p>

<p><q>Well,</q> said he, <q>you've something to tell me, I
suppose? Have you found a clue?</q></p>

<p><q>Better than that,</q> replied <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, with a
quiet smile.</p>

<p><q>The deuce you have! What?</q></p>

<p><q>Simply that I've tracked the murderer!</q></p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1881-11-12 -->




<!-- episode printed 1881-11-19 -->

<p>The superintendent started.</p>

<p><q>Already!</q> he exclaimed. <q>Impossible!</q></p>

<p><q>But quite true.</q></p>

<p><q>Then all I have to say, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, is, that you
are one of the best detectives that ever was or is
likely to be.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker smiled again.</p>

<p><q>Well,</q> said he, with a kind of modest triumph,
<q>there was a good deal of chance about it. There
always is, you know, in these things.</q></p>

<p><q>Exactly; but it is the keen man who knows how
to turn a chance to his advantage. But just tell me
all you've found out.</q></p>

<p>Clearly and without hesitation, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker went
over the scene with Gerald; and so well had he
charged his memory will all the important facts, that
he even repeated word for word certain portions of
the letters, and as an additional proof produced the
letter he had appropriated.</p>

<p><q>By Jove, Kraker, you have certainly hit upon the
right man!</q> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson, who had eagerly
drank in every word. <q>There is only one thing you
have omitted. You have not told me the name
either of the father or the son.</q></p>

<p><q>I have them,</q> replied the amateur detective
calmly. <q>Probably it will surprise you to hear that
the father who has sacrificed his legitimate to his
illegitimate son is the Earl of Annesley, and the
murderer of Matilda Rennett is no other than Vis-
count <corr>Morleigh!</corr></q></p>

<p><q>Phew!</q> said the superintendent, giving a long
whistle, <q>this is no end of a big case. For heaven's
sake, Kraker, be careful over this matter. A little
slip when nobody's concerned does not matter, but
a swell is a different affair altogether. Why, all
England will ring with it.</q></p>

<p><q>Precisely, and so more credit will redound to
Scotland Yard.</q></p>

<p><q>And to Matthew Kraker, eh?</q></p>

<p>The little man coughed. He was too modest to
acquiesce in words.</p>

<p><q>Well, and now, having gone so far, what do you
propose to do?</q> asked the superintendent.</p>

<p><q>Arrest the Viscount at once,</q> replied <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker
promptly.</p>

<p><q>No, no, that will never do. I don't doubt that
what you say is perfectly right, but I think we ought
to have just a little more evidence.</q></p>

<p><q>What more evidence do you require?</q> returned
Kraker with warmth. <q>Who has committed this
murder if he has not? Who had an interest in keep-
ing the mouth of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett closed, in destroying
her papers, her letters? No one else. My friend
Gerald, like a fool, went and warned him unconsci-
ously, and he acted immediately upon the warning.
By Jove! it was a bold stroke, and only one which a
thoroughly determined and unscrupulous man would
have taken. We haven't got a child to deal with,
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson, take my word for it.</q></p>

<p><q>That's all very well, but I think we ought to pro-
ceed with safe caution. I've seen cases before now
when presumptive evidence such as this is has totally
failed in fixing the guilt on the right person. Now,
suppose we make a mistake—why, bless my soul, I
should never get over it. I should have almost to
send in my resignation.</q></p>

<p><q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson, I declare to you solemnly that if
we delay, the chance we have will be gone. Depend
upon it that if the Viscount once has the least suspi-
cion we are upon his heels, he will take such precau-
tion as will baffle us entirely. I suppose you know
what money can do? What is to prevent him from
an <foreign xml:lang="la">alibi</foreign>? On the very night and at the very hour he
will have gone to theatre with this person, had a
game of billiards with this one, dined with someone
else, will he not? You must know this better than I.
No, our only chance is to anticipate him before he has
any time to put himself on his guard.</q></p>

<p>The superintendent was half convinced, but he was
afraid to give his consent. He rubbed his chin, looked
puzzled, but held his tongue.</p>

<p><q>Do you know what I should do if I had my will?</q>
continued Kraker. <q>I should arrest him to-night,
aye, even though he might be in bed, and should say
to him, <q>My Lord, about half-past eight on the 29th
May, you took a hansom to Hammersmith. At a few
minutes before nine you were knocking at the shutter
of a house in Water Lane. You were admitted by a
woman, of whom you asked something to eat and
drink. At twenty-five minutes past you stabbed her
between the shoulders with a broken foil, you rum-
maged the house from top to bottom, and burnt
certain papers—you know how. Then you tied up in
a sheet all the things you saw worth taking, so as to
make the affair look like a robbery, and went out,
double-locking the door behind you. When you came
to Hammersmith Bridge you threw your bundle into
the water. You took another hansom, and at eleven
you were back in town. So far you have been clever,
but you did not reckon all the possibilities. For
instance, you were wrong to wear such fashionably-
shaped boots, you should not have wore grey kid
gloves, and it was a mistake to burden yourself with a
silk hat and an umbrella. Now, confess everything,
and you shall smoke in prison some of those excellent
cigars you always smoke in a holder.</q></q></p>

<p>The superintendent was almost lost at the little
man's enthusiasm.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> said he, <q>that is all very fine, but you
know that we can do nothing of the kind. It isn't
the law.</q></p>

<p><q>No, and more's the pity,</q> rejoined <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker,
drily.</p>

<p><q>And, besides, supposing he should deny every-
thing instead of confessing?</q></p>

<p>This view of the matter had not occurred to the
amateur detective.</p>

<p><q>Oh,</q> he replied, in something like confusion,
<q>he would be bound to confess; he couldn't help
it.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not so sure. However——</q></p>

<p>But at that moment the sound of a horse's feet at
full gallop was heard in the street, and a few seconds
afterwards stopped outside the house.</p>

<p><q>A messenger from Scotland Yard,</q> exclaimed <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Parkinson. <q>Excuse me, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker.</q></p>

<p>He went to the street door and found, as he ex-
pected, a mounted constable. The latter handed him
a letter marked outside <q>Special and private. To be
forwarded at once.</q></p>

<p><q>Hallo!</q> thought the superintendent, <q>Forrest's
writing. What has he found?</q></p>

<p>He returned with the letter to Kraker, and telling
him who the missive was from, opened it, and read
the following:—</p>

<p><q>Sir,—I have to inform you that I am upon the
track of the man with the earrings. I find that he
went into a beershop near the river side on Sunday
morning previous to the Thursday, the day the mur-
der was discovered, half tipsy. He muttered a good
deal about being disappointed of some money he
expected, and afterwards went down to the river back
and got into a boat, where a companion was waiting
for him. The boat was hired from a boat builder near
Westminster Bridge, on the <choice><corr>Surrey</corr><orig>Surry</orig></choice> side. I expect
to send you more intelligence soon.—I am, yours
truly, John Forrest.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker heard the recital of this letter with a
quiet smile, and without saying a word.</p>

<p><q>Until Forrest's scent turns out unmistakeably a
false scent, I shall certainly hold my hand as to the
arrest of the Viscount,</q> said Superintendent Parkin-
son, <q>but you will probably hear from me to-morrow.</q></p>

<p><q>Very good,</q> replied Kraker. <q>We shall see who
is right, you or I.</q> And somewhat disappointedly he
bade <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson good-night, and make his way
home.</p>

<div n="11" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XI.</head>
<head type="main">Love's Young Dream</head>

<p>Of the rising men of the day, Edward Preston,
barrister-at-law, took a foremost place. He had been
wonderfully successful in two or three difficult cases,
had made an exceedingly clever speech, and had been
highly complimented by the judge. In the opinion of
most men well able to judge, a seat on the bench, if
not the woolsack, was in store for him. He was a
good-looking fellow, tall, and well-formed, with a quick,
keen intellect, and a sound judgment. Though turned
thirty, he was still a bachelor, a fact which secretly
excited some little surprise among the ladies of his
acquaintance. But naturally of a studious nature, he
had applied himself to his profession with the ardour
of a devotee, and it really never occurred to him to
get married. When, therefore, he met Florence
Dorrington, and discovered she was not like most
young ladies, that the more he saw of her the greater
pleasure he felt in her society, and that somehow he
felt less interest in law than he did formerly, it slowly
dawned upon him he was in love. He was not a man
to hesitate after he had made up his mind, and
accordingly, having settled the preliminary stage as
to his feelings towards the young lady, he at once
resolved to enter upon the next step, which was
nothing less than to make a proposal. When a man
has come to this conclusion it is, perhaps, natural he
should feel some nervousness about the way of pro-
ceeding, especially if he has not gone very far in the
process of love-making. He had seen Miss Dorring-
ton ten or twelve times; had been introduced to old
Lady Dorrington, a stately dowager, poor and proud;
and on the whole had been received favourably, but
this was all. To be on friendly terms with a lady is
a very different matter from asking her to be your
wife, and hence <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston felt some diffidence as to
how his proposition might be met. However, as we
have said, he had made up his mind; and on this
particular morning when he is introduced to the
reader, he had risen with the full determination to
bring matters to a crisis. He was much exercised in
his mind as to the set of his shirt collar, and the
colour of his necktie, for turn-down collars and scarfs
were then unknown luxuries; and somewhat agonised
at a wrinkle in his coat, and was fidgetty over his
boots. At last all was arranged to his satisfaction,
and, screwing up his courage, he set off somewhat in
the frame of mind of a soldier who is about to enter
a battle, and is uncertain whether he will come <corr>off</corr>
victorious. <q>Well,</q> said he philosophically, as he
turned out of the Temple, <q>nothing venture nothing
win. If she refuses me, why, there's an end to the
matter.</q> But, despite his philosophy, he was much
more concerned at the result of his enterprise than he
cared to own, and if the truth be told he at times
felt as if a failure would be a blow he should not get
over very soon.</p>

<p>Lady Dorrington lived in the eminently aristocratic,
slightly rural locality of Kensington, and had just
enough means to enable her to keep an expensive
house by economical expenditure in other directions.
In early youth she had been a great beauty, and among
those who had sought her hand was Viscount Mor-
leigh, afterwards Earl Annesley. A thorough coquette,
she had first led him on, and afterwards heartlessly
jilted him. He never forgave her, and when she
married Sir John Dorrington, a rich but spendthrift
baronet, he felt a malignant satisfaction in knowing
that her husband would soon run through her fortune
and his own. This indeed happened. What with
gambling and racing (a large portion of his losings, by
the way, coming into the hands of the Earl of
Annesley, who left no stone unturned to encourage
him in his waste), he found himself, after a lapse of a
few years, a comparatively poor man. Catching a
severe cold after a night of dissipation, he went into
a consumption and died, leaving his widow with one
child, who subsequently ripened into a young lady,
who, as we have seen, enchained the heart of Edward
Preston. The enmity existing between Lady Dor-
rington and the Earl had increased rather than
lessened in intensity as they grew older. She knew
well enough how her discarded lover had led her hus-
band on to gamble and bet, and she also knew his
motive for so doing. Hence, when her daughter came
home one evening from a ball, and said she had
been introduced to Viscount Morleigh, her mother
angrily bade her never to mention his name to her
again.</p>

<p>Calling a hansom, Edward bade the man drive to
Kensington, and, having arrived at his destination,
walked up the carriage drive in front of the house
with just, it must be confessed, the least atom of
trepidation.</p>

<p><q>Is Miss Dorrington within?</q> he inquired of the
servant.</p>

<p><q>No, sir, but my lady is.</q></p>

<p>This was not what he exactly wanted. It seemed
as if it took off the romance to declare his love in cold
blood, as it were, to Lady Dorrington before he was
sure of her daughter's feelings towards him, and in all
probability he would have retreated had not the lady
(the old, not the young one) suddenly entered the
hall and caught sight of him before he had time to re-
tire. Of course, he entered, and in some confusion
greeted the dowager, who received him with a stately
grace, in which perhaps there was the least tinge of
condescension. He followed her into the drawing-
room, and for some minutes they chatted on various
topics of the day. Preston, however, was ill at east,
and the conversation was, to say the truth, a little
disconnected. At last, with the air of a man who was
about to plunge into an abyss, he said—</p>

<p><q>My dear Lady Dorrington, probably you may not
guess what has really brought me here to-day,</q> and
then he awkwardly stopped.</p>

<p>Lady Dorrington raised her eye-glass to her eye,
and looked at the young man interrogatively, but said
nothing. It was not her custom to help people when
they were in difficulties.</p>

<p>Preston coughed, and went on again. Never had
he felt the difficulty in addressing a jury which he
felt now.</p>

<p><q>The truth is—and, my dear Lady Dorrington, I
wish to be perfectly open and straightforward with
you—I came here with the intention of asking your
daughter to be my wife. Forgive me if <corr>I</corr> am rather
abrupt in my utterance, but I have ever through life
tried to go straight to the point, and I do not know
why I should not do so now.</q></p>

<p>It cannot be said that the young man's declaration
did not take Lady Dorrington by <corr>surprise</corr>. She again
stared at him through her glass, and, with an air of
solemn grandeur, replied—</p>

<p><q>Really, the suddenness of your proposal, <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Preston, scarcely allows me to give you a reply. My
daughter's marriage is not a thing to be lightly settled
in a quarter-of-an-hour's conversation.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course not,</q> the young man returned hastily.
<q>I should be the last one to do so. Pray, take time.
I may also tell you that I have not mentioned the
subject to Miss Dorrington, as I thought I would con-
sult you first.</q></p>

<p><q>Exceedingly proper,</q> thought the dowager.
<q>Really, the young man seems to be well-inten-
tioned. He is of good family, and will rise, they say.
I don't know, I'm sure, what to do. I wonder what
Florence thinks about the matter? She must, I sup-
pose, have given him some encouragement, or he
would not have spoken so confidently.</q></p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1881-11-19 -->


<!-- episode printed 1881-11-26 -->

<p>While Lady Dorrington thus reflected Edward
Preston sat in a state of great anxiety. Why did she
not speak and end the matter one way or the other.
He was naturally impetuous, and though the verdict
might go against him he would sooner hear it than be
kept in suspense.</p>

<p><q>Well, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston,</q> she returned, after a long
pause, <q>I cannot, of course, control my daughter's
feelings in such an important matter; but I may tell
you, as far as I am concerned, you have my consent.</q></p>

<p><q>A thousand thanks, my dear Lady Dorrington,</q>
he exclaimed joyfully. <q>You have made me very
happy now that I can go confidently to Miss Dorring-
ton and say what I have said to you.</q></p>

<p>In the exuberance of his spirits he kissed the lady's
hand, and, snatching up his hat, bade her adieu.</p>

<p>Left alone Lady Dorrington thought seriously over
the announcement just made to her, and the more she
thought the more she was inclined to the opinion that
the match was one to be encouraged. She would have
liked a title as well as wealth; but, forced to make a
choice between the two, she would certainly have
chosen the latter. Preston, however, was cousin to
an earl, so that there was a prospect of a combination
of the two.</p>

<p>In about an hour her daughter came in. She was a
tall, graceful girl, not what one would at first sight
term pretty, but with an expressive face which
strangely gained upon you the more you knew her.</p>

<p><q>Who do you think has called, Florence?</q> said
Lady Dorrington with a smile, as they sat together at
luncheon.</p>

<p><q>How can I possibly tell, mamma?</q></p>

<p><q>I thought you might guess,</q> replied the older
lady, significantly. <q>Some one who inquired very
particularly after you—<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston.</q></p>

<p><q>Very kind of him, I am sure,</q> returned Florence
carelessly.</p>

<p>She spoke in an indifferent tone, and her mother
was much puzzled to tell whether her indifference was
real or assumed.</p>

<p><q>Yes; and can you imagine what his errand was?</q></p>

<p><q>No, that I cannot, unless it was to bring me some
dreadful heavy book. I don't believe the man ever
read anything of a more frivolous nature than Black-
stone,</q> and the young lady laughed a merry laugh.</p>

<p>Lady Dorrington looked serious. This was not
exactly the reply she expected. Evidently, whatever
the young man might have fancied, Florence did not
seem very desperately in love. But then the feminine
nature in matters of this kind is so self-deceptive.
No, there was nothing to be deduced from this tone
of indifference, and again Lady Dorrington went on—</p>

<p><q>I don't know how far you have encouraged him,
but he is deeply in love with you, my dear.</q></p>

<p>Florence opened her eyes wide, and a blush suffused
her cheek.</p>

<p><q>With me, mamma? What nonsense! Why, I
have never encouraged him in the least. Indeed, to
tell you the truth, I have always thought him just
the least bit of a bore.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, he seems to be fascinated, and what is more,
he has asked my consent.</q></p>

<p><q>Mamma!</q> exclaimed the young lady half pained
and half offended, <q>he must really be mad. I have
never thought of him excepting as a mere acquaint-
ance. Of course you said no?</q></p>

<p><q>On the contrary,</q> replied her mother calmly, <q>I
said yes. He is very well off, apart from his profes-
sion; he is a gentleman and well connected. You
know, if his cousin, Lord Pounceford, dies, the title
and estate come to him.</q></p>

<p><q>But I do not care for him; and besides, if he
really had the intention of marrying he surely might
have spoken to me first. It is exceedingly disagree-
able receiving a proposal through a third person,</q> and
this time Flora's tone was decidedly one of anger.</p>

<p><q>Really, Florence, I think you might be more re-
spectful. I am not quite accustomed to be called a
<q>third person,</q></q> returned the dowager in some state-
liness.</p>

<p><q>I beg your pardon; but the idea of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston
wanting to marry me and setting about it so sharply
is so irritating, I hope you will write at once and
put everything straight. He must never come here
again.</q></p>

<p><q>My dear Florence, I do not understand your
objection to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston. Besides, I have given him
my word. I can hardly go back.</q></p>

<p><q>But, mamma, he does not want to marry you.
As I was not asked, I do not see that what you may
have said is at all binding. I don't want to give you
pain, or go against your wishes, but I cannot marry
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston; and if you do not write I must. It
would be very wrong to let him go on under a false
impression.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't think he will give you up as easily as you
imagine. He has my consent entirely, and I think
you ought to pay some little attention to my opinion.
You know very well that when I die my income dies
too, and it is such a great thing for a girl to marry
well. You will seriously annoy me if you reject
him.</q></p>

<p>Lady Dorrington spoke in a voice of displeasure,
and Florence knew she meant what she said. <q>Oh,</q>
she thought, <q>why was I not at home when <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Preston called? A word from me would have saved
all this, and now I shall never have any peace.</q> But
it was no use temporising, and indeed, Florence had
too much of her mother's temper in her to think of
doing so. She rose from her seat, and, with a look of
trouble on her brow, said—</p>

<p><q>Well, mamma, I assume, from what you have
said, that you do not intend to undeceive <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pres-
ton. It is, as you must know, a painful and embar-
rassing thing for me to do, but I cannot help it. I
shall certainly write to him this afternoon.</q> And so
saying, she swept out of the room.</p>

<p>The next morning Edward Preston sat at his break-
fast table a disappointed and dismal man. By his
empty plate—for he could eat nothing—lay an open
letter in a lady's handwriting, and the deathblow to
all his hopes for the hand of Florence Dorrington.</p>

</div>



<div n="12" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XII.</head>
<head type="main">Father and Son.</head>

<p>On the day when <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker made his minute
examination at Ivy Cottage, and almost at the same
hour, Viscount Morleigh got into his carriage for the
purpose of meeting his father, whom he expected
from Paris. The young man was paler than was his
wont. His eyes looked heavy, his cheeks blanched,
and he threw himself back in his seat with an air of
extreme weariness. This was not his usual appear-
ance; indeed, as a rule, he was active and full of
high spirits, but for the last three days, as the ser-
vants had remarked, he had not been like his ordinary
self. Irritability, loss of appetite, and long intervals
of silence had taken the place of good humour, a
healthy hunger, and talkativeness. His valet, who
had been with him a number of years, was much
concerned, and, thinking he was ill, tried to persuade
him not to go out. But the Earl, who had an elastic
conscience as far as any fashionable vices were con-
cerned, and who would readily have pardoned any
folly of extravagance, was punctilious to a fault in
regard to the respect he considered was due to him-
self. As proud as Lucifer, he rarely overlooked any
slight, even when unintentionally committed. He
telegraphed to his son that he should be at London
Bridge at a certain time, and no more doubted that
his son would be there to meet him than he did that
the train would convey him in safety. The Viscount
knew this well, and accordingly was on the platform
when the train arrived. The Earl got out of the
carriage and greeted his son more politely than
warmly. He was a tall, fine-looking man, with a
military bearing, and an unmistakeably aristocratic
air. Pride of birth was written in every line of his
handsome though stern face, and though he had been
clad in rags, he would yet have been called a gentle-
man.</p>

<p><q>Are you quite well, sir?</q> asked the young man,
with a certain constraint in his manner.</p>

<p><q>Yes, pretty well, Frank, but confoundedly tired.
A good dinner and a glass of the old Burgundy will
soon pick me up. Eh! what the deuce have you been
doing with yourself, man?</q> said he, suddenly noticing
the Viscount's altered looks.</p>

<p><q>Nothing; caught cold I fancy.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah! must get rid of that.</q></p>

<p>By this time they were in the carriage and rolling
swiftly towards Chester Square. They did not con-
verse very much, for the Earl, besides being tired, had
not succeeded very well in his mission, which was of
a diplomatic nature, and altogether he was in a bad
temper. However, the sight of the dinner restored
him, and, being somewhat of a gourmand, he gradu-
ally mellowed and recovered his wonted equanimity.
When the desert was over, and they were discussing
coffee and cigars, he was deep in politics, taking a
strong Conservative view of everything, and denounc-
ing the absurdity of the common people expecting to
have a voice in the government of the country.</p>

<p><q>Government can only come from one class, those
with good blood in their veins. Depend upon it, no
others can last.</q></p>

<p><q>But is intellect confined to the class you speak of?</q></p>

<p><q>No; but government does not require intellect.</q></p>

<p><q>I tell you I am right, and I have studied this
question deeply.</q></p>

<p>The Viscount was silent, knowing by experience
that the best way was to let the Earl go on uncon-
tradicted.</p>

<p><q>Yes, I repeat that if the upper classes wish to
retain their power, they must take as much pains to
keep the breed pure as they do that of their horses.
And that brings me to a subject upon which I have
been going to speak to you for some time—your mar-
riage, Frank.</q></p>

<p><q>I am much obliged, my lord, but I am in no very
great hurry, and this event might very well stand over
for a little time.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't think so,</q> replied the Earl lightly. <q>An-
other cigar. You are now thirty, and I fancy you
have sown your wild oats. You have not been more
extravagant than most young men, though, perhaps,
that is not saying very much, and it's time you were
settled. I've had some talk with the Duke or Har-
ford on the subject.</q></p>

<p><q>Pardon me, my lord, but I really think this is a
matter upon which I, at least, ought to know my own
mind. I say it will all respect, but I cannot be a
party to any arrangement as to my marriage which
you may have made without speaking first to me.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't be a fool, Morleigh,</q> broke out the Earl;
<q>you know very well I always gave you to under-
stand that your marriage with Lady Mary was the
devout wish of my heart. The Annesley and Harford
estates joined together would make a property un-
equalled in all England. Of course, I shouldn't do
anything in the matter without consulting you; but,
on the other hand, knowing as you do my wishes, you
will not thwart me.</q></p>

<p><q>Thwart is a disagreeable word, and one which
you should not have used; but, with regard to Lady
Mary, I may say at once that I cannot marry her.</q></p>

<p><q>The deuce you can't? And why, pray?</q></p>

<p><q>Simply because I am engaged to some one else.</q></p>

<p>The Earl threw himself back in his chair, and gazed
at his son in utter astonishment.</p>

<p><q>Engaged! And without telling me? Impossible!
You must be joking,</q> he said at last. <q>If you mean
that you have entangled yourself anywhere for the
sake of a pretty face, why that can be easily got over,
but engaged is too ridiculous.</q></p>

<p><q>Nevertheless, it is true.</q></p>

<p><q>Frank,</q> stormed the Earl, <q>if you marry beneath
your rank I will never forgive you!</q></p>

<p><q>My rank is that which I make myself.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I see. And where, pray, have you picked up
these fine sentiments? Really, I begin to think that
you're rather vulgar in your notions for the son of
an earl.</q></p>

<p><q>And if I am, my lord, perhaps there are good
reasons for my being so.</q></p>

<p>The look and accent with which the Viscount
accompanied these words were so prominent and full
of meaning that the Earl started. In a hesitating
voice he asked, <q>What did you say?</q></p>

<p>Directly Viscount Morleigh had let fall the words
he regretted his hastiness. But he had gone too far
to draw back.</p>

<p><q>I have something very serious to tell you, sir,</q> he
replied with a certain embarrassment. <q>Not only
my honour but yours, and that of our name, is at
stake. I had made up my mind to have an explana-
tion with you, but I did not intend to trouble you
with it on the evening of your return. However,
there is no help for it.</q></p>

<p>The Earl listened to his son's words with an ill-
concealed anxiety. One would almost have said that
he divined what was coming.</p>

<p><q>Of all men in the world,</q> resumed the Viscount,
<q>I have the least right to reproach you: your
liberality, your——</q></p>

<p><q>Enough,</q> broke in his father impatiently. <q>Say
what you have to say at once.</q></p>

<p>The young man bowed. Then, fixing his eyes on his
father's face, he said—</p>

<p><q>In your absence I have seen all your correspon-
dence with Louisa Delanne. All,</q> he added,
significantly.</p>

<p>The Earl did not give his son time to finish. He
started as if a serpent had stung him, and so violently
that he pushed the chair on which he was sitting
several inches from the table.</p>

<p><q>Not a word,</q> he cried in a terrible voice. <q>Not
one syllable, I forbid you.</q></p>

<p>But the next moment he seemed ashamed of his
vehemence, and, recovering his calmness by a violent
effort, he poured out a glass of wine, and swallowed
it at one gulp.</p>

<p><q>I knew by your face, directly I saw you at the
railway station, that something had happened.</q></p>

<!-- episode printed 1881-12-03 -->

<p>There was a long silence, each scarcely daring to
reopen a conversation fraught with such terrible
meaning to them both. With his head half averted, the
Earl pondered over the revelation which had burst
upon him like a thunderbolt. Perhaps, if the truth
be told, it had more irritated than surprised him.
He knew well enough that such a secret, however
carefully guarded, was very likely sooner or later to
be brought to light. Three persons had it in their
keeping; besides which he had been imprudent
enough to commit it to paper. He could scarcely
believe, looking at the affair by the light of experi-
ence, and with the eyes of a diplomatist, how he
could have been so foolish, and how, having once
written that which would <corr>compromise</corr> him, he had not
taken the precaution to destroy the evidence. But
what man would ever think of taking precautions
against the woman of whom he was enamoured? So
much was he in love with Louisa Delanne, that he
would never have dreamt of asking for his letters,
though the time had come when he had quarrelled
with her, and they had parted. And yet many a
time during the twenty years he had not seen her he
had again and again cursed the inexcusable folly of
his passion. In his imagination the sword of Damocles
was always suspended over his head, and to-day it had
descended. These thoughts ran like wildfire through
his brain, and agitated him beyond endurance. At
last he said, without altering his attitude, and in a
cold, hard voice—</p>

<p><q>Viscount Morleigh, between us now there need be
no reticence. What have you seen of these letters
you speak of?</q></p>

<p>During the silence the Viscount had had time to
collect his thoughts, and prepare himself for the
struggle which for four days he had awaited with so
much patience. In a few words, and keeping strictly
to the facts, he told his father of Gerald's visit, and
of the letters he had shown him.</p>

<p><q>And you did not kick the fellow out?</q> inquired
the Earl fiercely.</p>

<p><q>That was my first impulse, I confess, but at the first
glance I recognised your handwriting, and I took the
letters and read them.</q></p>

<p><q>And then?</q> inquired the Earl with something like
a sneer.</p>

<p><q>And then I returned the packet, and told <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Delanne he should hear from me in a week's time. I
did this because I felt it necessary to consult you in
the matter. Now, I must ask you one thing: Did
this substitution really take place—that is to say, am
I the nameless son of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne and yourself?</q></p>

<p><q>Unhappily, yes,</q> returned the latter, in a low
voice. <q>You have read these letters—what they
contain is true.</q></p>

<p>The Viscount heard the reply in silence, and then
observed calmly—</p>

<p><q>I at first thought it was probable, but on thinking
over the matter I noticed one curious circumstance.
All the letters I have seen speak only of your inten-
tion to effect the change. They give directions in
minute detail, but there is not a word to prove that
they were carried into effect.</q></p>

<p>The Earl looked at his son in surprise. What he
had written was still fresh in his memory, and he
could well recall some expressions of satisfaction at
the success of his plan, and thanking Louisa for having
attended so well to his orders.</p>

<p><q>You cannot have read the whole,</q> he murmured.</p>

<p><q>You are mistaken, my lord,</q> returned the young
man, steadily. <q>I read every one, and with an atten-
tion which I fancy you can well understand. I repeat
that the last letter shown me was one in which <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Delanne announces the arrival of Matilda Rennett,
the nurse who had been entrusted with the changing
of the children. I know nothing beyond that.</q></p>

<p>A new light broke in upon the Earl. Was it not an
everyday occurrence for a man to conceive a project,
think it over a long time, hug it to his breast, and
then at the last moment abandon it? He bit his lips
with vexation to think how he had been so precipi-
tate. The Viscount had commenced by having
suspicions, and he had changed them into certainties
by his awkwardness.</p>

<p><q>I can see what has happened,</q> he thought.
<q>Louisa has destroyed those letters which she thought
were the most compromising. But why should she
preserve the others? That is what puzzles me?</q></p>

<p>He took a sudden resolution.</p>

<p><q>Frank,</q> said he, in an affectionate tone, <q>sit
down here near me, and let us talk over this matter.
We must not deceive each other, but rather unite to
prevent a great, a terrible misfortune. The name of
our house is yet untarnished. Let me not, through
you, be the first to bring dishonour upon it. Speak
to me in all confidence, as a son should to his father.
Have you fixed upon any plan? Have you come to
any determination?</q></p>

<p>The Earl spoke in a tone of almost piteous entreaty,
and without a word the Viscount obeyed him. After
a pause, the young man said quietly—</p>

<p><q>It seems to me, my lord, that there is but one
course possible.</q></p>

<p><q>And what is that?</q></p>

<p><q>Before your legitimate son I must yield. If both
you and he are agreed I can say nothing—do nothing.</q></p>

<p>The Earl could scarcely restrain himself at this re-
ply. Striking the table furiously, he exclaimed—</p>

<p><q>Are you mad? Who has said we are agreed? I
have never seen this man, and I have not the least
desire to do so. I disown him. I have made you
Viscount Morleigh and my heir, and, by heaven, sir!
you shall be—at least until my death.</q></p>

<p><q>But——</q></p>

<p><q>Silence! What has it to do with you if I declare
it is my will that you should succeed me? It's all
very well to be chivalrous, self-denying, and the rest
of it in books, but, sir, it won't do in real life. Just
think of the shame, the exposure! By heaven! I
should never get over it.</q></p>

<p>And the Earl wiped his damp brow and continued—</p>

<p><q>If we were Smiths or Browns such a thing
wouldn't matter a rap; but, in our station, it is a far
different matter. God bless me, Frank, you must
know that.</q></p>

<p><q>I have thought of all this,</q> said he; <q>but I say
again that conscience——</q></p>

<p><q>Conscience—fiddlestick! Conscience is a thing
which always intrudes when it is not wanted. Who
has committed the fault? Not you. I alone have a
right to speak of conscience, and I accept the respon-
sibility.</q></p>

<p><q>This Delanne will assert his rights, if I am not
mistaken.</q></p>

<p><q>What of that? He has no proof.</q></p>

<p><q>Your own letters.</q></p>

<p><q>They are not decisive. Have you not said so
yourself?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, but they convinced me in spite of that, and,
as I am the person most interested, my opinion is
worth something. Besides, will he not find witnesses?</q></p>

<p><q>Whom can he find?</q></p>

<p><q>Yourself. I do not see how you can get out of it
unless you commit perjury.</q></p>

<p>At this very natural conclusion the face of the Earl
became almost livid, and he gasped for breath.</p>

<p><q>Whatever comes, I'll not let the name of Annesley
be sullied.</q></p>

<p><q>Then there is <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne,</q> went on the Vis-
count, not a muscle of his face moving.</p>

<p><q>Oh, I can answer for her. <emph>Her</emph> interest is ours.
Can you not see that? Would a mother give up her
son for another? It is not in nature.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah!</q> replied the young man, drily. <q>And Matilda
Rennett? Will she also hold her tongue?</q></p>

<p><q>If she is sufficiently paid—yes.</q></p>

<p><q>True; but there are awkward points that, if a
certain sum will close her mouth, a large one might
possibly open it.</q></p>

<p><q>I know how to quiet her,</q> muttered the Earl
between his teeth.</p>

<p><q>By the way,</q> said the Viscount, musing, <q>she
was the nurse of Delanne. I wonder if it is she who
has put him on the track of this correspondence? He
spoke of her as if he were certain of her testimony.</q></p>

<p><q>I only wish she were dead instead of old Taplow.
He, at all events, could be relied upon,</q> returned the
Earl, in a tone of suppressed anger.</p>

<p><q>You see that Matilda Rennett, if she chooses,
can at once upset all your plans,</q> remarked the young
man, significantly.</p>

<p>His father was silent. He saw the full force of the
remark, and for the moment it paralysed his ener-
gies. He could say nothing, and silence reigned in
the room.</p>

<p>The Viscount was the first to break it.</p>

<p><q>Returning to the subject which inadvertently led
to our present conversation, I think we broke off just
at the point when I declared I could not accept the
hand of Lady Mary Harford.</q></p>

<p><q>What is that to me just now? Let us see a way
out of our present difficulty first.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, as to that, I have, as I have told you, made
up my mind on the point. I am convinced that the
proper thing to do is to give up my position, which is
an utterly false one, to Delanne.</q></p>

<p><q>Dolt and idiot!</q> hissed the Earl.</p>

<p><q>That I have resolved upon doing unless——</q></p>

<p><q>Unless what?</q> demanded his father quickly.</p>

<p><q>Unless you consent to my marriage with Florence.</q></p>

<p><q>What! would you wed the daughter of the wo-
man who deceived your father?</q></p>

<p><q>Surely she is not to blame for that, father.</q>
Curiously enough, it was the only time the young man
addressed the Earl by his name during the interview.
<q>I love Florence, and she, I believe, loves me. Her
mother is as averse to the union as you can possibly
be, but for all that we have resolved to be married.
You see, I have been perfectly frank with you, and I
again say that I consent to keep your fault from the
world on the sole condition that you do not oppose my
marriage.</q></p>

<p>The Earl's countenance became almost distorted as
the varying emotions of rage and disappointment
passed over it. He rose from his chair, and paced up
and down the room, and the heaving of his chest
showed how intense was the struggle going on within.
At last he came up to where the young man, calm as
a statue, sat awaiting his answer, and put his hand on
his son's shoulder.</p>

<p><q>Viscount Morleigh,</q> said he, in a strangely altered
voice, <q>you have taken a cruel advantage of your
father, sir. You have conquered. I consent.</q></p>

<p>A smile of triumph passed over the young man's
face. Rising, he bade his father good night in his
wonted respectful manner, and left the room.</p>

<head type="num">Chapter XIII.</head>
<head type="main">The Arrest.</head>

<p>Two days went over, and during that time neither
father nor son alluded to their conversation. They
met at dinner, but the Earl was as cold as ice, and,
beyond a few ordinary remarks, nothing passed be-
tween them. The young man was occupied each
morning with writing, in the afternoon he rode in the
Park, and after dinner again retired to his room. On
the evening of the second day two men knocked at
the door of the house in Chester Square, and inquired
if Viscount Morleigh was at home.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> was replied by the footman, <q>but engaged.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah,</q> replied the shorter of the men, drily, <q>you
will, if you please, tell him that we wish to see him
on most important business.</q></p>

<p>There was something in the tone, quiet as it was,
that carried authority with it, and the servant
obeyed.</p>

<p>They found the young man seated at a writing
table in the room previously mentioned, the walls of
which were covered with weapons of different kinds.
He looked up as they entered, and quietly motioned
for them to be seated. They did not, however, obey,
but walked up to him.</p>

<p><q>My lord,</q> began the smaller of the two men, <q>we
have come upon a rather unpleasant errand.</q></p>

<p>Viscount Morleigh turned round suddenly at these
words and faced the speaker, but said nothing.</p>

<p><q>It is no use beating about the bush,</q> went on <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Kraker (for, as the reader may already have guessed,
it was he). <q>The fact is, my lord, we are detective
police officers, and we have a warrant for your appre-
hension.</q></p>

<p>The young man started, and the pen fell from his
nerveless fingers.</p>

<p><q>For the murder of Matilda Rennett, at Hammer-
smith, on Tuesday, the 25th of May,</q> continued <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Kraker, in a cold, mechanical voice.</p>

<p><q>What—what can you mean? I the murderer of
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett? You must be mad.</q></p>

<p><q>There is the warrant.</q></p>

<p>Viscount Morleigh glanced at the document, and
the colour fled from his cheek and lips. A perspira-
tion bedewed his forehead, and his eyes were wild and
staring.</p>

<p><q>Great heaven,</q> he muttered, <q>this is some hor-
rible nightmare! Matilda Rennett dead? Then I
am lost.</q></p>

<p>The words were uttered in a low tone, but they did
not escape the acute ear of Matthew Kraker. He in-
wardly chuckled to himself at the singular verification
of his surmise.</p>

<p>With a ghastly attempt at calmness, the young man
said—</p>

<p><q>I presume you wish me to accompany you?</q></p>

<p>Matthew Kraker bowed.</p>

<p><q>I have a cab waiting,</q> he returned. <q>Thompson,</q>
he added, turning to the man who was with him,
<q>you will accompany his lordship downstairs. I have
some business to do here.</q></p>

<p>Viscount Morleigh heard all as if he were in a kind
of stupor, and it was only when the man touched his
arm that he recovered his consciousness.</p>

<p><q>Does—does my father know of this?</q> he inquired.</p>

<p><q>No, my lord. If you wish to write to him you
are at liberty to do so.</q></p>

<p>The young man thought for a moment.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> he said, hurriedly, <q>he will know it soon
enough. I am simply the victim of an unfortunate
mistake; that is all.</q> And then, after a pause, he
continued, <q>I should like, though, to write a few
lines to—to another person.</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly,</q> replied <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker; <q>but I must see
the note before it is sent off.</q></p>

<p>The Viscount contracted his brows, and said
haughtily—</p>

<p><q>I am not accustomed to have my correspondence
overlooked by a third person.</q></p>

<p><q>Probably not,</q> replied the detective, quietly,
<q>but in this instance, my lord, you will have to do so.
Our duty leaves me no alternative.</q></p>

<p>Viscount Morleigh did not reply, but, sitting down
to the table, wrote a line or two on a sheet of paper,
and tossed it over to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker. The note ran as
follows:</p>

<p><q>My Dearest F——,—Do not be alarmed at any-
thing you may have heard about me. I am sadly
beset, but all will come right. As this will be read
by the police I can say no more.—Faithfully yours,
Frank.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker read this, and handed it again to the
Viscount, who placed it in an envelope and directed
it, and without another word he accompanied the
officer out of the room, leaving <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker in an
attitude of extreme watchfulness.</p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1881-12-03 -->


<!-- episode printed 1881-12-10 -->

<p><q>By Jove!</q> murmured the latter, <q>if it is not the
neatest take I have had for many a long day. Now,
it only remains for me to complete the evidence, and
all is done.</q> He glanced at the walls. <q>Ah,</q> he
muttered, <q>foils.</q> He examined them narrowly.
There were many of them, and they were of different
sizes. His lordship was evidently passionately fond
of fencing. But <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker was disappointed; what
he sought for was not there. Suddenly his eyes bright-
ended. <q>I knew I was not mistaken,</q> he exclaimed,
as he leaped across the floor by a series of little
jumps. The next moment he held up in triumph a
foil, about ten inches of which had been broken off.</p>

<p>Quickly as the capture was effected a sensation diffi-
cult to be described went through the household. The
footmen in the hall saw the young lord, with the
strange man by his side, pass them without appearing
to notice their presence. The cab into which they
got drove rapidly off, and though nothing was said as
to the reason of the unusual proceeding, they instinc-
tively felt that it was but the prelude to something
terrible.</p>

<p><q>What's hup?</q> said the footman to the porter.</p>

<p><q>Blest if I know,</q> replied the latter.</p>

<p>They were startled by the sound of a bell clanging
through the house.</p>

<p><q>Why, that's my lord's bell, safe as 'ouses,</q> said
the footman, turning pale, for he had forgotten the
strange visitors were two in number, and his first
thought was that the bell was wrung by some ghostly
occupant of the chamber.</p>

<p><q>Of course it is. Isn't there one of 'em left be-
hind? It's the rummest thing hever <emph>I</emph> heard.</q></p>

<p>And the porter blew his nose violently, with an air
of profound wisdom, and as if he had all through his
life been accustomed to hear <soCalled>rum</soCalled> things.</p>

<p>In the meantime <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker's summons had brought
to the room the Viscount's valet.</p>

<p><q>You are his lordship's man, I suppose?</q> said the
amateur detective, sharply.</p>

<p><q>Yes; but I don't see what it has to do with you.</q></p>

<p><q>No, not much; but I want your assistance in a
little matter—simply to show me his lordship's ward-
robe.</q></p>

<p>The man stared.</p>

<p><q>Hang it! I like your impudence.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you? Most people don't, but it's a matter of
taste. This door, I fancy, leads to the Viscount's
bedroom? Nothing like having one's rooms on a floor
—I've got 'em myself.</q></p>

<p>Again the valet looked bewildered. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker's
coolness almost took his breath away.</p>

<p><q>I don't know who you may be, mister, but allow
me to tell you that I shall do nothing of the kind.</q></p>

<p><q>Quite right, quite right. But, just to make every-
thing nice and comfortable, I may as well tell you
that I am a detective officer, and that his lordship is
by this time comfortably lodged in Marlborough Police
Station.</q></p>

<p>The man's jaw fell, and his manner changed in-
stantly.</p>

<p><q>I beg your pardon, sir. I didn't know, I'm sure.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well; now that you do know, please accom-
pany me into the bedroom I see yonder.</q></p>

<p>The man obeyed, and looked on in amazement while
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker deftly examined the drawers, turned over
the bed, and peered in the cupboards, all the while
making a running commentary upon his own proceed-
ings in an undertone. Occasionally he asked a ques-
tion or two of the valet as to his master's habits, and
often refreshed himself with a pinch of snuff from an
enormous box which he carried.</p>

<p><q>Hum!</q> said he, at last, <q>not very much here.
Now for the dressing room. You are a methodical
man, I suppose, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Valet, and brush your masters'
clothes regularly, eh?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, sir, pretty regular.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, here is the wardrobe. Very good. Not a bad
choice of vests. Yes, that's a good coat; one of
Poole's, I'll swear. A whole host of trousers, and all
nicely kept. Hallo, what's this?</q></p>

<p>As he spoke he took from the bottom of the ward-
robe, where they had been thrown carelessly, a pair of
black cloth trousers. The ends were specked with a
gravelly mud, and were still damp. The wearer must
have been out on a very wet night, evidently. On
one knee was a greenish mark, as of moss, and there
was a little rent close to the mark. In the pocket of
the trousers was a pair of grey kid gloves, the palm of
one having marks of moss similar to the one on the
trousers; the ends of the fingers were frayed and
rough, and from the back some fragments of the sur-
face had been picked. In addition was a pair of thin-
soled boots, very muddy, and an umbrella still moist.</p>

<p><q>Oh, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Valet, I'm afraid you are not so metho-
dical as you would like me to believe,</q> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Kraker, as he drew out one by one the articles.</p>

<p><q>I don't know anything about those things. It is
the first time I've seen them.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker lifted his eyebrows in surprise, and
looked keenly at the valet.</p>

<p><q>The deuce!</q> he thought; <q>I don't believe the
fellow's speaking the truth.</q></p>

<p><q>The only way I can account for them being so was
one night last week when my lord allowed me a holi-
day until the next day.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah! on what night was that?</q></p>

<p>The valet thought for a moment.</p>

<p><q>It was Tuesday, the 25th,</q> he returned, after a
pause.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker nodded. He had expected the answer.
His errand was accomplished. He had already pos-
sessed himself of the broken foil, a cigar holder he
had found among some trifles in the other room, and
now, with the trousers, the umbrella, and the gloves,
the chain of evidence was complete. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker
went away perfectly satisfied with his evening's work.
As was his wont when at all excited, he sought re-
lief in walking, and though he was anxious to impart
the important information he had gained to Super-
intendent Parkinson, a cab was not to be thought of,
and so he set off at a smart pace to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Chance enters into life, and guides circumstances
much more than some believe, and thus it was that
chance threw <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker against Edward Preston,
who was strolling in <abbr>St.</abbr> James's Park, and with the
assistance of a cigar was endeavouring to battle against
his disappointed love, which in spite of what he could
do still rankled in his heart.</p>

<p><q>Well, Kraker, you creeper into other men's secrets,
what's in the wind now? Any big case on?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, indeed, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston,</q> returned the little
man, with one of his inward chuckles. <q>It's about
the biggest we've had for a long time. And there's a
tinge of romance about it, too, which quite lifts it out
of the ranks of ordinary crime.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, there's a woman in it, I suppose?</q></p>

<p><q>Of course; that goes without saying—in fact, it's
a woman who's murdered.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, it's a murder, is it?</q> returned Preston care-
lessly.</p>

<p><q>Yes. If you've got time I should like to tell you
something about it. We don't often meet with such
an extraordinary chain of evidence. Of course, I
wouldn't tell everybody; but you're almost one of us,
you know, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank you for the honour.</q></p>

<p>Kraker took his careless tone for one of acqui-
escence, and forthwith commenced his story, repressing,
with the exception of that of the murdered, all re-
ference to names. Preston at first listened languidly,
but as Kraker warmed with the relation, and imparted
to the horrible tale a certain amount of dramatic
energy, his interest began to increase, and at last he
became almost as excited as the detective himself.</p>

<p><q>By Jove, Kraker, you're a genius! But what an
extraordinary—what a romantic story.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, isn't it? But now I must say good-night,
for I want to get to Scotland Yard.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't let me detain you. I shall look with in-
terest for the end of this business.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, there's a good deal to come out of it, you may
depend upon it.</q></p>

<p>After Kraker had gone, Edward slowly sauntered
down Parliament Street to the Strand, the frightful
recital of Matthew Kraker still vivid in his brain.
He reached his chambers in the Temple, smoked
another cigar and tried to read, but all to no purpose;
the image of the murdered woman would persist in
presenting itself before him, and each detail of the
hideous crime, given, as it had been, with so much
minuteness by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, came before him with
dismal pertinacity. Never had he passed so miser-
able a night. However, occupied as he was by busi-
ness, he quite forgot the affair on the following day,
and it was only on glancing at the evening paper at
his club that his recollection was again called to it by
seeing a paragraph headed <q>The Hammersmith
Mystery. Arrest of the Supposed Murderer.</q></p>

<p><q>The Hammersmith Mystery,</q> he muttered. <q>Why,
that must be the business Kraker was so full of.</q></p>

<p>The paragraph ran as follows:—</p>

<p><q>At length the police have succeeded in obtaining
a clue to the perpetrator of this most mysterious
crime. The evidence which will be forthcoming is
stated to be of the most startling character, and
seriously involves a member of the aristocracy. As
the arrest was made last night, there is no necessity
to conceal the fact that the person implicated is
Viscount Morleigh, son of the Earl of Annesley. He
will be brought up before the magistrates to-morrow
morning.</q></p>

<p><q>The deuce!</q> thought Edward Preston, <q>this is a
singular affair. Kraker certainly did not overrate its
importance.</q></p>

<p>The talk at the club that evening was, of course, of
the murder and its extraordinary sequel, but Preston,
though he knew a good deal more than anyone else,
did not join in it. That the guilt had been fixed on
the right person he had not the slightest doubt, and
he felt a curious pleasure in listening to the specula-
tions more or less absurd in which the talkers, many
of whom were acquainted with the Viscount, indulged.
The next morning, about nine o'clock, when he was in
the midst of his work—he was an early riser, and,
summer time as it was, he had finished his breakfast
by eight o'clock—one of his clerks tapped at the door.</p>

<p><q>What is it, Fermor?</q> he called out.</p>

<p><q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> <corr>Rabbits</corr>, sir, wishes to see you.</q></p>

<p>Now, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <corr>Rabbits</corr> was one of the Treasury
solicitors.</p>

</div>



<div n="14" type="chapter">

<head type="num">Chapter XIV.</head>
<head type="main">Edward Preston is Puzzled.</head>

<p><q>Good morning, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston, good morning, sir.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, good morning, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rabbits.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rabbits, of the firm of Pocock and Rabbits,
solicitors, was a neatly-dressed, brisk, dapper little
man, cleanly shaved, and always in a preternatural
state of sharpness. He was about fifty, with iron-
grey whiskers, and crisp curly hair, once black, but
now beginning to be silvered. He spoke in a quick,
jerky utterance, as if he had not a moment to lose in
unnecessary conversation.</p>

<p><q>Glad I've found you in, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston. Rather a
big case on, and wants to be dealt with delicately.</q></p>

<p><q>Indeed. Criminal business, of course?</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rabbits nodded.</p>

<p><q>Daresay you've seen something of the affair in the
papers. Everybody's talking about it, and I tell you
what, sir, it's one of the most extraordinary affairs
that I've met with in the whole course of my experi-
ence,</q> and the little man took a pinch of snuff with
an air of immense satisfaction.</p>

<p><q>Ah,</q> returned <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston, eagerly. <q>Forgery, I
suppose?</q></p>

<p><q>No; murder.</q></p>

<p>The young barrister dropped his pen.</p>

<p><q>You don't mean the Rennett affair, do you?</q></p>

<p><q>You've hit it, sir.</q></p>

<p><q>How extraordinary! Why, I know something of
the horrible business already,</q> ejaculated <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston.</p>

<p><q>So much the better. The case comes on this
afternoon, at two o'clock; so, if you please, we'll at
once go into it.</q></p>

<p>And for half-an-hour the two professional gentle-
men were closeted, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rabbits giving the barrister
all the information he at present possessed necessary
for the prosecution.</p>

<p><q>It's fairly complete,</q> remarked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston at
the conclusion of the interview, <q>but, depending as
it does entirely upon circumstantial evidence, we shall
be obliged to proceed very slowly and cautiously.</q></p>

<p><q>My opinion entirely. Just enough evidence to-
day to justify a remand, you know.</q></p>

<p><q>Precisely. Well, Rabbits, I shall be at the court
as near as possible at two.</q></p>

<p><q>Good morning, then, for the present.</q></p>

<p><q>Good morning,</q> returned <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston.</p>

<p>And the solicitor, gathering up his papers and his
black leather bag, bustled out of the room.</p>

<p>For the next hour or so the barrister carefully
studied the facts which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rabbits had left for his
information. They fully bore out what had been told
him by Kraker, and the more he studied them the
more he became convinced that the Viscount and no
other had been the assassin of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett. Indeed,
read by the light of what he already knew—circum-
stances which at present were unknown to the solicitor
—the guilt of the young nobleman was beyond a
doubt.</p>

<p><q>Well, it's an ill wind that blows nobody any
good,</q> he murmured to himself, as he folded up his
brief. <q>It will be a <foreign xml:lang="fr">cause celebre</foreign>, and some of the
notoriety will be reflected on the lesser luminaries.
Who knows?—perhaps I shall figure in the <title>Illustrated
News</title>, <q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Edward Preston, counsel for the prosecu-
tion.</q> Ha!</q> and the young man laughed a loud
laugh.</p>

<p>Of course, the police court was densely crowded, but
it is not necessary to give a description. One scene
of this kind is very much like another, and we have
not the pen of a <q>special correspondent.</q></p>

<p>The prisoner was naturally the observed of all
observers. He was, however, not by any means dis-
turbed by his position. He was certainly pale, but
this was all. Apparently he took little interest in
the proceedings, and regarded the functionaries with
an aristocratic and nonchalant air, especially gratify-
ing to the many ladies in the court, some of whom,
to use a newspaper phrase, were <q>accommodated
with a seat on the bench.</q> As Edward Preston and
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rabbits had arranged, very little indeed was gone
into. Indeed, it scarcely amounted to more than
that which had been recounted at the inquest, and
simply related to finding the body of the murdered
woman. A remand for a week was granted, bail re-
fused, and the preliminary examination came to an
end. The only fact worth relating was that the pri-
soner was undefended, and in reply to the magistrate
as to whether he wished to ask the witnesses any
questions, answered in the negative.</p>

<p>Edward Preston slowly sauntered back to his cham-
bers in a somewhat meditative mood. Although
Marlborough Street is some distance from the Temple
he did not ride, and hence did not arrive home until
nearly five.</p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1881-12-10 -->



<!-- episode printed 1881-12-17 -->

<p><q>A gentleman been waiting to see you, sir,</q> said
his clerk. <q>Been waiting quite half-an-hour.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh. Who is he?</q></p>

<p><q>Wouldn't give his name, sir.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well.</q></p>

<p>He entered his room, and found an elderly man,
tall, and with an aristocratic air, pacing impatiently
up and down. He bowed, and the visitor, stopping
his walk, said, somewhat abruptly—</p>

<p><q>Are you <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston?</q></p>

<p><q>That is my name.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, of course; I recognise you. You looked
older in your wig and gown. Perhaps you may have
seen me at the court to-day?</q></p>

<p><q>Can't say I did,</q> replied the young barrister,
somewhat nettled at the off-hand air of the stranger.</p>

<p><q>No? Perhaps not. Well, you may know my
name. I am the Earl of Annesley.</q></p>

<p><q>Phew!</q> whistled Edward to himself, <q>the father
of <corr>Viscount</corr> Morleigh.</q></p>

<p>There did not appear to be any obvious reply to
this statement, and the young man simply bowed.</p>

<p><q>I wanted to speak to you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston, about my
—about this unfortunate affair. Now, of course, as a
lawyer, as the prosecuting lawyer, I may say, and as
a man of the world, you must already have arrived
at some opinion respecting the guilt or innocence of—
of—the accused person.</q></p>

<p><q>The deuce!</q> mutted Edward to himself, <q>this
is a singular fellow. No one would suppose from his
talk that the <q>accused person</q> was his son. I beg
your pardon, my lord,</q> said he aloud, <q>but I scarcely
gather from your remarks what you wish to convey.</q></p>

<p><q>I will be plain with you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston,</q> answered
the Earl, still walking up and down (it was singular
how his erect, well-proportioned figure and distin-
guished bearing seemed to fill the room); <q>I do not
know whether it is a fair question, or whether it would
be unprofessional on your part to answer such a ques-
tion, but what I wish to know is this—Have you
sufficient evidence in your possession to show without
much doubt that my son is guilty of the crime which
is laid at his door?</q></p>

<p><q>I will frankly confess to you, my lord, that I think
this is a question which ought not to be put to any
advocate.</q></p>

<p><q>Probably,</q> returned the Earl, unmoved. <q>I am,
however, in an exceptional position, and I have a right
to know. The honour of my lineage is in any case
tarnished, and I am the last person in the world to
shield a guilty man, even though he be my own son.</q></p>

<p><q>I repeat, my lord, that this is a question which I
would rather not answer. I should have thought that
your own feelings——</q></p>

<p><q><emph>My</emph> feelings!</q> said the Earl, in a tone of ineffable
scorn; <q>what have they to do with my honour? I
ask you again, as one who has a right to know, do you
believe Viscount Morleigh to be guilty or not?</q></p>

<p><q>If I speak the truth, my lord, I do.</q></p>

<p>If Edward Preston expected his answer to have any
effect on the Earl he must have been grievously dis-
appointed, for the muscles of that hard, handsome face
never quivered, the eye never blanched, and he showed
not by the least sign that he felt any emotion.</p>

<p><q>And you have evidence in support of that belief?</q></p>

<p><q>Ample.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank you. That is all I wish to ask. I will not
take up any more of your time,</q> and carelessly putting
on his hat he walked towards the door.</p>

<p>At first the barrister was overcome with astonish-
ment, and it was only when the nobleman had reached
the staircase that he recovered his presence of mind.</p>

<p><q>My lord,</q> he cried, <q>hear me for one moment.
Your son to-day was undefended. I gather from your
tone that you are not friends. Now, I implore you—
believe me, I speak will all sincerity—to spare no ex-
pense in procuring him the best advice possible. I
have no right to make this statement, but the case is
very strong against him, and unless he be very ably
defended I would not answer for the consequences.</q></p>

<p><q>That is enough, sir. I wish to hear no more.
What I shall do is my own affair.</q></p>

<p>And coldly lifting his hat the Earl descended the
staircase with his usual dignity, and walked to his
carriage, which was waiting for him in Fleet Street.</p>

<p><q>Well, I have had some extraordinary affairs to
deal with, but this goes beyond every one. I am
awfully glad I'm not mixed up in mysteries. To say
the least of them, they are terrible hindrances to
work.</q></p>

<p>And lighting his meerschaum, he sat down to his
books, although every now and then he could not help
pausing to puzzle over the enigma which had just been
presented to him.</p>

<p><q>Let me see,</q> he muttered, after going over the
story for about the twentieth time. <q>According to
Kraker's theory this Viscount is illegitimate. The
Earl evidently is a relic of the feudal times, a man
who I thought until now was only found in the pages
of the novelist. He gave the key to his character
when he said that his feelings were as nothing com-
pared to his honour. It is possible he is going to
throw over this man, and reinstate the rightful heir?
By Jove, it looks like it!</q></p>

<p>And this was the conclusion that Edward Preston
came to.</p>

</div>



<div n="15" type="chapter">

<head type="num">Chapter XV.</head>
<head type="main">Love Triumphant.</head>

<p>Three days passed over, and during this time both
Matthew Kraker and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rabbits were hard at work
at what is known in legal parlance, <q>getting up the
case.</q> Edward Preston had heard nothing more from
the Earl, and whether his surmise had been a correct
one or not he could not say. On the fourth day, about
ten o'clock in the morning, when he was deep in a
somewhat intricate brief, came a tap at the door.</p>

<p><q>What is it?</q> he called out.</p>

<p><q>A lady to see you.</q></p>

<p><q>What does she want?</q></p>

<p><q>Don't know, sir. Wouldn't tell me her name.
Wants to see you on more important business.</q></p>

<p>The barrister was not particularly well pleased at
this interruption, for he wanted the morning to him-
self.</p>

<p><q>Confound it!</q> he muttered; <q>that's just the way
with all women. If a favourite cat dies it is the
most important thing in the world. Well, I suppose
I must see her. Show the lady in, Fermor,</q> he called
out.</p>

<p>The door opened, and the rustling of a silk dress
was heard in the passage, but he did not trouble to
look up until the lady was fairly in the room. Then
turning his head he saw a tall and graceful figure,
elegantly dressed, and closely veiled.</p>

<p><q>Will you be seated, madam?</q> said he, pointing to
a chair by the table.</p>

<p>The lady did not notice his motion, but advancing
close to him raised her veil with her left hand, and
held out to him the right.</p>

<p>He started with astonishment, for in the features of
the lady before him he recognised Florence Dorrington.</p>

<p><q>We are friends, are we not?</q> said she, with a sad
smile.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston rose somewhat confusedly, and bent for
a moment over the hand outstretched to him to hide
his emotion.</p>

<p><q>Yes, Miss Dorrington,</q> he replied in a low voice;
<q>certainly.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you know why I have come?</q> she inquired.</p>

<p><q>I cannot even guess.</q></p>

<p>It was scarcely a week since he received the death
blow to all his hopes, and the wound was still fresh.
He flattered himself that he was beginning to over-
come his passion, but at the sight of Florence it had
returned, and before her he felt quite powerless. She
sat down, and for a few moments seemed to be col-
lecting her thoughts. Then raising her eyes to the
young man's face, she said—</p>

<p><q>I hardly know how to tell you the business upon
which I wish to speak. It is so terrible, so unexpected,
so——</q></p>

<p>Her voice trembled, and for a moment she could not
go on. The barrister, who was scarcely less agitated,
though outwardly calm, now saw that her face was
deadly pale, and her bosom heaving with emotion.</p>

<p><q>Whatever trouble you have, Miss Dorrington, in
which I can in any way be useful, you have but to
command me. I shall esteem it the greatest honour
and the greatest privilege if I am able to do you even
the humblest service.</q></p>

<p>It was only by a violent effort that he spoke these
words so composedly as he did. He was too proud to
let her see how deeply he was moved, and she never
suspected the passion which underlaid his words, com-
monplace and simple as they were.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> she went on in a firmer tone, <q>I was sure
of that. And it is in your power to do me the greatest
service possible; although,</q> she added, a faint colour
tinging her cheek as she spoke, <q>I am the last person
in the world who should ask it. But you are generous,
I know, and when you know what I have to say you
will pity me, and help me. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston, I have come
to ask your assistance on behalf of Viscount Morleigh,
who is accused of—of—but I need not tell you the
terrible charge. You, with everyone else, must know
of it by this time.</q></p>

<p><q>Great heaven!</q> exclaimed the young man, in-
voluntarily.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> continued the lady, misunderstanding the
reason of his exclamation; <q>a more baseless assertion
was never made. But you are powerful and clever.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, yes,</q> broke in Edward, somewhat impa-
tiently. <q>But why do you come to me? His father
is a peer of the realm; and those with money do not
usually lack friends.</q></p>

<p><q>His father!</q> repeated Florence. <q>But you do
not know at all. His father has refused to have any-
thing to do with him. He is alone in prison, without
absolutely a friend.</q></p>

<p>The barrister rose from his seat in agitation. A
dreadful suspicion had seized him, and he could no
longer retain his composure. Florence was at first too
troubled herself to remark his agitation. She had
indeed noticed his exclamation, but could not suspect
the cause. She thought naturally that he still had the
remembrance of her refusal of his hand in his mind,
that he loved her yet, and the scar was still fresh.
The idea, of course, distressed her, and she felt a
feeling of shame creep over her.</p>

<p><q>I could not go to anyone else,</q> she murmured.
<q>They could not understand me, nor take that inte-
rest which I felt you would do.</q></p>

<p>The exclamation seemed literally to be forced from
him, and he turned his face from the light so that
Florence should not see the struggle that was going
on within.</p>

<p><q>With you,</q> she continued, in a pleading, tearful
voice, <q>I have no fear. You have told me you are
my friend, and you will not deceive me. Oh, <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Preston, do help me. I do not know why they accuse
him, but I swear to you he is innocent.</q></p>

<p>Knowing what he did, and with every startling link
of evidence furnished him by Kraker and the solicitor
riveted firmly in his brain, how could he hear her thus
touchingly express her belief in this man's innocence
and not suffer inexpressible torture? And then her
manner, if not her words, had suddenly revealed to
him a fact of which previously he had not had the
faintest suspicion. With the quickness of love he had
discovered that this Viscount Morleigh, this sham
nobleman, this suspected murderer, was the lover of
the girl whom he himself would have made his wife.
All was now as clear as noon. This was why she had
refused him, and this was why she had come to seek
his aid. The thought was agonising.</p>

<p><q>Miss Dorrington,</q> he said, in a hard voice,
strangely unlike his usually pleasant tone, <q>I fear
you deceive yourself. The evidence is very clear in-
deed against Viscount Morleigh.</q></p>

<p><q>The evidence!</q> Florence repeated in a bewildered
tone. <q>Why, what can you know? Nothing has yet
appeared.</q></p>

<p><q>Simply,</q> he replied mechanically, <q>that I am
retained for the prosecution.</q></p>

<p>Florence guess rather than knew what this phrase
implied, and she seemed utterly crushed by this un-
expected news.</p>

<p><q>I pity you, Miss Dorrington, from the bottom of
my heart,</q> he continued; <q>but it is better you should
learn the truth from the mouth of a friend than——</q></p>

<p><q>Stay,</q> she cried, suddenly rising to her feet and
confronting him. <q>Is it the act of a friend to believe
that a man is guilty before he has been allowed to
prove his innocence? What is the charge against
Viscount Morleigh? Why should it not be a tissue of
falsehoods? Why should he wish for the death of
anyone—of a woman whom he has never seen? Lord
Morleigh is the soul of honour; those who know him
know it, but it is the people who accuse him who are
wicked and base.</q></p>

<p>Her pale cheeks flushed, her eyes sparkled, with the
fire in them, her voice trembled with indignation, and
never before had the young barrister seen her look so
beautiful. And then came the reaction, for scarcely
had she finished speaking ere she sank into a chair,
and covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>Immeasurably distressed, and, indeed, almost be-
side himself, the young man sought to comfort her.
But she never heeded him, the sobs which escaped at
intervals from her overcharged breast indicating how
deep was her emotion. What could he do? Even
supposing the Viscount was falsely accused, could he
be guilty of such weakness, and could he disregard
professional etiquette so far as to throw up the brief
he had received that morning, and go over on the
other side? And yet it was possible, loving Florence
as he still did, that he could be the chief instrument
in bringing to the scaffold the man whom she rightly
or wrongly loved? True, if he wished to be revenged
here was an unexampled opportunity, but he was a
gentleman, and not for a moment would he allow so
unworthy a feeling to triumph over him. Never be-
fore, it seemed to him, had a man been placed in so
difficult a position, and for some few minutes he was
silent, and nought was heard in the room but the
convulsive sobs of the distressed girl by his side.</p>

<!-- episode printed 1881-12-24 -->

<p><q>Miss Dorrington,</q> said he at last, <q>some day,
perhaps, you will not think me so heartless as my
words may have appeared to you. I have thought
over this matter, and I may tell you now that it is my
intention to at once return the brief with which I
have been entrusted this morning.</q></p>

<p>She looked up with swimming eyes, and rested
them searchingly on his face.</p>

<p><q>Then you will defend him?</q> she said, quickly.</p>

<p><q>That I cannot do,</q> he replied, with some gentle-
ness of manner. <q>You know not what you ask. It
is opposed to all professional honour and etiquette.
Believe me, I will do anything to assist you but that.
I am not the only barrister in the world,</q> he added,
smiling sadly. <q>There is <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Roxby; he has had far
more experience than I, and is a Q.C. besides.</q></p>

<p><q>But I cannot explain myself to him as I have to
you,</q> murmured Florence.</p>

<p><q>I will see <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Roxby myself. That shall not give
you any trouble.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston. I do not deserve such
kindness at your hands. There is one more thing I
would like to ask, but I am almost afraid.</q></p>

<p><q>And what is that?</q> inquired the young barrister,
gravely.</p>

<p><q>If you would only see—see Viscount Morleigh
yourself,</q> returned the lady, hesitatingly. <q>If you
would only question him, and hear from his own lips
his story, I think—nay, I feel almost sure—you would
believe in his innocence as much as I do.</q></p>

<p>Edward Preston did not for a moment reply. A
struggle was evidently going on within him. At last
he said—</p>

<p><q>For your sake, Miss Dorrington, I will do this.</q></p>

<p>She looked at him gratefully, and thought how she
had misjudged him. She had fancied he was cold and
mechanical, but her woman's intuition now told her
that he loved her with a depth she never could have
imagined possible.</p>

<p><q>Good-bye, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston. I shall never forget
how good you have been to me.</q></p>

<p>The young man half-sighed. It was, however, but
a momentary weakness. With his customary polite-
ness he bade his visitor adieu, and conducted her
down the somewhat dark staircase, and then, return-
ing to his room, more desolate than ever now that
Florence was gone, once more plunged into his work.</p>

</div>

<head type="main">The Web is Drawn Tighter.</head>

<p>Before transferring the case to his friend, Edward
Preston once more looked over the evidence which the
energy and sagacity of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker had collected.
From this he found it proved, with a fair amount of
certainty, that the day after Gerald had called upon
the Viscount, the latter kept within his room, and
gave orders that anyone who called to see him was to
be told he had gone into the country for the day. He
had a very slight dinner, consisting of a mutton cut-
let, of which he ate but a small portion, and a couple
of glasses of hock. He seemed to be very irritable,
and the impression in the household was that he was
unwell. On the following morning he rose late, com-
plained of a headache, and drank a cup of tea, eating
nothing but a scrap of dry toast. His valet heard
him say once to himself, <q>I must put an end to this
suspense</q>; and on another occasion, <q>It is the only
way.</q> He wrote two letters that morning, one ad-
dressed to Miss Florence Dorrington, which Jenkins,
the footman, was charged to deliver only to herself,
and the other to a man at the Reform Club—the
name Jenkins could not recollect. The valet declared
that the second letter contained two bank notes. He
kept at home that day, and went to bed early. On
the following day, which was Tuesday, the 25th of
May, he rose at a somewhat earlier hour than usual,
was strangely impatient in his manner, and altogether
unlike himself. He went into the garden, but soon
returned to the house, sat for a while in the library,
glanced over the <title>Times</title> and seemed disturbed, and the
valet declared, as if he were expecting something
that would not arrive. Of the rest of the day the
valet knew nothing, as his master gave him a holiday,
as he had already told <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker. About noon a
post arrived, and by it a letter which the Viscount
tore open and read eagerly. He was heard by the
page to mutter, <q>She will not. Then I must find
other means.</q> This letter he burnt. He dined at
six, and two of his friends calling upon him about this
hour tried to persuade him to accompany <choice><corr>them</corr><orig>him</orig></choice> to the
opera. He refused, on the ground that he had an
important engagement. He ate a little more at dinner
than he had the previous days, and drank an entire
bottle of chablis, and afterwards two small glasses of
curacoa. He then smoked a cigar in the dining room,
a most unusual thing for him to do. At half-past
seven, according to the evidence of the valet, but
nearly eight by the hall porter, he went out, carrying
in his hand an umbrella. He returned at two o'clock
in the morning; the porter, who, by the way, he had
told not to wait up, waking at this hour on hearing
him let himself in and ascend the staircase. On
Wednesday the valet, on returning from his holiday,
was struck with the state of his master's clothes.
(This, it will be remembered, did not quite coincide
with the man's first statement to the amateur detec-
tive. He then said he did not remember seeing the
clothes before, but afterwards, on being pressed, owned
that this statement was incorrect.) They were damp
and muddy, and the trousers were torn. When he
made a slight remark on the subject to his master,
the latter replied sharply, <q>What is it to do with
you? They will come to you the sooner, that is all.</q>
He seemed to be in better health and spirits, and ate
a fair breakfast. The morning he passed in his study,
and burnt several papers. On the following day his
former indisposition returned, and on Friday, on which
day he expected his father, he became worse. His
valet offered to fetch a doctor, but he refused peremp-
torily. This, in substance, was the evidence which
had been collected from the servants of the Earl's
household.</p>

<p>Edward closed the manuscript with a grave air.</p>

<p><q>Poor girl, poor girl,</q> he sighed, <q>everything that
comes out makes his guilt blacker and blacker.</q></p>

<p>In the afternoon he set out on his mission. Nothing
but the deep love he had for Florence could have in-
duced him to undertake the task he had imposed upon
himself. Let him take the most favourable view he
could, there was but one conclusion he could come to,
and his work of interrogation seemed to him the most
profitless that could be imagined. Nevertheless he
was curious to hear the Viscount's defence, and, from
a professional point, this, at all events, promised
something instructive. By a strong effort of self-
control he had resolutely buried all bitterness which
the thought that he was about to assist his fortunate
rival might have suggested, and when he appeared
before the accused man in Newgate (where, for the
present he was lodged, the magistrate absolutely
refusing all offers of bail), he was the keen lawyer,
immovable by any feeling save that of doing the best
for his client. He found the Viscount calm in man-
ner, but with a weary and worn expression on his
face, which, it may be added, was very pale.</p>

<p><q>The face of a determined man,</q> was the barrister's
thought as he bowed.</p>

<p><q>I need not say upon what errand I have come,</q>
said he; <q>Miss Dorrington has doubtless written to
you on the subject.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. It is very kind of you to interest yourself
in me,</q> answered the Viscount in a mechanical tone.</p>

<p>Edward took no notice of his remark, but resumed.</p>

<p><q>In the course of the questions I may have to put
to you it is possible there are some which will cause
you pain. You will, however, take it that I have no
other object than to make your defence as complete
as possible.</q></p>

<p>The Viscount bowed.</p>

<p><q>I am prepared to answer anything you may ask
me,</q> said he simply.</p>

<p>The barrister bowed. <q>Nothing like taking a man
by surprise,</q> he thought. <q>I will plunge into the
matter by a few leading questions.</q></p>

<p><q>My lord,</q> said he, <q>I believe I am right in sup-
posing that you are aware of the exact relationship existing
between yourself and the Earl of Annesley?</q></p>

<p>The young man's pale face flushed.</p>

<p><q>I am aware,</q> he replied, <q>that I am the natural
son of the Earl of Annesley. I am aware, further,
that my father could not recognize me if he wished, as
his lawful son is at this moment alive.</q></p>

<p><q>Precisely. Now, I may say that I know some-
thing of this matter, but I should like to hear from
your own mouth how you first became acquainted with
the fact that you were disinherited.</q></p>

<p><q>I have no objection whatever to tell you;</q> and the
Viscount related the particulars of his interview with
Gerald, and, as far as Edward could recollect, his
version agreed with what he had already heard. <q>I
will not pretend,</q> the young man said in conclusion,
<q>but that I felt as if a terrible blow had fallen upon
me. Educated as I had been, the sacrifice I should
have to make was enough to turn a man's brain. You
must remember that I had no thoughts of contesting
the rights of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Delanne, and it was only at the
persuasion of my father that I consented to maintain
my position.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, an ingenious and well-worked-out story,</q>
thought the barrister. <q>Of course you were prepared
for what this decision involved. An expensive law-
suit, a number of witnesses, and one of them, if I do
not mistake, who could throw an important light upon
the matter?</q></p>

<p>Viscount Morleigh looked up sharply as Edward
Preston pronounced the last words.</p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1881-12-24 -->




<!-- episode printed 1881-12-31 -->

<p><q>I understand your allusion. You mean <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Rennett,</q> said he. <q>Oh yes, we were prepared for
the consequences.</q></p>

<p><q>How coolly he says it,</q> murmured <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston.
<q>Well, there is one important question upon which I
should like to have a little light thrown. When you
were arrested you exclaimed, <q>I am lost!</q> What did
you mean by that?</q></p>

<p><q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston,</q> returned the Viscount with warmth,
<q>imagine yourself accused of such a crime. Would
you not be overwhelmed, knowing as I did, the fright-
ful possibilities arising from such an accusation?
Something within me said, <q>Who is most interested
in the death of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett?</q> You know as well as
I the only answer to this terrible question. No won-
der I exclaimed, <q>I am lost!</q></q></p>

<p>The explanation was reasonable; the barrister ad-
mitted it to be so.</p>

<p><q>Had you ever been to the house of this woman?</q>
he inquired after a pause.</p>

<p><q>Three or four times with my father; but, of
course, I did not know the hold she had upon our
family.</q></p>

<p><q>And if you had gone there, say, late in the even-
ing, do you think she would had admitted you?</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly.</q></p>

<p><q>You were ill, were you not, about the time of the
murder?</q></p>

<p><q>I had been indisposed, and I had reason to be.</q></p>

<p><q>Why did you forbid your valet going for a doctor?</q></p>

<p><q>What good could he do? All the science in the
world could not give me my legitimacy.</q></p>

<p><q>And those papers you burnt?</q></p>

<p><q>Of no consequence to anyone. I burnt them
because I had made up my mind to leave my father's
house; a decision which, as I have already told you,
I afterwards altered at his persuasion.</q></p>

<p>To all these questions the prisoner replied without
the least hesitation. His manner was assured, his
voice did not tremble, he did not betray the least
emotion. There was a silence of some two or three
minutes, during which Edward Preston argued with
himself the possibility of the Viscount's innocence.
But he could see no loophole of escape. His story
it was true, was well connected and feasible, but what
did this amount to? A man who was capable of
carrying out so skilfully and so boldly a murder of
such enormity was capable of providing himself with
a good defence. As Kraker had said, nothing had
been left to chance. All was carefully planned and
coolly executed.</p>

<p><q>This is all very well, as far as it goes,</q> observed the
young barrister, <q>but, of course, it does not touch the
chief point at issue. Now, tell me, if you will, how
you spent your time on the evening of Tuesday, the
25th of May?</q></p>

<p>For the first time Viscount Morleigh hesitated, and
betrayed confusion. His disconcerted look did not
escape the keen eye of the questioner.</p>

<p><q>During the evening of the 25th?</q> he repeated, as
if to gain time.</p>

<p><q>Yes. Your chance of being found innocent
greatly depends on this.</q></p>

<p><q>I must own that I have some difficulty in satisfy-
ing you on this point. I have not a very good memory
for that kind of thing.</q></p>

<p><q>But it is not so long ago,</q> said Edward. <q>If I
had asked you to remember what took place on a
certain night, say, in January, there might be some
foundation for your excuse.</q></p>

<p><q>I suppose I must have gone out somewhere, but I
really can't recollect.</q></p>

<p>Edward's manner became a little grave.</p>

<p><q>Let us see if we can't aid your memory. Where
did you dine?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, at home, of course.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you remember doing anything out of the way
—did you drink a whole bottle of chablis, for in-
stance?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, that is quite true. Barker, the butler, would
swear to that,</q> answered the prisoner, who had by
this time recovered his composure.</p>

<p><q>And did not two friends call upon you, and you
objected to go to the opera with them on the ground
that you had an important engagement?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, that was so. But my excuse was only to get
rid of them. I had no other motive.</q></p>

<p><q>During the day you were heard to say, <q>She will
not. Then I must find some other means.</q> Of whom
did you speak?</q></p>

<p><q>Of a person to whom I had written the previous
day, and who had just replied. I had the letter in
my hand when I uttered the words. Really, if I had
been the murderer, I could not have been more closely
watched.</q></p>

<p>The young man spoke with a certain amount of
sarcasm, his coolness extorting from the barrister an
inward expression of admiration. But will all his
admiration he felt puzzled. Kraker had made sure
that the Viscount would have had his proof of an
<foreign>alibi</foreign> beautifully complete, but, in point of fact, there
was not the least attempt at proving an <foreign>alibi</foreign>. If he
had no better tale than this, what possible defence
could be offered to the overwhelming evidence in the
possession of the police?</p>

<p>He went on with his questioning.</p>

<p><q>And after dinner what did you do?</q></p>

<p><q>I went out.</q></p>

<p><q>Immediately?</q></p>

<p><q>No; I smoked a cigar first.</q></p>

<p><q>By the way, what cigars do you generally smoke?</q></p>

<p><q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston, you may have some reason for ask-
ing such a question, but I really do not see its
relevancy. You cannot complain that I have kept
anything from you, looking at you, as I do, in the
light of a confessor.</q></p>

<p><q>I have nothing to complain of,</q> answered Edward,
calmly. <q>But I have a reason for asking this ap-
parently trivial question.</q></p>

<p><q>If you wish to know, then, I generally smoke
cheroots.</q></p>

<p><q>And usually in a cigar holder?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> returned the Viscount, with a surprised air.</p>

<p><q>What time was it when you went out?</q></p>

<p><q>About eight, as nearly as I can recollect.</q></p>

<p><q>Had you an umbrella?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes.</q></p>

<p><q>And where did you go?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I simply went out for a stroll.</q></p>

<p><q>What! Strolled about all the evening?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes.</q></p>

<p><q>Then, perhaps, you will be good enough to tell me
where you strolled as near as you can?</q></p>

<p><q>That is easier said than done,</q> rejoined the Vis-
count, with a little of his former embarrassment. <q>I
took no heed where I went, for I simply went out to
get rid of the blues which had been tormenting me for
some days past. You can understand my condition of
mind. I know I went in the direction of Hyde Park,
and I think I remember being at one time in the
Brompton Road, but really I quite forget.</q></p>

<p>Edward grew more and more dissatisfied.</p>

<p><q>But surely,</q> he urged, <q>you met someone, or
called somewhere, so that we could get a little corro-
borative evidence. If you even purchased a box of
cigar lights for one of your cheroots it would be some-
thing.</q></p>

<p><q>I did nothing of the kind. I went nowhere. I
saw no one.</q></p>

<p><q>Then, Viscount Morleigh, all I can say is that you
are a most unfortunate man. It so happens that on
this particular Tuesday evening, somewhere between
eight o'clock and midnight, this woman was murdered.
For heaven's sake, try and recollect something of
your doings on that night. Do you know that the
evidence against you is of the strongest possible kind?</q></p>

<p>The barrister's words evidently unnerved the pri-
soner. The blood fled from his lips, his face became
of an unnatural, death-like pallor, and his eyes glared
wildly. Passing his hand over his forehead with a
gesture of despair, he replied—</p>

<p><q>I am, indeed, unfortunate, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston, but I can
say nothing further.</q></p>

<p>Edward rose from his seat. He could do no
more, say no more. Whether the prisoner was speak-
ing the truth, or whether he was simply acting, he
could not determine, but of this he was certain that
in the eyes of a jury the inability to prove an <foreign>alibi</foreign>
would be of the gravest moment. The young man
paced up and down for a few seconds, and then stop-
ping suddenly, said—</p>

<p><q>The woman was stabbed by a broken foil. By a
singular coincidence a broken foil was also found in
your room.</q></p>

<p><q>That is very likely. I broke one a month since,
fencing with Castelli, the Life Guards instructor.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well; but what has become of the other
portion? The hilt only was found.</q></p>

<p><q>That I cannot tell. Probably Wicks, my valet,
may know.</q></p>

<p><q>But this is not all. A mould of footprints found
in the garden of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett has been taken, and
corresponds exactly with your shoes.</q></p>

<p><q>I cannot help it. I suppose it is nothing extra-
ordinary for two people to have the same sized feet.
Any shoemaker would get over that difficulty.</q></p>

<p><q>Possibly; but, in addition, let me say that the
impression made by an umbrella handle where it fell
in the mud also corresponds precisely with an umbrella
in your possession.</q></p>

<p><q>Umbrellas are made of one pattern by the score,</q>
answered the Viscount calmly.</p>

<p><q>You smoke cheroots in a cigar holder. The end
of a cheroot has been found in the murdered woman's
room, unmoistened by contact with the lips.</q></p>

<p><q>It is a singular fatality. An extraordinary chain
of coincidences—nothing more.</q></p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1881-12-31 -->



<!-- episode printed 1882-01-07 -->

<p><q>I have not finished. The murderer of <corr><abbr>Mrs.</abbr></corr> Rennett
wore gloves—grey kid gloves. The miserable woman,
in her death struggles, seized the hands of the mur-
derer, and portions of the leather were found under-
neath her nails. The gloves found with your clothes
in the wardrobe were not only of grey kid, but had
minute stripes torn from the surface.</q></p>

<p>The fact could not be disguised. The Viscount was
absolutely terrified at this extraordinary accumulation
of damning facts. The perspiration stood upon his
brow in large drops, and his hands absolutely trembled.
In a hoarse whisper he muttered, <q>It is horrible,
horrible.</q></p>

<p><q>And then the clothes, the coat damp and soiled,
the trousers muddy and torn! You see, my lord, that
all this will have to be satisfactorily explained. No
counsel will be able to help you unless you are per-
fectly candid.</q></p>

<p><q>I can only recognise this, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston,</q> answered
the Viscount, endeavouring to speak in a firm voice;
<q>that I am the victim of one of those extraordinary
sequence of coincidences which makes me almost
doubt one's being. I can only say I am innocent.</q></p>

<p><q>You have only to explain where you passed the
evening of Monday, the 25th, and your innocence is
proved.</q></p>

<p><q>I have already told you I cannot. I have no more
to add.</q></p>

<p><q>Then, may heaven have mercy on you. Probably
you will be waited on by a solicitor—for what I have
done to-day is quite unprofessional, and undertaken
solely for the sake of one who takes a deep interest in
you—and by that time you will have remembered
more than you have told me.</q></p>

<p><q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston,</q> exclaimed the prisoner, evidently
moved, <q>you mean well towards me I am sure, and
with the terrible charge hanging over my head, and
with these frightful proofs to combat, you may well
suppose that I appreciate the friendly act of to-day.
But, in spite of appearances, I say again that I am
innocent. I own I cannot well see how to convince
you, but I do not despair. I await my trial with that
confidence which a good conscience alone can give.</q></p>

<p>The barrister was staggered for a moment, for the
prisoner spoke with such earnestness that it was diffi-
cult to believe he was not telling the truth. But then
he thought of all the surrounding circumstances, the
stakes which were at issue depending upon the utter-
ance of the murdered woman, and he quickly decided
that the acting of the Viscount was very good, nay,
superb, but still only acting. He said no more, but,
coldly bidding the prisoner adieu, he went out sadly,
thinking of the unhappiness which was in store for
poor Florence.</p>

</div>


<div n="17" type="chapter">

<head type="num">Chapter XVII.</head>
<head type="main">The Earl's Decision.</head>

<p>The extraordinary events of the last few days com-
pletely demoralised the household of the Earl of
Annesley. The fact that Viscount Morleigh had been
arrested for murder could not be long concealed, and
long before he had been brought up at the police court,
and the news spread far and wide by the newspapers,
it was known in almost every servants' hall in Bel-
gravia. As to the versions, more or less exaggerated,
they were numberless, and several knowing individuals
had already declared, with a solemn shake of the
head, that they always expected something of the
kind; that the Earl was a sad rake in his day, and his
son took after him; and everybody was good until he
was found out; and many more remarks of equal
wisdom and profundity. At <abbr>No.</abbr> 19, Chester Square,
the opinions were equally divided. The female por-
tion of the domestics were, to a woman, in favour of
the Viscount's innocence, while the men, especially
those who had been examined by the police—and,
therefore, spoke with authority—were inclined to
believe there was <q>something in it.</q></p>

<p><q>The old man, he don't seem much put out, does
he?</q> said the porter.</p>

<p><q>Ah, the Annesleys were always a proud lot,</q> re-
marked the cook.</p>

<p><q>Aye, but if the Earl don't show it, I know as he
thinks a good deal about his son. He didn't say a
word about that Julian soup as came up cold. A
week ago he'd ha' swore my 'ed off; and he ain't
touched a drop of Burgundy—the yellow seal, as he's
so fond of—since,</q> observed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barker, the butler,
not without some emotion.</p>

<p><q>It's natural enough, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barker, as he should take
on a bit,</q> said the housekeeper. <q>Although he's a
nobleman, he's got his feelings the same as us, ain't
he?</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, but don't you imagine as he goes about tell-
ing everyone, same as anybody else would. He nurses
his troubles up; and them as does that they're always
the worstest.</q></p>

<p>At that moment a violent ring of the Earl's bell
startled them all.</p>

<p><q>That's him all over,</q> said the footman; <q>he's in
a tantrum when he rings like that.</q> And, with a
somewhat bad grace, the powdered flunkey went out
of the kitchen, and ascended the broad staircase to
the Earl's apartment.</p>

<p>The proud nobleman was seated at his writing table,
and scarcely looked up as the servant entered. He
had addressed and sealed a letter, which he still held
in his hand, as if revolving something in his mind.
A movement from the servant broke his reverie.</p>

<p><q>You rang for me, my lord?</q> said interrogatively
the footman.</p>

<p><q>Yes. Take this to Russell Square, and if the
gentleman be at home wait for an answer.</q></p>

<p>And tossing the letter across the table to the man
the Earl then rose from his chair, and walked with his
usual erect air to the fireplace.</p>

<p>The footman bowed, and left the room. Directly
he got outside the door he looked at the address,
which was as follows:—</p>

<p><q>GERALD DELANNE, ESQ.,
54, Russell Square.</q></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Earl of Annesley remained standing
on the hearthrug for fully five minutes without moving
his position. His hand was placed within his vest;
his eyes were bent on the floor; the lines in his face
were harder and more tightly drawn than ever, and
emphatically he looked like a man who would rather
endure the agonies of the rack than give way an inch
in anything he had set his mind upon. After his
interview with Edward Preston he had shut himself
in his room, and was denied to all visitors. In his
way he loved his son, but the disgrace which had
fallen upon the latter touched his pride far more than
his love. His first burst of rage was terrible, but it
had no witnesses, and when the paroxysm was over
the same cool and haughty expression resumed its place
on his countenance, and only a keen observer would
have noticed anything unusual about him. With
steady nerves he had sat down and written a letter to
the Viscount, telling him that he could expect no
assistance from him, and this done he set about
revolving in his mind how to restore his tarnished
honour.</p>

<p>It was a bitter draught to swallow, but, with his
customary resolution, having decided upon a certain
course, he never thought of swerving from it, and he
resolved to brave the scandal and talk of society by
acknowledging Gerald as his lawful son, and putting
him in the Viscount's position. He felt less com-
punction in doing this from the intention expressed
by Viscount Morleigh to give way to his brother, and
hence he wrote the letter which this morning he sent
to Russell Square. It was a brief and perfectly
formal epistle, to the effect that the Earl of Annesley
had become acquainted with the discovery which <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Gerald Delanne had made of his relationship to him-
self, and of his right to the title of Viscount Morleigh,
and that he wished to see him immediately on the
subject. He waited impatiently for the return of the
messenger, and after an interval of about an hour a
gentle tap was heard at the door. A page entered
bearing in his hand a salver, on which was a visiting
card. The Earl took the card and read, mechanically,
<q>Gerald Delanne.</q></p>

<p><q>So soon,</q> he muttered. <q>Tell <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Delanne I
will see him.</q></p>

<p>The page returned, and in a few minutes the door
again opened, and Gerald entered the room. Such a
meeting under such circumstances could not fail to be
embarrassing to both men. Each, however, was accus-
tomed to school his emotions, and whatever they may
have felt inwardly, their outward behaviour was in no
way remarkable. For a brief pause they stood face to
face, buried apparently in their own reflections, in
reality engaged in a mutual examination, each trying
to gauge the thoughts of the other. And then the
Earl suddenly extended his hand, the young man
took it within his own, and without a word the intro-
duction was complete.</p>

<p><q>You have lost no time,</q> were the first words of
the nobleman.</p>

<p><q>I have always used myself to be punctual, my
lord, and on such an errand as this I was not likely to
delay.</q></p>

<p>They both spoke with a certain constraint, Gerald
meanwhile remaining standing.</p>

<p><q>Why do you not sit down?</q> demanded the Earl,
brusquely; <q>are you not my son?</q></p>

<p>Gerald obeyed silently. He was perfectly self-
possessed, and, though respectful in his manner, was
by no means obsequious.</p>

<p><q>Good!</q> muttered the nobleman. <q>He will
not disgrace me. He is neither a fool nor a
cad.</q></p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1882-01-07 -->



<!-- episode printed 1882-01-14 -->

<p><q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Delanne</q>—he spoke with an effort, for the
name conjured back a host of memories—<q>hence-
forth this house is your home. From this instant
you are Viscount Morleigh, and I reinstate you in
the possession of those rights which belong to you
by birth. Stay—not a word, do not <corr>thank</corr> me. I
want no thanks. I have restored to you what is
your just due.</q></p>

<p><q>I understand you perfectly, my lord,</q> replied
Gerald. <q>I do not know that I should ever have
been led to commit an act such as that which has
deprived me of my rights, but if I had, I declare to
you that I should have acted exactly as you have
done. Your name and position are too much under
the public gaze to allow you to do as you like.
Better a thousand times to commit an injustice than
expose one's self to vulgar comment.</q></p>

<p>This reply surprised and pleased the Earl. It
agreed precisely with his own views. But he be-
trayed no sign of satisfaction. In a cold tone, he
answered—</p>

<p><q>I have, Viscount Morleigh, no right to your
affection. I do not pretend to have. All that I ask
of you is that you should pay me that deference
which is due to a father. Filial obedience has always
been a tradition of our house, and it is partly owing
to a breach of this duty by the miserable young man
who has stained my honour that I have sent for you.
You will have exactly the same allowance he had,
the same horses, his rooms all yours. You will do
exactly as you please save in the direction I have
named; that is to say, my wishes must be yours also.
Do you ride?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, fairly well.</q></p>

<p><q>So much the better. You are no simpleton I
can see, and what I desire is that you should at
once assume your position, and take upon yourself
your new duties as if you had been used to them all
your life. This affair will be a nine days' wonder,
but people get used to everything in these times, and
they will get used to this. It all depends on you.</q></p>

<p>The young man listened to the Earl's words in a
dream. In imagination he already had Aladdin's
lamp in his hand. Whatever he wished for would
appear at his bidding. Riches, pleasures of all
kinds, were ready awaiting him. But outwardly he
was unmoved. By long practice he had so tutored
his face that it concealed all his emotions. Bowing
with cold politeness, he said—</p>

<p><q>Permit me to say, my lord, I am touched, more
than I can well express, with your generosity. But
will you allow me to suggest that in my new situa-
tion it will be necessary to proceed with caution. It
is well to despise public opinion, but not wise to
defy it. If I immediately install myself here, in
your house, what will not be said? Does it not look
like triumphing over a defeated enemy? I have
seen my—my brother, and I can assure you that
comparisons are sure to be instituted, and perhaps
they will not always be in my favour.</q></p>

<p>Gerald spoke this in a modest and deferential air,
which was not at all displeasing to the nobleman.
On his side the young man saw that the Earl was
blinded by pride and vanity, and that rightly dealt
with could easily be managed. He went on with a
little more confidence—</p>

<p><q>For these reasons I hope, my lord, that for a
short time you will not insist upon my changing my
manner of living. Would it not be better at first to
familiarise people with the change? Already they
have enough to gossip over. If I am not seen for a
little time I shall have all the benefits of being talked
about as the <q>unknown.</q> Your friends will gradu-
ally come to look for me with some curiosity, and for
myself, I shall be able to bear better this sudden
change of fortune.</q></p>

<p>The Earl thought for a moment.</p>

<p><q>Perhaps,</q> said he, after a pause, <q>you are
right, after all.</q></p>

<p>He was quite oblivious of the fact that the very
first words of Gerald were in opposition to his
wishes, and those wishes he had so strongly insisted
were to be implicitly obeyed. And, to say the truth,
Gerald himself was infinitely astonished that the
proud man so easily suffered himself to be persuaded.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> resumed the nobleman, <q>it shall be as you
suggest. But, at all events, there is nothing to pre-
vent you living here and dining with me every day.</q></p>

<p>Again Gerald had the hardihood to differ from
him.</p>

<p><q>My lord,</q> said he, <q>I owe you all obedience, I
admit, but I cannot forget I have another duty. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Delanne is at the present moment in the agonies of
death. Whatever may have been her faults, she, at
least, has loved and tended me as a mother. Can I,
ought I to leave her just now?</q></p>

<p>The Earl rose from his seat, walked up and down
the room, his hands clasped behind him. Who can
tell what his thoughts were at that moment? How,
probably, he went back in imagination some thirty
years when, in the ardour and hot blood of early
manhood, he loved Louisa Delanne, and would have
made any sacrifice for her sake.</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and said—</p>

<p><q>She is very ill, you say?</q></p>

<p><q>It is impossible for her to live many hours,</q> re-
plied Gerald.</p>

<p><q>You are right not to leave her at such a moment.
I am almost inclined—yes, I should like to see her for
a short time while she is yet alive.</q></p>

<p>The young man did not take this proposition kindly,
but he did not outwardly express any annoyance.</p>

<p><q>My lord,</q> he observed quietly, <q>to see <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Delanne would give you intense pain, and would,
besides, be quite useless. She might, indeed, be
alive, but her reason is gone. Her brain has received
so violent a shock that it gave way beneath the
strain.</q></p>

<p>The Earl replied after a pause—</p>

<p><q>Yes, it is better you should go alone. But you
must dine with me to-day. I dine at seven sharp.</q></p>

<p>And this was all that he thought of the woman who
had sacrificed herself for him! He could not endure
distressing sights, and the words of Gerald at once
put to flight the feeling of tenderness which for a
moment touched his heart.</p>

<p>The young man bowed assent, and divining that
the interview was at an end, rose, and pressing the
nobleman's hand with an air of infinite respect, with-
drew.</p>

<p><q>And so,</q> muttered the Earl, when he was left
alone, <q>that is my legitimate son. The likeness is
very striking indeed,</q> and he glanced up at a por-
trait of himself at thirty years of age hanging on the
wall. <q>Yes, there is not much doubt about his being
my offspring. After all, blood will show itself. This
young fellow will not disgrace me I can see very well.
So much the better. I am sorry for that poor devil
Frank. Not but what it was a bold stroke, but
coarse, horribly coarse. He might have found some
other way of silencing the woman. I always liked
Frank, but his Radical notions—pah! I hope my
legitimate son has not anything in common with him
in that direction.</q> And the heartless old nobleman
brushed a few grains of snuff from the frill of his
shirt, and rang the bell for his horse with more life
and energy than he had displayed for some days past.</p>

<head type="num">Chapter XVIII.</head>
<head type="main">In Which Gerald Delanne Makes a Bargain.</head>

<p>On leaving Chester Square Gerald took a hansom and
returned home.</p>

<p><q>Has anyone been for me?</q> he asked of the servant.</p>

<p><q>No, sir.</q></p>

<p>He asked the question with a certain amount of
anxiety, and seemed to be satisfied with the reply.</p>

<p><q>And the doctor?</q> he continued.</p>

<p><q>The doctor was here this morning, soon after you
went out, sir. He did not think the mistress so well,
and he said he would come again late in the day. He
is upstairs now.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah!</q></p>

<p>He took off his hat and ran his fingers through his
hair with some disquietude.</p>

<p><q>Make me a cup of coffee, Elizabeth,</q> said he;
<q>and if anyone calls show them into my room.</q></p>

<p>He slowly mounted the stairs to the first floor,
where was the bedroom of the sick woman, and softly
opened the door. The room was darkened, and the
air of stillness peculiar to a sick chamber was at once
apparent. On the bed lay <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne, her face
deadly pale, her features distorted, and her eyes
glassy and staring. She was lying perfectly motion-
less, and might have been a corpse for anything one
could tell to the contrary. On the table stood medi-
cine bottles, a glass, a plate on which was a portion
of jelly, and a mug of beef tea. A trained nurse, in
her black stuff gown, white collar and cuffs, and neat
apron, sat by the side of the table; while leaning on
the footboard of the bedstead was <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Cathcart,
calm, watchful, and professional. He turned at the
entrance of Gerald, and greeted him silently. The
latter took his hand, and gazed in his face with an
inquiring look.</p>

<p><q>Well,</q> said he, in a low voice, <q>how is she?</q></p>

<p><q>Not so well,</q> returned the doctor emphatically.
<q>Since this morning there has been a decided change
for the worse.</q></p>

<p><q>Is there no hope, then?</q> returned the young man.</p>

<p><q>Very little, I fear.</q></p>

<p>At that moment the sick woman moved, and some-
thing like a sigh escaped her pallid lips.</p>

<p><q>Did she hear what you said, do you think?</q>
asked Gerald.</p>

<p><q>It is not possible. She neither hears nor sees.</q></p>

<p>He shifted his position from the foot of the bed,
and went round to the side. Taking up the wrist of
the patient, he counted the pulsations carefully.
Then he bent over her, and looked steadfastly at her
eyes.</p>

<p><q>Look here,</q> said he, softly.</p>

<p>Gerald approached, and obeyed him. The eyes
which met his were vacant and staring. There was
not a gleam of intelligence in them.</p>

<p><q>Mother,</q> said he, in a quiet tone, <q>do you know
me? It is I—Gerald.</q></p>

<p>The immovable features betrayed not the least sign
of recognition. The fingers twitched mechanically
at the quilt. This was the only sign of life.</p>

<p><q>You see,</q> observed <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Cathcart, <q>all sense has
disappeared.</q></p>

<p><q>Poor creature!</q> muttered the young man. <q>Is
she in pain, do you think?</q></p>

<p><q>Not in the least, I should imagine—at all events,
not just now.</q></p>

<p><q>It is terrible to think of her passing away in this
condition. Is there no chance of her recovering her
reason? You know a little of our history, Cathcart?
You will understand me, I dare say, when I tell you
that for her to die without my assuring her of my
forgiveness for the injury she has inflicted upon me
would be to me a constant source of regret.</q></p>

<p><q>I understand you perfectly, my dear fellow. I only
wish that I could give you that hope. According to
medical knowledge and experience, which, after all,
when the wide field of nature is remembered, are
very limited, she cannot live; but it is impossible to
say for certain, especially in a complicated case like
this. Of course, if the brain can once exercise its
functions she may be able to rally.</q></p>

<p><q>And then would she speak?—would she recognise
me?</q></p>

<p><q>In all probability she would. But do not expect
much from this. It might be but the last flicker of
the candle. Death is a key which unlocks the earthly
casket which confines the spirit.</q></p>

<p><q>But she would have her reason even in such a
moment as this?</q></p>

<p><q>Undoubtedly. But why do you ask?</q></p>

<p><q>Because a word from <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne is of vital
importance to me.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I remember,</q> returned the young doctor,
gravely. <q>I wish, for your sake, I could give you
that promise.</q></p>

<p>He turned once more to the inanimate woman, and,
after looking at her in silence, said that he could
then do no more. He had several patients to visit,
and would look in at a later hour.</p>

<p><q>In the meantime, Gerald, were I in your place, I
would not leave her for long. Consciousness might
arrive, when it is least expected, and disappear again
as rapidly.</q></p>

<p>Gerald accompanied him downstairs to the door,
and bade him adieu, and then ascended to his own
room. He had scarcely sat down five minutes before
the servant tapped at the door, and said a gentleman
wished to see him.</p>

<p>Gerald frowned, and threw down the pen impatiently.</p>

<p><q>Did he tell you his name?</q> he called out.</p>

<p><q>Yes, sir. He said his name was Lavey.</q></p>

<p><q>The deuce take it!</q> muttered the young man.
<q>I was in hopes the old rascal would let me alone to-
day. Well, let him come up.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lavey, or Levy, as some of his friends, much to
his annoyance, would persist in calling him, was a
gentleman of an uncertain age. At a distance, looking
at his well-shaped figure and dark hair, he might be
taken for thirty. Close to, when the crows-feet at
the corner of his eyes were visible, when the jet black
colour of his hair, with its hard, unnatural outline,
betrayed the art of the perriquire, and the glittering
whiteness of his teeth showed them to be false, you
would not have been far from the mark had you put
him down at sixty. He affected a juvenility of
manner and a heartiness which not unfrequently took
in the unwary. He had an inexhaustible fund of anec-
dote, had a large acquaintance among celebrities,
both male and female, and was desirous of being taken
for one of those individuals known as <q>jolly fellows.</q>
In spite, however, of his jokes, his <foreign xml:lang="fr">bonhommie</foreign>, and
his flow of spirits, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lavey could, if he liked, be
extremely unpleasant, as many had found to their
cost. He was believed to be rich, but he never ap-
peared to be of any particular business, and was
always ready to accommodate a friend with a loan,
small or large, on the most reasonable terms. In-
deed, so good-natured was he that, when you bor-
rowed, it almost seemed as if he were giving you the
money. He was never in a hurry, would always
renew a bill; in fact, seemed to prefer that method
of doing business, and never, excepting when he was
<q>much pressed</q> himself, as he put it, would he
trouble you for payment. And yet there were ill-
natured people who asserted Lavey always screwed
his seventy per cent! Of course, this was only
calumny, as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lavey himself could indisputably
prove. He came up the stairs with an air of brisk-
ness and glee, passed the girl, much to her indignation,
and tapped at Gerald's door, and, hardly waiting
for the young man to say <q>Come in,</q> entered the
room.</p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1882-01-14 -->

<!-- episode printed 1882-01-21 -->

<p><q>Ha, ha, my learned bookworm! still poring over
musty tomes. I wonder you don't turn into one
yourself. Perhaps you will some day, only it will be
a <emph>tomb</emph>, you know. Ha, ha! Forget, though;
oughtn't to make a jest of such subjects, 'specially
just now. Really, I'm awfully sorry to hear your
mother's so ill.</q></p>

<p>Gerald could scarcely disguise his disgust, but he
said nothing, and simply rose and politely handed his
visitor a chair.</p>

<p><q>And how are you, dear boy, hay? Too much of
the midnight oil, I fancy. A little whiter about the
gills that you ought to be, hay?</q></p>

<p>Gerald answered that he was pretty well, and, in
return, inquired after his visitor's health with much
apparent interest.</p>

<p><q>Can't complain. Eat well, sleep well, drink well,
and what more can a man want, hay?</q> And <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Lavey leaned back in his chair, expanded his mouth
into a grin, and caressed his dyed whiskers. <q>And
how is mademoiselle?</q> he added, with a disagreeable
air.</p>

<p><q>Quite well; I thank you,</q> returned the young
man, coldly. <q>But I suppose you did not come to
talk about her?</q></p>

<p><q>Faith no,</q> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lavey, with a boisterous
laugh. <q>Although, mind you, the subject's pleasant
enough, you young Alki—— What the doose is the
Greek fellow's name—though it ain't the least con-
sequence—that that bill of yours is due to-day.
Devillish unlucky that I've got to meet an accept-
ance myself, or wouldn't bother you.</q></p>

<p>Gerald looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p><q>Did you not get my letter telling you I should
not be able to meet the bill, and asking you to renew
it? I wrote to you quite a fortnight ago.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lavey took a cigar from his case, lighted it,
and deliberately puffed three or four times.</p>

<p><q>Yes, I received your letter,</q> said he at last.</p>

<p><q>Well, and what then?</q></p>

<p><q>As you did not receive any reply from me I con-
cluded you would perfectly understand that I did not
intend to accede to your wish. That's my way of
doing business, dear boy—saves heaps of trouble.</q></p>

<p>There was a disagreeable gleam in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lavey's
eye, which those who knew him best said he always
had when he was inclined to be unpleasant.</p>

<p>Gerald bit his lips.</p>

<p><q>I am sorry you did not write, because I inter-
preted your silence the other way.</q></p>

<p><q>Silence gives consent, hay? No, no. There's no
rule with an exception, and I was obliged to make an
exception in your case. The bills have been renewed
four times already. Hang it! must draw the line
somewhere.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well; but you forget that if the bill had
been renewed the interest has been proportionately
high, and this I've always met.</q></p>

<p><q>My dear boy, don't think that I complain. No
one could have acted more fairly and liberally
that you have done. I've said over and over again
that it was a shame to take your money.</q></p>

<p><q>And yet I do not remember you ever having re-
fused it,</q> observed Gerald, sarcastically.</p>

<p><q>No, by Jove, that I haven't! Ha, ha! Can't do
without money, you know. Must have some enjoy-
ment in this life,</q> and he puffed vigorously at his
cigar, adding in a tone of apparent carelessness, <q>It's
worth something to keep the bills out of circulation.
No one knows of this little affair but myself. Why
should they? It's between friends, and while we're
friends we'll <q>act as sich.</q> Ha, ha!</q></p>

<p>He knocked off the ash of his cigar, and looked
Gerald full in the face. He evidently knew the
vulnerable points in the armour of his companion.
The latter did not reply, but with his elbow resting
on his desk and his head on his hand, was apparently
absorbed in his thoughts.</p>

<p><q>Don't you think, now,</q> observed the money
lender, crossing his legs and settling himself com-
fortably, <q>that if these bills of yours had passed out
of my hands you would have found some way of meet-
ing them? Publicity is a great spur. But I know
what you young fellows say—<q>Oh, Lavey's a good-
natured fool; he don't mind waiting;</q> and this is
how I'm served. By Jove, sir! you don't know the
amount of cash I've lost through being such a con-
founded fool. 'Pon my word, if everybody paid me
honourably I shouldn't want to be dunning you.</q></p>

<p><q>It's no use mincing matters,</q> said the young man,
after a pause. <q>The fact is, I have not the money
to pay you just now, nor do I know where to turn
for it.</q></p>

<p><q>The devil! so much the worse. I can't afford
to lose it. I suppose you do not want me to issue
a writ?</q></p>
</div>

<div n="20" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XX.</head>
<head type="main">The Hand of Death.</head>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker was much more disturbed by Edward
Preston's intelligence than he cared to own. It was
not so much the positive denial of the Viscount, but
his utter inability to find a defence which puzzled
him. On no principle could he reconcile it with the
caution and astuteness displayed by the murderer all
along. <q>Coincidences are curious things, and no one
can say how far circumstances may run parallel,</q> he
thought; <q>and if the Viscount put this possibility
forward as the groundwork of defence, why, his loss
of memory as to what he did on this particular
night might be deemed, if not logical, at all events
natural. But this is a <corr>subtlety</corr> which would be
utterly lost on a jury, and no man with any know-
ledge of human nature would dream of concocting so
elaborate a scheme. Is it possible I can have made
a mistake? But no, the cain is too complete.</q></p>

<p>Thus reflecting, he arrived at Russell Square. The
door was opened to him by Gerald, for the servant
had not returned from the Earl's.</p>

<p><q>Well, my dear fellow, and how is <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne?</q></p>

<p><q>As bad as she can possibly be. Her strength is
going fast. She can take no nourishment, and I
doubt very much if she will last through the night,</q>
replied the young man gravely. <q>You will come in?</q>
he added, for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker lingered hesitatingly on the 
step.</p>

<p><q>Shall I be in the way?</q> he asked.</p>

<p><q>Not at all. Nothing can be done for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> De-
lanne. It is a question of time, and I shall be only
too glad for someone to sit with me through the
weary hours. I shall not go to bed to-night.</q></p>

<p><q>If that's the case, then I'll come in.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker followed Gerald upstairs, and they
went into the latter's private room.</p>

<p><q>Sit down, Kraker, in that easy chair. You can
smoke here, you know, as much as you like. What
will you have? Here's some very fair Lafitte. I
know you don't care for anything very strong.</q></p>

<p><q>That will do very well,</q> replied Matthew, as he
sat himself down.</p>

<p>The room was lighted by a single lamp standing on
Gerald's desk, the light surmounted by a large shade
perforated in such a manner as to allow a certain
portion of light to pass through. Ever eager to pursue
his favourite study, human nature, the little man
amused himself by watching his host as he moved softly
across the room, the dark shadows in which gave it
almost a weird appearance. Whether it was due to
the coloured light, for the perforated portions of the
shade above mentioned were covered with tinted
paper, or not he could not tell, but Matthew Kraker
was struck by the peculiar aspect of Gerald's face.
He was worn and anxious, his eyes were heavy, and
there was a weariness in his movements very different
from his usually elastic tread.</p>

<p><q>In spite of the injustice she has inflicted he must
really love this woman,</q> thought <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker. <q>If
it were not that I am afraid of betraying myself I
should like just to put a few questions on the sub-
ject. I wonder whether she has made any utterance
about the murder? Well, well, patience has served
me before, and perhaps it will serve me again.</q></p>

<p>Meanwhile Gerald had placed a bottle and glasses
before his visitor, and had seated himself in the
chair near the desk. He did not seem inclined to
talk, and Kraker was not the man to hurry him.
For a few minutes there was a silence, broken only
by the occasional puffs which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker gave at
his pipe.</p>

<p>At last the young man, looking up, said—</p>

<p><q>You're not in a hurry for that money, are you,
Kraker?</q></p>

<p><q>Not at all. Don't bother about it just now.
You have plenty to think about, and I'm not in
want of it.</q></p>

<p><q>If you are really pressed I dare say I could
manage it for you. If not, I should be glad to let
it stand over for a month or two.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't say another word, my boy.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, it's only right you should know how I
stand. In three months' time all my difficulties
will be over. I have seen the Earl of Annesley.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker could have jumped off the chair. The
conversation was taking just the line he wanted.
However, he never moved a muscle of his counten-
ance, and simply replied—</p>

<p><q>Ah, and with what result?</q></p>

<p><q>He has acknowledged my claim.</q></p>

<p><q>The deuce he has!</q> exclaimed Matthew, fairly
startled out of his composure.</p>

<p><q>Yes; and with no pressure on my part. In
fact, he sent for me for the purpose. It is but a
question of a few weeks and I assume my lawful
position.</q></p>

<p><q>How extraordinary! And with no more evi-
dence of your legitimacy that what you have told
me?</q></p>

<p><q>Why, what more would you have?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, it is not complete, as you yourself pointed
out. If the Viscount can clear himself of this charge
he will have some ground to contest your claim.
The substitution has only been suggested, not
proved.</q></p>

<p><q>Precisely, and it is this which troubles me.
Should <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne die without making reparation,
and assuring me that she carried out the wishes of
the Earl, my brother will be able to make a good
fight, if he is declared innocent of this crime.</q></p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne, then, has been silent on the
subject?</q></p>

<p><q>She has admitted that I am not her son, but of
what value is this admission without witnesses? A
word from her now, say, in your presence, and be-
fore a medical man—this is important, because it
might be said she was not in her right mind—would
be of incalculable value. But since her attack she
has been unconscious. The brain is paralysed.</q></p>

<p><q>Then what are the Earl's intentions towards the
Viscount?</q> inquired Kraker, after a pause.</p>

<p><q>I don't know, but I suspect very strongly that
he means to leave him to his fate.</q></p>

<p><q>Confound it, that's rather heartless!</q> exclaimed
Kraker.</p>

<p><q>Possibly; but I'm not at all sure the Earl is
not right,</q> replied Gerald, coldly.</p>

<p><q>From one point of view, yes. A man who could
commit so cold-blooded a crime does not deserve
much sympathy; but for all that it is rather like
prejudging the case. Now, a few days ago, I was
as positive as a man could be that the Vis-
count——</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker paused. He saw Gerald look up
curiously at him, and he suddenly remembered that
he was approaching dangerous ground. Very little
of the real facts of the case had yet appeared in the
newspapers. Only the first examination at the police
court had yet been held, and, as we have seen,
nothing of the circumstantial evidence collected by
Kraker had been brought forward. Hence, to say
positively that the Viscount was innocent or guilty
was to assume much more than the published details
could warrant. True, Kraker had been made ac-
quainted with a motive for the crime by Gerald's
story, but in all their conversation they had never
alluded to the murder excepting as a circumstance
most unfortunate for young Delanne.</p>

<p><q>Yes, you were saying,</q> put in Gerald.</p>

<p><q>Simply, from what you have told me suspicion
points more strongly to the Viscount.</q></p>

<p><q>Unhappily it does. However, that is a question
the law must decide as far as I am concerned. The
Earl chooses to reinstate me; it is a decision justi-
fied by equity, if not by law, and I do not see why
any sentimental consideration should prevent me
from coinciding with it.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course not,</q> replied Kraker.</p>

<p>There was a pause, at the end of which Gerald
rose, and, asking Kraker to excuse him, said he was
about to see how <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne was.</p>

<p><q>I must not leave her long. You can easily un-
derstand why,</q> said he.</p>

<p>He was absent for five or six minutes. While
Kraker was alone he heard the street door open, and
someone ascend the staircase.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Gerald returned.</p>

<p><q>The doctor has just come,</q> said he. <q>There is
a decided change, whether for better or worse he
cannot yet tell. Have you any objection to seeing
her, Kraker? I have explained why to Cathcart,
and he has raised no opposition. Indeed, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> De-
lanne is in such a state that nothing can possibly
affect her.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker was only too glad to have the oppor-
tunity; but, of course, he did not say so. He
simply replied that if he could do Gerald any service
by seeing <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne he would do so.</p>

<p>They ascended the staircase with that peculiarly
soft step which one assumes when visiting a sick
person, although in this case it was wholly super-
fluous, as since her attack <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne had entirely
lost her sense of hearing.</p>

<p>As they entered the room the nurse motioned them
to be silent. The doctor was stooping over the sick
woman with an intent and anxious expression on his
face. It was evident a crisis was approaching.</p>

<p><q>Can we go near?</q> whispered Gerald to the
nurse.</p>

<p><q>Yes, but you had better not let her see you,</q> re-
plied the woman.</p>

<p><q>What!</q> exclaimed Gerald, with some agitation,
<q>does she, then, recognise anyone?</q></p>

<p><q>I fancied she did just now. But wait a mo-
ment.</q></p>

<p>She whispered a few words to the doctor; he
nodded, and she then beckoned Gerald and Kraker
to approach. In a few short hours a great change
had taken place. The body was still motionless, the
arms lay limp and nerveless in the coverlet, but the
face had lost the death-like hue and vacant expres-
sion which were so evident before. There was a
faint hectic flush on the cheeks, although the brow
and the lips were as white as the sheet. The eyes
had no longer a fixed unnatural stare, but were
illumined with a gleam of intelligence, while the
mouth, instead of being tightly closed over the teeth,
was relaxed, and once or twice the lips moved.</p>

<p><q>Has she spoken?</q> whispered Gerald to the
doctor.</p>

<p><q>Hush! keep in the shadow. She must not see
you yet,</q> he returned in a low voice.</p>

<p>A small lamp was placed on a table by one side of
the bed, opposite to that on which the doctor stood.
At the side of the doctor was the nurse, and Gerald
and Kraker kept in the shadow thrown from these
two.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence in the room for a few
minutes, broken only by the ticking of a watch on
the mantelshelf. It seemed as if the minutes had
the power of lengthening themselves, so slow did
they pass, and so measured were the monotonous
sounds.</p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1882-01-21 -->

<!-- episode printed 1882-01-28 -->

<p>Suddenly the doctor held up his hand. A faint
voice, scarcely audible, but marvellously distinct in
its articulation, was heard in the room.</p>

<p><q>Ernest, I am so tired; why do you not come?</q>
were the words that fell upon the ears of the awe-
struck listeners.</p>

<p><q>She has recovered her speech, but her mind
wanders. Of whom does she speak?</q> whispered the
doctor to Gerald.</p>

<p><q>Of my father,</q> returned the latter, pale, and
apparently much moved.</p>

<p><q>I have waited, oh! so long,</q> the sick woman
went on, speaking with difficulty. <q>If you knew
how I have longed for you you would come—yes, you
would come.</q></p>

<p>Again there was a pause. It evidently caused her
pain to speak; but, after resting awhile, she con-
tinued—</p>

<p><q>I have never deceived you. No; it is an enemy
who has spoken ill of me. Ah, why do you not come?
We were happy once, when I thought you poor. And
then——</q></p>

<p>At that moment the nurse moved on one side, and
the light fell on Kraker's face; the delirious creature
caught sight of it, and in a moment an expres-
sion of ecstatic joy came into her face. Holding out
her arms she cried, in a much stronger voice than she
had hitherto had—</p>

<p><q>Ah, I knew you would come, Ernest. Why did
you keep away so long from me?</q></p>

<p><q>She takes me for your father,</q> said Kraker.</p>

<p><q>Do not say anything; let her indulge her fancy,</q>
interposed the doctor.</p>

<p><q>It is a horrible dream. You did not really wish
to take our child, Ernest? No. Who is this? Not
my child; no.</q></p>

<p>And she turned with a look of disgust which,
despite the solemnity of the occasion, was almost
ludicrous.</p>

<p><q>No, I will never consent. It is wicked, monstrous,
unnatural. You love my boy? Yes; and do I not
also love him? Matilda <corr>Rennett</corr>!</q></p>

<p>Kraker started. It sounded so horrible to hear the
name of this murdered woman on the lips of one who
herself was so near death. Her voice, too, had
changed, and it was almost with a hoarse cry that
she called out—</p>

<p><q>Matilda <corr>Rennett</corr>,</q> she called again, <q>I forbid you.
I will never consent, I tell you. What! do you dare
to disobey me? Ah, he is gone!</q></p>

<p>A convulsive tremor seized her body, and with a
violent effort she tried to raise herself in bed. The
doctor and the nurse, however, soothed her, and by-
and-bye she laid down like a child.</p>

<p>The effort had exhausted her terribly, and she lay
panting for breath, each respiration seeming almost
to take the life from her body. The doctor adminis-
tered a stimulant, and in a few minutes she became
more composed. Her calmness, however, was decep-
tive. With a sudden energy, and with an amount
of strength simply astonishing, she turned herself on
the bed, and before the doctor or the nurse could
prevent her had sat up, looking, with her wan face
and streaming grey hair, like one raised from the
dead.</p>

<p><q>Ah!</q> she screamed, <q>it is my son who reproaches
his mother. See, he comes nearer; he strikes me.
Forgive me, my son, that I have injured you.
Pardon! pardon!</q> Her voice sank almost to a whis-
per, and now, in a voice which those who heard never
forgot, for it thrilled them to the very marrow, she
threw all her remaining strength into the utterance
of one word—<q><emph>Murderer!</emph></q></p>

<p>The next moment she fell back dead. For a few
minutes a profound silence fell upon that little group.
And then, naturally, three of the spectators turned
to the fourth, Gerald, who, of all those present, was
the most immediately concerned by what had just
happened.</p>

<p>No wonder he was intensely agitated. No wonder
that great drops of perspiration stood like beads
upon his forehead. No wonder his cheeks were livid,
and the lines in his face depressed. Such a scene
was enough to unman the most stoical, and Kraker
was not surprised to see the young man's emotion.</p>

<p><q>Come away for a little while,</q> whispered the
amateur detective. <q>You can do no good now, and
it is but distressing to remain.</q></p>

<p>He placed his hand on Gerald's arm, and gently led
him away from the bed. Gerald offered no resist-
ance, but when he was near the door he turned and
looked once more at her whom he once loved and re-
garded as a mother. The wild and troubled expres-
sion had passed from her face, and her features wore
that calm, placid expression which death so often
brings even to those whose lives have been evil. But
one glance, and a thrill seemed to pass over the
young man's frame. The next moment Kraker had
led him from the room.</p>

<p><q>You will stay awhile with me?</q> said he, after
they had reached his study, and Kraker had made
him swallow some spirits.</p>

<p><q>Stay? Of course I will. <emph>I</emph> am in no hurry,
never, you know.</q></p>

<p>And far into the small hours—for, somehow, rest
was not to be thought of with the remembrance of
that terrible death scene fresh before their eyes—
they sat, talking at intervals, and smoking, that
never-failing solace of men in the time of trouble.</p>

<p>About six the servants brought in coffee, and
soon after, the morning sun shining with increased
brilliancy after his temporary eclipse of the day
before, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker left Russell Square, and walked
pensively back to his lodgings.</p>

<p><q>Dead, and made no sign,</q> he muttered. <q>Well,
<emph>that</emph> way is stopped. Poor Gerald!</q></p>

<head type="num">Chapter XXI.</head>
<head type="main">The Unwinding of the Skein.</head>

<p>Lady Dorrington was one of the puzzles in human
nature to which age alone furnishes the key. In her
youth her beauty was of that order which at once
sets the heart of man in a glow, and sends the blood
coursing rapidly through the veins. While looking
at her one forgot to notice the shallowness of her
brain, and the selfishness of her disposition. In
middle age, when the greatness of her beauty had
waned, her real nature became more apparent, and
at fifty-five she was as good a specimen of the cal-
culating mercenary woman, without refinement of
soul, and without the true sympathy or weakness
which makes true feminine nobleness, as could well
be met with. The Earl of Annesley had, of course,
seen her from time to time in society, and as she
increased in years he more and more wondered to
himself how on earth he could ever have been in
love with her.</p>

<p>Florence Dorrington was the very opposite of her
mother. She had less beauty than had Lady Dor-
rington in her youth, but twice the intellect, and
was far beyond her in generosity and nobleness of
disposition. She resembled more her father, who
was a free-hearted and open-handed man, full of
animal spirits, and without a taint of selfishness.
Thus, it was hardly possible for two natures so
utterly at variance to agree. As a rule, Florence
gave way to her mother, and laughed while she
humoured her foibles. But this forbearance had
only reference to minor details. On any vital point
Florence could be as obstinate as Lady Dorrington.
It was, of course, impossible for the girl to keep her
attachment to Viscount Morleigh a secret—indeed,
when matters were brought to a climax by his arrest,
she at once made a confidant of her mother, in the
hopes of finding that sympathy she needed so much
at such a moment. Terribly was she disappointed.
Lady Dorrington expressed herself utterly scandal-
ised at the whole affair. It was bad enough to enter
into a clandestine engagement, but to continue it
under such circumstances was simply, so she said,
indelicate. The illegitimacy of the Viscount had,
in some curious roundabout way, got noised abroad;
it was known, at all events, that the Earl had re-
fused him all assistance, and, with this in view,
Lady Dorrington was horrified at her daughter's
persistence. Then ensued a stormy scene, in which
neither mother nor daughter would give way, and
the result was that for nearly two days not a word
passed between the two. But, whatever may have
been the disposition of Lady Dorrington, it was not
in the nature of Florence to be at variance long
with anyone, and she was the first to hold out the
olive branch. It is true the breach was not com-
pletely healed, but, by a sort of tacit understanding,
each carefully avoided the dangerous ground, and on
third day when they met at the breakfast table there
was nothing to indicate to a stranger that within the
last few hours, and, for the first time in their lives,
they had had a most violent quarrel. Florence kissed
her mother as usual, and sat down at the table. By
her plate was a letter, the writing on the envelope un-
familiar to her. A few days before she would at
once have made some remark upon this circumstance,
but now her mouth was closed. She knew not what
the letter might contain; she had an instinctive
feeling of dread when she saw the strange hand-
writing, and, though anxious to know its contents,
dared not break the seal. It, accordingly, lay un-
opened on the table.</p>

<p><q>Are you going out to-day, Florence?</q> inquired
her mother after a pause, during which both had
been going through the form—for it was little more
—of breakfasting.</p>

<p><q>No—that is, perhaps I may,</q> returned the
young lady absently.</p>

<p><q>You do not expect any visitors, I suppose?</q>
<corr>continued</corr> Lady Dorrington, with just the slightest
tinge of sarcasm in her tone. <q>Of course, it doesn't
matter to me; still, I may be excused if I am desir-
ous of saving trouble. Not that you need consider
<emph>me</emph>. I am past that, and do not expect it,</q> she
added, with an air of resignation.</p>

<p><q>Dear mamma, you know that I wish to consider
you. I am sure I have always given way to you in
everything, excepting——</q></p>

<p><q>There, Florence, pray do not make any refer-
ence to that very painful subject. I'm sure my
nerves are upset <emph>quite</emph> sufficiently already;</q> and the
dowager sniffed vigorously at her vinaigrette.</p>

<p><q>I have said all I intended, mamma,</q> returned
the girl quietly.</p>

<p><q>I'm sure it's a wonder I have not been seized
with some terrible illness. I hope I may not be;
though what I have gone through has been enough to
try the strongest constitution. Thank heaven,</q> she
ejaculated piously, <q>I have nothing to reproach
<emph>myself</emph> with.</q></p>

<p>Florence did not reply, but bending her head over
her cup, toyed carelessly with the spoon. Every
word her mother uttered went like a dagger to her
heart; but she had made up her mind never again
to introduce the subject of her attachment, unless
absolutely obliged by unforeseen circumstances, and
she simply held her tongue.</p>

<p>After a few observations to the effect that she sup-
posed it was now the duty of a mother to sacrifice
herself for her children, though when she was young
things were very different; that when she was dead
and gone perhaps her words would be remembered,
that it was always the fate of those who desired the
happiness and wellbeing of others to be misunder-
stood, and various other reflections of more or less
inane wisdom, Lady Dorrington at length arose from
the table and intimated her intention—not without
expressing a hope that her daughter's plans would
not be at all interfered with thereby—she was now
very desirous that Florence should have her own
way in everything—of dressing for the purpose of
going out.</p>

<p><q>No doubt, you have made your own arrange-
ments, Florence,</q> she added, with much humility,
as she rose from her seat. <q>Pray do not alter any-
thing on my account</q> (for Florence had murmured
something about accompanying her if she so desired).
And she swept out of the room with a dignified air,
without waiting for her daughter's reply.</p>

<p>Florence sat for a few moments with her head still
bent, and a tear rolled down her pallid cheek. <q>It
is cruel of mamma. She will drive me mad.</q> And
then her gaze fell on the letter, and taking it she
rose from her chair and went slowly towards the
window. After a moment's hesitation she broke the
seal. On reading the first few lines her face bright-
ened, but when she reached the end it had resumed
its old sadness. <q>Not a word of encouragement,</q>
she said half aloud to herself with a sigh. <q>He
does not say so, but I know he still believes Frank is
guilty. Oh, how can anyone be so blind?</q></p>

<p>The letter was from Edward Preston, and simply
said that he had visited the Viscount, and had had a
long conversation with him. He had placed the
case, with the concurrence of the solicitor, into <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Roxby's hands, and would do his best to assist him.
It was a half formal, half friendly note, but cer-
tainly not written in a sanguine, or even a hopeful
spirit. It was a bitter disappointment to Florence,
for, turning first of all to the signature, she saw it
was from the young barrister, and had immediately
jumped to the conclusion that Viscount Morleigh had
convinced him of his innocence. But not a word of
this was there in the note from beginning to end,
and this reed, on which for the last few days she had
rested for comfort, taken from her, she felt herself
the most miserable creature on earth.</p>

<p>While she was thus standing pensively against
the window Lady Dorrington, dressed for walking,
entered the room.</p>

<p><q>I don't think I shall be home in time for lun-
cheon,</q> said the dowager. <q>I want to go to West-
bourne Grove, and I think I shall call at the
Moltenos. I know they lunch about one, and that
will suit me admirably. Can I do anything for you,
my dear?</q></p>

<p><q>No, thank you, mamma,</q> returned Florence,
with her face half averted, for she was too proud to
let her mother see the traces of grief on her coun-
tenance.</p>

<p>A little pony carriage was at the door, and into
this Lady Dorrington got; the neatest of pages fol-
lowed, Lady Dorrington gathered up the reins with
the air of an experienced horsewoman, touched the
pony gently with the whip, and the carriage rattled
off down the broad drive.</p>

<p>Full of wretchedness, intensified by the thought
that she was utterly unable to help her lover, Flor-
ence leaned her head against the window frame, and
looked out into the bright sunlight. The house was
an old-fashioned one, but had been modernised by
Lady Dorrington to the extent of having French
windows, and as the girl stood the light fell upon
her profile and outline of her figure with a charm-
ing picturesque effect, and with her dejected
attitude, full of grace, despite its mournfulness and
beautiful profile, she would have served for an artist's
ideal of Penseroso.</p>

<p>So absorbed was she with her own sad thoughts
she did not notice that someone had entered the
garden. The sound, however, of a footstep crunch-
ing the gravel recalled her wandering senses, and
then she saw a stranger, whose eccentric behaviour
at first gave her some alarm that a lunatic had some-
how made his way in. He was a little man, very
neatly dressed, and carrying an irreproachable um-
brella. When Florence first caught sight of him he
was standing firmly planted on his legs, which were
a little wide apart, holding the umbrella, with both
hands, across his shoulder. In this attitude he stood
surveying the house with a critical air for at least a
minute. Then, with a sudden wheel, he turned him-
self right round and stood looking at the wall which
divided the garden from the road.</p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1882-01-28 -->

<!-- episode printed 1882-02-04 -->

<p>By-and-bye he stooped down and picked up a hand-
ful of gravel, heedless of the fact that he was seriously
imperilling the hitherto spotless condition of his
black kid gloves. The natural supposition of Miss
Dorrington on seeing this act was that the intruder
had some designs upon the windows, and she was
relieved, though in no way less puzzled, to see that
he placed some of the gravel in an envelope, fastened
up the latter, and carefully put it into his pocket.
One turn towards the huge old-fashioned gates, a
moment's inspection, and then the little man turned
sharply round and walked briskly up to the house.</p>

<p><q>What an extraordinary man! Who can he be,
and whatever can he want?</q> was Florence's very
natural ejaculation. <q>I hope Mary will not let him
in. How unfortunate mamma has gone out.</q></p>

<p>The next moment the maid entered the room.</p>

<p><q>A gentleman to see you, miss, on pertikler busi-
ness.</q></p>

<p><q>You have not left him in the hall, Mary, I hope.
I saw him come up the path, and he's been behaving
himself so strangely that I'm afraid he's not right
in his head.</q></p>

<p><q>He <emph>would</emph> come in, miss,</q> returned the girl; <q>and
here's his card.</q></p>

<p>Florence took the piece of pasteboard, and read—</p>

<p><q>Matthew Kraker,</q> and then in the corner was
written <q>by favour of Edward Preston,</q> in the same
handwriting as the letter which reached her that
morning.</p>

<p><q>How strange,</q> she murmured, <q>but there can
be no harm, for this most certainly is <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston's
writing. But who is <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker?</q></p>

<p>This was a question, however, to which she could
in the absence of the gentleman so named return no
satisfactory answer, and, accordingly, bidding the
maid to show <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker in, she awaited with some
curiosity her visitor.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker's long residence on the continent had
given him a perfect ease of manner, and he intro-
duced himself to Miss Dorrington like a gentleman.
Whatever eccentricity he might have displayed in
the garden it had certainly disappeared in the draw-
ing room.</p>

<p><q>I need not ask you, Miss Dorrington, if you
wonder at my presence here to-day. It may startle
you, perhaps, to know that it is through my agency
that Viscount Morleigh lies this moment in prison.</q></p>

<p>The blood for a moment dyed the girl's cheeks and
then left them ashen pale. She half rose indignantly
from the couch, and was about to express her aston-
ishment, when <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, without manifesting the
least disquietude, interrupted her.</p>

<p><q>Do not alarm yourself, Miss Dorrington, I beg.
I repeat that it is I who have traced this crime, and
I may tell you that never have I had a case in which
I was more positive I had put my finger on the per-
petrator.</q></p>

<p><q>But——</q> exclaimed Florence.</p>

<p><q>There, there, you ladies are so impatient. Just
one moment, and you shall ask me as many questions
as you please, and say what you like. I repeat that
never before have I been so self-confident, and, as a
natural consequence, I have been blinded on several
little points which I ought not to have overlooked.</q></p>

<p>Florence gazed at him in a bewildered fashion, and
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, with a complacent air, continued—</p>

<p><q>The fact is, I am a detective, but I must ask you,
as a particular favour, to keep the matter a secret if
ever anyone should ask you who Matthew Kraker is.
Very well, so much for yourself. Now, Miss Dorring-
ton, I want you, if you please, to listen to a little
story. It's something of what is called the <soCalled>sensa-
tional</soCalled> order, but I believe that is a rather favourable
quality in a story—not that I can speak positively on
this point, for I only deal in fact, never in fiction.
However, you must take what I am going to say as
simply a romance from the circulating library. Don't
fancy it's true, and then you'll be better able to hear
me out to the end.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker spoke in his easy, calm, persuasive
voice, and, reassured by his manner, Florence bowed
her assent, and the amateur detective then went on
to relate in a succinct and graphic manner, first the
discovery of the murder, and then the circum-
stances which had led him to fix the crime on the
Viscount. With wonderful calmness Florence heard
him to the end, but as he unfolded every detail with
logical clearness, and showed how each step he had
taken led him towards the same goal, she felt as
though she were on a solitary rock which the sea was
slowly but surely undermining, and which ere long
must crumble into dust.</p>

<p><q>Now,</q> resumed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, <q>against all this
there is but one thing, and that is Viscount Mor-
leigh's point blank denial. Under ordinary circum-
stances, and in a common-place crime, I should not
attach much importance to this fact, but in a case of
such intricacy it becomes very important. But I
won't trouble you with my theories, which may be
true or false, but simply come to the object of my
visit. The murder was committed on the 27th of
May——</q></p>

<p><q>I beg your pardon, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker,</q> exclaimed
Florence, starting. <q>What day did you say?</q></p>

<p><q>The 27th,</q> returned the detective, gazing curi-
ously on the agitated features of the young girl.</p>

<p><q>Great heaven!</q> murmured Florence; <q>it cannot
be. There is some dreadful mistake. No; he is
innocent: I am certain of it. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker,</q> she
resumed, trembling with excitement, <q>pray tell me
what time of the day?</q></p>

<p>Her face was flushed, and her eyes sparkling as she
asked the question.</p>

<p><q>I have fixed it at ten o'clock; at all events not
earlier than half-past nine.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank heaven!</q> cried the girl, starting to her
feet, and pressing her hand to her bosom to calm its
throbbing. <q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker!</q> she exclaimed with
animation, <q>I cannot thank you enough. Viscount
Morleigh is innocent. I can prove it.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker's answer was to take out his snuff-box,
tap it three times, and take a pinch with infinite
satisfaction.</p>

<p><q>You can prove it?</q> said he at last; <q>how?</q></p>

<p><q>Because Viscount Morleigh,</q> began Florence
impetuously, and then she stopped and hesitated,
blushing deeply meanwhile. After a pause she said,
quietly, <q>From half-past nine to ten Viscount Mor-
leigh was here—at this house.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker nodded half at Florence and half to
himself—</p>

<p><q>Anybody see him besides yourself?</q></p>

<p>Again Florence blushed.</p>

<p><q>No, unfortunately. The truth is,</q> she added,
<q>Viscount Morleigh came here secretly, to see me on
a very important matter. I met him in the garden.
The gate was locked, and he climbed over the wall.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker closed his snuff-box with a sharp noise,
and exclaimed—</p>

<p><q>I thought so.</q> Then jumping to his feet, he
said, with some eagerness in his manner, <q>Miss Dor-
rington, you have removed a doubt from my mind.
Will you have the kindness to take me to the place
where Viscount Morleigh climbed?</q></p>

<p>Florence now saw the meaning of her visitor's
eccentric actions in the garden a short time previ-
ously. He had evidently a strong suspicion of the
truth.</p>

<p>No, she had no objection; indeed, why should she
have? She was now as full of hope as she had before
been plunged in dejection; so, opening one of the
French windows, she stepped out on to the lawn.
Kraker followed her to the wall, which was about
seven feet in height, very old, and filled in the inter-
stices between the brick with moss. Florence stopped
near a tree of the <foreign>arbor vit&#xe6;</foreign> kind.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> said she, <q>this is as near as possible the
spot, because a few drops of rain were falling, and I
sheltered myself under this tree.</q></p>

<p>There was a broad flowerbed running the whole
length of the wall, and Kraker, stepping lightly on
to the mould, examined carefully the surface.</p>

<p><q>The Viscount must have jumped from the top
rather violently,</q> said he, after a pause.</p>

<p><q>Yes. How he managed to climb on the wall
without cutting himself on the broken bottles, I
cannot imagine. But how did you discover it?</q></p>

<p><q>By these two deep footprints. Although made
some days ago, and in spite of the rain we have had,
they are still plainly distinguishable. If you look at
them carefully you will see that the heel has touched
the ground first. Had he lowered himself by means
of his hands the toes would have been the first to
touch, and the impression would have been fainter;
indeed, I don't suppose we should now have found
any trace.</q></p>

<p><q>You are quite right, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker. The Viscount
jumped so violently that he slipped, and tore the
knee of his trousers.</q></p>

<p><q>By Jove!</q> muttered the detective, <q>facts beat
fiction after all. No one could believe such a coin-
cidence possible but those who actually witness it.
Have you such a thing as a ladder on the premises,
Miss Dorrington?</q> he added.</p>

<p><q>We have a pair of steps,</q> said she. <q>There
they are hanging against the shed.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker skipped across the garden with the
activity of a boy, seized the steps, carried them to
the wall, mounted them, and examined the broken
glass on the wall minutely, not disdaining even the
use of a magnifying glass. For a few minutes he
was silent, and then he uttered a cry of joy.</p>

<p><q>It is the most complete <foreign>alibi</foreign> I have ever seen.</q></p>

<p>He descended to the ground, and showed Florence
a strip of grey kid.</p>

<p><q>The Viscount wore grey gloves, as I told you.
This strip was torn off when climbing the wall. I
don't think I need trouble you any further, Miss
Dorrington. Make your mind perfectly easy as to
the result.</q></p>

<p>He was about to take his leave when Florence,
looking at him, said—</p>

<p><q>Shall you be seeing <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Preston?</q></p>

<p><q>No doubt. He is much interested in this case,
and as he knows I have called upon you he will be
anxious to learn the result.</q></p>

<p><q>And you will tell him?</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly.</q></p>

<p>She paused for a moment, and then said—</p>

<p><q>Would you mind adding a few words from me?
I have not told you why the Viscount came that
night. We were engaged, but both my mother and
the Earl were averse, and, indeed, we never hoped to
have their consent. The Viscount had proposed to
me a secret marriage, and it was to learn my deci-
sion that he visited me that evening. It is, perhaps,
of not much importance, but I should like <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Preston to know it. Thank you again, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker.
But for your wonderful acuteness I should be the
most miserable creature alive. When—when do you
think he will be released?</q></p>

<p><q>Probably at the next examination, but don't be
under any anxiety on that score.</q> And with a re-
spectable bow he bade her adieu.</p>

<p><q>Ah, ah! I see it all now, clear as daylight. The
Viscount was too jealous of the lady's reputation to
compromise her even in the slightest degree. Well,
it does him all the more credit. But, hang it! what
credit shall <emph>I</emph> get out of the affair? The Viscount is
innocent, that's certain. Who, then, are interested
in the murder? The Earl and the woman now lying
dead in Russell Square. Those are the only two, and,
of course, the woman is out of the question. As for
poor Gerald, he was a decided loser, although, as
events have turned out, he's not much to be pitied.
It will be odd, though, if, when the Viscount is
cleared, he chooses to assert his rights. Well, well,
what he will do is nothing to me just now. I have
to find the murderer of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett, and how to do
it I can't tell. I am fairly at my wits' ends.</q> And
in a very uncomfortable state of mind he hurried off
to Scotland Yard to report the sudden change in the
state of affairs.</p>

<p>Superintendent Parkinson looked up from a mass
of official documents on the table before him, and
greeted <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker with pleasure.</p>

<p><q>You're just the man I wanted. Read that,</q>
said he.</p>

<p>It was a telegraphic message, dated from Folk-
stone, and ran as follows:—</p>

<p><q>I have found the man with the earrings. I shall
bring him to town to-night. <persName rend="sc">Forrest.</persName></q></p>

<head type="main">The Man with the Earrings.</head>

<p><q>Well, Kraker, and what do you think of that?</q>
asked the Superintendent.</p>

<p><q>I cannot say. Since I last saw you events have
taken a curious turn. In the first place, Viscount
Morleigh is innocent.</q></p>

<p><q>The deuce he is!</q> exclaimed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson. <q>But
what about the evidence against him?</q></p>

<p><q>Strong at first sight, but nothing when his reply
has been heard. I firmly believe that he has no more
to do with the murder than you or I.</q></p>

<p><q>You astound me. I hope you haven't got us into
trouble,</q> said the Superintendent, sternly. <q>Re-
member it was on your responsibility, and at your
persuasion that he was arrested.</q></p>

<p><q>Quite so; and I am not sure that his arrest will
not lead us on the right track.</q></p>

<p><q>How? Have you, then, spotted the real mur-
derer?</q></p>

<p><q>Not yet, but the circle has become so narrow
that I have not much fear on that score.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson did not reply. He was considerably
disturbed by this intelligence of Kraker's, and he
began to have doubts if his over-refinement and
subtlety were, after all, quite so effective, practi-
cally, as the rough and ready, common-place reason-
ing of Forrest and his colleagues. Still, whether this
was so or not, his extraordinary powers of observation
had certainly been verified by evidence altogether
identical with that which he had deduced theoretic-
ally, and though it was but a series of coincidences
the fact was none the less wonderful.</p>

<p><q>You are surprised and disappointed, naturally,</q>
went on <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, <q>but you shall hear what I
have to say, and then we will see to-night what
tidings Forrest will bring.</q></p>

<p>And briefly he told the result of his interview with
Miss Dorrington, and the story, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson owned,
placed the Viscount's innocence beyond a doubt.</p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1882-02-04 -->

<!-- episode printed 1882-02-11 -->

<p><q>Well, we seem to have got to a very pretty dead-
lock. But I can't stay just now to discuss it, for I
have an appointment at two, and it now wants two
minutes of the hour.</q></p>

<p><q>Shall I look in again?</q></p>

<p><q>Um! Well, I shall not be more than half-an-
hour; if you like to wait I can talk the matter over
when I come back.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well, I am in no hurry. I can stay.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson left the room, and Matthew Kraker,
sitting down by the table, took up the newspaper.
Five minutes of this sufficed him, and then he glanced
about in search of something more interesting. There
were three or four official-looking documents lying
about, and he seized the nearest. It was a list of
property found in cabs during the month of May.
Umbrellas and opera glasses formed the staple com-
modities, of bags there were not a few, parcels a
good number, and of overcoats a fair number. Care-
lessly he looked down the list, and his eye rested
upon one item at which he stared fixedly for some
moments:—</p>

<p><q>A light grey paletot found in a hansom on the
27th of May. Fare got in at Turnham Green. Cab-
man's number, 1,468. Coat not given up till 2nd
June, cabman having been ill.</q></p>

<p><q>I must see this paletot,</q> he muttered to him-
self, <q>if Forrest's man with the earrings turns out a
failure.</q></p>

<p>He was very fidgetty till the Superintendent re-
turned, which was not until three o'clock. <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Parkinson then declared he could not go into the
matter, as he had received some information on a
governmental matter which demanded his instant
attention. It would be better to put it off till the
evening when Forrest returned, and in this <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Kraker concurred.</p>

<p>Seven o'clock was the time Forrest was expected to
arrive, and precisely at this hour <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, for the
second time that day, entered Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Forrest had been more than punctual, and when
Matthew Kraker walked into the room he was already
closetted with the Superintendent. The rival detec-
tives shook hands, Forrest with an ill-concealed air
of triumph, Matthew Kraker even more subdued and
quiet than was his wont.</p>

<p><q>I hope you have been more successful in tracking
the right man than I have been,</q> said he.</p>

<p><q>Ah! you wouldn't believe me,</q> rejoined <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Forrest, in a boastful tone.</p>

<p><q>Well, so long as you have secured the murderer I
do not regret my failure.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrest straightened himself, threw back his
shoulders, and literally as well as metaphorically
rose above his companion.</p>

<p><q>I understand that you have made a little mis-
take?</q></p>

<p><q>You have not been misinformed,</q> replied Kraker,
calmly.</p>

<p><q>Nothing new in a beginner, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker. I will
give you the credit of a most ingenious theory, but
when you have had my experience you will throw
theory to the winds, and take to practice.</q></p>

<p><q>When I do so I will most assuredly come to you
for advice, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrest,</q> replied <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker in ap-
parently the most friendly tone.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrest looked at the little man as if uncertain
whether he spoke the truth or not. He did not re-
ply, however, and the Superintendent, deeming that
sufficient time had been spent in official amenities,
put an end to the conversation by handing to Kraker
a report written by Forrest of the inquiries he had
made. The substance of this was that the man, who
gave his name as Harry Carboy, had been traced
down the river as far as Irongate Wharf, and here he
had gone on board one of the Yarmouth boats, and
taken a third-class passage to Yarmouth. Once
arrived at Yarmouth, Forrest had little difficulty in
finding his man, for it had turned out that he was a
native of the place, and though for many years had
been abroad as a sailor, had now returned, and
for some time past had been employed as a fisher-
man.</p>

<p>When arrested on suspicion of having murdered
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett, he exhibited the utmost astonishment,
and, indeed, Forrest declared he never saw a man in
such a state of fright before. He said very little
beyond protesting his innocence, and did not offer
much objection to <corr>accompanying</corr> the officer to
London.</p>

<p>This was all that Forrest had discovered, and it
could not be said that it threw much light on the
affair. One point alone was settled. Carboy, in the
course of conversation with Forrest, had admitted
that he had visited <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett on the morning
when he was seen at Hammersmith. He, therefore,
had some acquaintance with her, and some motive
for making the visit; what that motive was had yet
to be discovered.</p>

<p><q>What is your opinion now, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker?</q> asked
the Superintendent.</p>

<p><q>I must compliment <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrest on his persever-
ance,</q> said he, guardedly. <q>Carboy has no more to
do with the matter than I have,</q> he said inwardly.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson was about to reply when a message
came by a sergeant to the effect that the prisoner
wished to make a statement. This gave an unex-
pected turn to the proceeding, and Forrest's eye
lightened at the thought that in all probability Car-
boy was about to make a confession, and thus, in
addition to setting the matter at rest, complete the
glory which he felt was about to attach to himself as
the man who had solved the mystery of the Hammer-
smith tragedy.</p>

<p>The order having been given, the prisoner, care-
fully guarded, was brought into the room. He was a
tall, broad-chested fellow, with a slight stoop in his
shoulders, and face tanned by the sun and wind to the
colour of mahogany. His hair and whiskers were
grizzled, and his age certainly not less than sixty.
In his ears were the earrings which had led to his
detection. He looked round the room in a dazed
kind of way, and made a rough sailor-like salute to
the Superintendent.</p>

<p>The latter at once dipped his pen in the ink, and
took a sheet of foolscap.</p>

<p><q>You wish to make a statement, I am informed.</q></p>

<p><q>Aye; that's just it, yer honour. I've bin a-
turning over this 'ere business.</q></p>

<p><q>Stay,</q> interrupted <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson, <q>I want you
to clearly understand that I'm going to write down
all you say, and this will be produced against you at
your trial. You know the meaning of that, eh?</q></p>

<p><q>Aye, yer honour, I knows it,</q> answered the man
slowly. <q>I'm not afraid o' that. 'Taint that I want
to talk about. It's summat as happened years and
years agone. I've had nought to do with that poor
creature's death, as I told this gentleman here.
Didn't I?</q> said he, turning to Forrest.</p>

<p><q>If he has nothing to say about the murder it's
simply a waste of time,</q> said the Superintendent in
an undertone to Forrest and Kraker.</p>

<p><q>I would not be too sure of that,</q> rejoined Kraker.
<q>If he is not the murderer he may know something
to lead us on the right track.</q></p>

<p>Forrest looked rather disgusted at Kraker's im-
plied doubt of the guilt of the prisoner, but he passed
it over, and simply said that he concurred with him
in asking that the man might be heard.</p>

<p>Very well.</p><!-- should be speech? -->

<p><q>What is your name?</q> said he to the man.</p>

<p><q>Stephen—that is, they always called me Steve—
Rennett,</q> was his unexpected answer.</p>

<p><q>Rennett!</q> repeated the Superintendent, consider-
ably startled. <q>Why, you gave the officer the name
of Carboy.</q></p>

<p><q>It's Rennett, yer honour, and no other,</q> said the
sailor, positively. <q>I've bin called Carboy since
I've come back from Medtrayun. I was in a Lewant
coaster for ten years backwards and forwards,</q> said
he, by way of explanation.</p>

<p><q>Very well, Stephen Rennett, and how old are
you?</q></p>

<p><q>Sixty-five come next Michaelmas Day. I was
married to my wife, Tilda—her that's gone,</q> said
he, with a peculiar jerk of his head—<q>thirty-five
year come that day. She was a pretty-like thing
then, too young for me, maybe, but I was that fond
of her I'd——</q></p>

<p>The sailor stopped, and passed the back of his
freckled hand across his eyes.</p>

<p><q>The husband of Matilda Rennett,</q> muttered
Kraker to himself. <q>After all, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Forrest, you
have not wasted your time.</q></p>

<p><q>Aye,</q> resumed the old man, <q>I was thirty, and
she was eighteen. People said as we'd never pull our
oars together, but I thort as she'd grow to like me,
and I wasn't afeared, and so we got spliced. We
went on purty well for a time, but I soon found as
I'd made a mistake. You can't put new and old
rigging together, nohow. I didn't blame her, not I,
'cause she was fond o' finery and fallals, and liked
going out and about; but I thort she didn't care for
me as she onest did, d'ye see, and—but theer, yer
honours, I ain't a-going to open an old sore, and, to
make a long story short, we got to having hard
words—perhaps I was a bit jealous, yer know—and
at last she left me, and went into service as a nuss,
soon after our babby was born.</q></p>

<p>The story had begun to be interesting to Matthew
Kraker, who saw at a glance the important bearing
it had upon the romantic history the fragments of
which he had for so long been trying his hardest
to piece together. He could not restrain his impa-
tience.</p>

<p><q>I beg your pardon,</q> said he to the Superinten-
dent, <q>but will you ask him the name of the family
in whose service his wife entered?</q></p>

<p>The man's quick ears caught the question.</p>

<p><q>I war a coming to that,</q> said he. <q>It was
Lady Annesley's. Tilly'd been waiting maid to the
old Countess afore the Earl married, and so she easily
got a place, d'ye see, at the Hall. Well, she hadn't
been there a month or more afore I got rather pining
like, 'specially as the blessed babe had gone dead,
and so I couldn't bear it no longer, and off I goes to
the Hall at Chalton.</q></p>

<p><q>Where is Chalton?</q> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker.</p>

<p><q>About fifteen mile from Yarmouth, yer honour.
As I was sayin', off I goes. I went up to the Hall, and
asks for Tilda Rennett. She comes out, and, says she,
<q>What do you want here?</q> and looks as black as
I've never seen her look afore. <q>Why, lass,</q> I
says, <q>I've come to take 'ee home.</q> Says she,
<q>Yo' might ha' saved thyself the trouble. I'm no
coming home.</q> Well, I went away pretty nigh
heartbroken, but I wasn't going to give her up, and
so next day I went back again, and many more times,
till she began to give way a little, and I thought all
'ud come square and taut again. But one evening,
when I was talking to her, she says, all of a sudden
like, <q>Steve,</q> says she, <q>have you a mind to earn
some money?</q> <q>If it's to spend it on you, lass,</q> I
says. <q>Oh, you can spend it on me,</q> she says,
with a laugh and a toss of her head—she allays had
pretty ways—<q>but,</q> says she, <q>I must know to-
night.</q> <q>What's it to do?</q> I says. <q>Oh,
nothing much, only to go with me on a journey.</q>
<q>If that's all,</q> I says, <q>I'll go with yo' to the end
of the world.</q></q></p>

<p><q>This is a fearful rigmarole,</q> muttered the
Superintendent. <q>What it has to do with the
murder I can't for the life of me see.</q></p>

<p>However, he still went on writing, and Rennett
continued:</p>

<p><q>Well, she said no more that night, but bit by bit
it came out that the Countess was staying at Hagley,
in Yorkshire, and that my wife was to take the
young lord she was a nursing of down to my lady.
The Earl's steward, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Taplow, was to have taken
charge of her and the young baby lord, but he'd took
ill with the fever, and the Earl wanted someone to
take his place, and so Tilda had spoken of me. So
away we started in a fine po'shay, and everything
very grand, and on the way down it comes out what
the money was to be given for. The Earl, d'ye see,
didn't care a rope's end for the Countess, but had
fallen in love with some fine lady up in Lunnon.
Both on 'em had been brought to bed at the same
time, and the Earl wanted to put away the rightful
heir, and put the other in his place. When I heard
that I was a'most thunderstruck, and I swore I
wouldn't have nought to do with such a black busi-
ness. But my wife all'us had a wheedling tongue,
and she somehow quieted me, 'specially as she was
to have a good round sum paid to her every year for
adoing of it. But I didn't half like it, and when we
met the lady at the inn at Pagleton, where we was
to change the children, I'd a'most made up my mind
to back out. Howsomever, the time came, and my
wife took off the fine laces and silks of the young
lord, and put 'em on the other, and they was so like
as you couldn't tell t'other from which, and then we
was just agoing off when the lady she busts into a
fit of crying, and she wouldn't be parted from her
boy. Said I to myself, <q>That's right.</q> I says, <q>A
mother oughtn't to sell her own flesh and blood,</q> and
I ups and stops Tilda, who'd just ordered the po'shay
to go on. The lady took on so that we couldn't bear
to see her, and says I, <q>What's to pervent our taking
on the young lord? I'll swear as his father can't
tell one babby from another. If he thinks as he's
changed he'll just be as well pleased as if he really
was. The lady here'll wont lose her little one, and
all parties 'll have their own way.</q></q></p>

<p>His recital was suddenly interrupted by an ex-
clamation from <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, which, however, he said
was nothing more than a spasm to which he was
subject.</p>

<p><q>Well, yer honour, that's what we agreed to do.
Tilda took off the clothes again, changed 'em, and,
so as there shouldn't be any mistake, the lady writes
out two bits of paper telling all about it, and we all
puts our names, and she keeps one of the papers her-
self and gives one to my wife.</q></p>

<p><q>There is the missing link; the object of the
murderer was to destroy this paper,</q> thought <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Kraker.</p>

<p>The man had ceased speaking, and was fumbling
in his pocket. At last he drew forth a greasy
leather pocket book, and opening it took out, after
some little search, a piece of folded paper, yellow
with age.</p>

<p><q>Look at that there dockyment, gents, and see if
I ain't spoke the truth. I never let Tilda keep it;
she was such a giddy thing, I didn't trust her.</q></p>

<p>It was even so. The paper, as Rennett had stated,
was a kind of affidavit establishing the legitimacy of
Viscount Morleigh, and signed by Louisa Delanne,
Matilda Rennett, and Stephen Rennett. Of the
three men who listened to this romantic story Kraker
alone possessed the key. The other two were puzzled
and stupefied, not without a glimmering suspicion
that it had something to do with the murder; but
where the connecting link was they had not the
slightest idea. The Superintendent would have
like to have put a number of questions, but he dared
not. It would be immediately said that he had been
trying to make the prisoner commit himself, and
that, of course, is contrary to our notions of law and
justice. He contented himself with asking the man
whether he had anything more to say.</p>

<p><q>No, I dunno as I have,</q> returned the old man,
scratching his head slowly. <q>I've told you all
'cept as I went to see her, poor lass, two days afore
she was found dead. I hadn't seen her for pretty
nigh twenty year, though I knowed where she lived
through Lawyer Farnham, as managed my lord's
business, and, somehow, I'd a hankering to see her
once more afore I was paid off, and so I went and
got to her house on a Sunday morning. But, Lord
love ye, sirs, I war such a fule, when I got to the
house I dursn't go in, and, after hanging about an
hour or so, blest if I didn't go straight back to Yar-
mouth, and never seed her at all.</q></p>

<p><q>Confound it,</q> muttered the Superintendent;
<q>Forrest's inquiry has turned out worse than
Kraker's. This man is innocent, I'll take my
oath.</q></p>

<p>Forrest heard the half-suppressed words of his
superior, and reddened with anger and vexation.
However, he said nothing. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson again
asked the man if he had anything further to state,
and, on his replying in the negative, ordered him to
be removed. <q>He may be useful as a witness,
Forrest,</q> he observed, when the man had gone,
<q>but as a prisoner, no. Whoever is the guilty party
it certainly is not this sailor.</q></p>

<p>Nothing more could be done that night. As
matters appeared, the mystery was as far off being
solved as ever it was, and, in no very good humour,
the Superintendent bade both Kraker and Forrest
good-night.</p>

<p><q>By-the-way, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson, I wish you would
give me an order to examine some of this lost pro-
perty of which you have here a list. I've a notion
that something I noticed among the articles may be
useful.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson at once complied, and Matthew
Kraker, armed with this order, took his leave.</p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1882-02-11 -->




<!-- episode printed 1882-02-18 -->

<p>The light thrown upon the mystery by the story of
Stephen Rennett strangely agitated Matthew Kraker.
Looked at calmly, to what conclusion did it point?
Four persons were interested in the death of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Rennett—the Earl of Annesley, Viscount Morleigh,
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne, and Gerald. The innocence of the
Viscount, to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker's mind, was firmly estab-
lished. The Earl, being absent from England at the
time of the murder was committed, could scarcely have
had a hand in it; <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Delanne, he considered, was
out of the question; and there thus remained only
Gerald. Gerald! Impossible! The very notion
sent a thrill through his frame. Gerald, with whom
he had had for years a close friendship, whose noble-
ness he had so lately been eulogising! No, it could
not be. Was it not likely, rather, that Rennett had
concocted this story than that Gerald Delanne should
have committed so foul, so fiendish a crime? Matthew
Kraker would have given worlds if he could thus
have calmed his inquietude, but he could not so
deceive himself. Rennett, he felt convinced, spoke
the truth. There had been no substitution, after all.
Gerald had accidentally made the discovery, and, in
pursuance of his diabolical scheme, had silenced the
only person who could have foiled him. Her hus-
band, of course, he believed dead, as, indeed, did
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rennett herself. And yet, in spite of this
logical deduction, in spite of his own judgment,
Kraker could not bring himself to such a belief.
There must be some mystery he had not yet fathomed,
some clue which had evaded him.</p>

<p>For years Matthew Kraker had not felt so deeply
moved as he did at this moment. Ordinarily he was
a man of little emotion, conscientious to a fault, but
above the weaknesses which so often form the motive
power of men's actions. He had seen so much of the
dark side of human nature that the identification of
an individual hitherto supposed incapable of crime
with a miscreant of evil thoughts and actions rarely
surprised him, but in this instance he was thoroughly
unnerved.</p>

<p><q>I can stand it no longer,</q> he muttered despe-
rately, as he strode along with his eyes fixed on the
ground and his hands deep in his pockets; <q>I can
see no other way but to go direct to Gerald, and tell
him this story of Stephen Rennett's. I shall then
find out whether this horrible suspicion be correct or
not.</q></p>

<p>His resolution taken, he determined upon going the
next morning to Russell Square. It was about eleven
o'clock when he arrived.</p>

<p>As he approached the house he saw that a carriage
and pair was waiting in front.</p>

<p><q>The doctor's, I suppose?</q> he muttered. <q>And
yet, what can he want? The poor woman's been
dead three days.</q></p>

<p>It was nothing to him, but he was so used to
theorise on the power of arriving at the known from
the unknown, and was so continually exercising him-
self, even in the most trivial matters, that when his
thoughts were once started in a line of speculation
of this kind he could only turn them aside with diffi-
culty. His quick eye saw at once that the carriage
did not belong to a professional man. It was, in
fact, a miniature brougham, and the daintiness of the
linings, the ornamentation on the harness, seemed
to indicate that a lady rather than a gentleman was
accustomed to use it. While he was standing
abstractedly gazing at the equipage some one knocked
against him. He looked up, and his eyes met those
of the stranger.</p>

<p><q>Bless my soul, is it you, Kraker?</q> said the
latter, somewhat in confusion.</p>

<p><q>Good morning, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lavey,</q> returned Matthew
Kraker, coldly.</p>

<p><q>What are you doing here, hay? On a holiday?</q>
said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lavey, with a certain fidgettiness of manner
not usual to him.</p>

<p><q>No; I've left Homburg for good. Nothing to do
with the board of green cloth now.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh I see—want to get into respectable society,
hay?</q> replied <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lavey, with a scarcely perceptible
sneer.</p>

<p><q>That's it, sir,</q> rejoined Kraker, steadily. <q>And
I should advise you to do the same. You hadn't
many acquaintances in that rank, I fancy, when I
knew you at Homburg.</q></p>

<p><q>Doose take it, Kraker! you're mighty imperti-
nent. But we were always good friends, weren't
we?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh! as far as I'm concerned I've nothing to say:
You'd have cheated me as you've cheated a hundred
others if you could have done it safely.</q></p>

<p><q>'Pon my soul, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker! you're too bad. I say,
that's a neat turnout isn't it?</q> said the money-
lender, hurriedly, and as if desirous of changing the
subject.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> replied <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, in an apparently care-
less tone. <q>Looks like a lady's carriage. An old
maid's perhaps. This is just the square for an old
maid, dull and respectable. Maybe she's going to
Exeter Hall.</q></p>

<p>At this Lavey burst out into a loud guffaw.</p>

<p><q>That's too good! Exeter Hall, ha, ha! Not
much of the old maid about the gay young party who
rides in that gorgeous little box.</q></p>

<p><q>Indeed!</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, and if I'm not much mistaken I know who
the lady is. The fellow who lives in that house is
awfully spooney on her, and if he don't look out she'll
soon send him to the dogs. But I must be off. Ta,
ta, Kraker; glad to see you well.</q></p>

<p>And <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lavey hurried off with much more alacrity
than anyone knowing his real age would have believed
him capable of. The fact was, the meeting with
Kraker was for him slightly embarrassing, as a few
years since he had to fly from Homburg under very
questionable circumstances; so much so that had he
returned the police would at once have made his
acquaintance. As a gentleman of the Captain Deu-
ceace tribe, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lavey had on the continent made a
considerable sum of money; but, dazzled by success,
he had been led into imprudencies which a more
cautious man would have avoided, and thus had
suddenly found it desirable to take up his residence
permanently in London, where it cannot be said he
had not prospered.</p>

<p><q>The old blackleg!</q> muttered Kraker, as he
watched the figure of the moneylender disappear in
the gloom. <q>He hates me like poison, but he little
thinks he had just done me a good turn. Gerald is in
love, is he? That is news, indeed.</q></p>

<p>At that moment the door opened, and a lady of
middle height, dressed in the top of fashion, but with
exquisite taste, tripped gracefully down the steps,
and stepped into the carriage. Kraker just caught a
glimpse of her face, but enough to tell him that she
was surpassingly beautiful. There was nothing in all
this, but, nevertheless, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker shook his head
solemnly, and his face wore a grave look not often
seen there. The coachman slammed the door, climbed
the box, gathered up the reins, and started the horses
at a gallop. Scarcely had they got a dozen yards
away before <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker uttered something remark-
ably like an oath, and set off running as fast as his
little legs could carry him.</p>

<p><q>Fool that I am! If I could but once see this
little lady she will tell me all,</q> was the thought
which had so suddenly communicated its effect to his
legs. The carriage had entered Museum Street, and
thither Matthew Kraker pursued it, in the hope of
keeping it in sight until he got a cab. Unluckily
there was not one on the rank, and away darted the
little man panting and snorting towards Oxford
Street. There was a hansom crawling towards the
city, and this he hailed.</p>

<p><q>Do you see that carriage?</q> he gasped.</p>

<p><q>Wot, that 'un with a pair of 'osses?</q> said the
man, looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p><q>Yes, yes, keep it in sight, and go wherever it
goes, and I'll double your fare.</q></p>

<p><q>Right you are, sir. Jump in, and on we goes.</q></p>

<p>The horse, fortunately, was a good one, and by
dint of applying the whip liberally the hansom soon
began to overtake the carriage. The latter proceeded
up Oxford Street as far as the Edgeware Road. Once
or twice the carriage nearly escaped them; but the
<q>cabby</q> was a sharp fellow, and contrived, on the
whole, to keep it well in sight. Near Oxford Circus
the carriage stopped for half-an-hour at a jeweller's
shop, and for an hour at the large drapery at the
corner, but at last Devonshire Road, Regent's Park,
was reached. When <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker saw the carriage
pull up he called to the cabman that he would now
get out. He did so, paid the man liberally, and dis-
missed him.</p>

<p>The amateur detective slowly sauntered up to the
house the lady had entered, and arrived there just as
the coachman was driving away.</p>

<p><q>Here, my man, who is it lives here? You're not
above half-a-crown, are you?</q></p>

<p>The man looked at him curiously, his face broke
into a grin, and he held out his hand.</p>

<p><q>If you wants to know werry partikler, it's
Davenport. <emph>Missis</emph>, mind you, not <emph>Miss;</emph></q> and pocket-
ing the half-crown, the fellow grinned again, and
whipping up his horses, drove off.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker said nothing, but, graver than ever,
went up to the door, and knocked loudly.</p>

<p><q>I want to see <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Davenport,</q> said he.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him hesitatingly.</p>

<p><q>She's not at home,</q> she was beginning, when
Kraker interrupted her.</p>

<p><q>Don't tell me any lies, girl, because I saw her
go in just now. Have the kindness to inform her
that a friend of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gerald Delanne wishes to see
her on very important business.</q></p>

<p><q>I beg your pardon, sir,</q> returned the girl in some
confusion. <q>I didn't know, I'm sure;</q> and, leading
the way, she showed the detective into the gorgeous
room which has before been described, and whose
sumptuous elegance nearly took Kraker's breath
away.</p>

<p><q>Phew. This is where the money went, is it?</q>
was his reflection. <q>Lavey, I fear, was not far wrong.
Gerald is, indeed, in a fair way of going to the
dogs.</q></p>

<p>His soliloquy was interrupted by the door opening
and the entrance of Mademoiselle Lucie. She was
dressed in a loose robe of black satin embroidered
with gold, her dark hair was carelessly tied with a
crimson riband, and fell like a cascade upon her neck,
and was just thrown back sufficiently to reveal her
delicately shaped ears. She certainly looked very
beautiful, and so much so that Kraker was almost
startled. However, he did not wonder that Gerald
should be fascinated.</p>

<p><q>You wished to see me?</q> she began in her slightly
foreign accent.</p>

<p><q>Yes, I am, I may say, the nearest friend of <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Delanne.</q></p>

<p><q>Will you not be seated?</q> interrupted the young
lady, with vivacity.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker sat down on a chair of ebony and gold,
and Mademoiselle Lucie disposed herself gracefully
on the crimson satin settee.</p>

<p><q>I have come on rather an important matter.
You were at <corr>Russell</corr> Square this morning?</q></p>

<p>The lady burst into a ringing laugh.</p>

<p><q>What, does he know already of my visit? He
certainly has lost no time in sending me word.</q></p>

<p><q>My dear Madam,</q> began Kraker.</p>

<p><q>Now, I know exactly what you have come for.
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Delanne has sent you to scold me. I'm sure of
it. That comes of falling in love with an enigma.
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Delanne has always forbidden me to go to his
home. Why I never could see, and because I have
disobeyed him to-day he has gone into a passion.
Come, now, am I not right?</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker listened attentively. He was like one
who had lost his way in a wood full of traps and pit-
falls. He carefully waited until he should put his
foot on safe ground.</p>

<p><q>It was very imprudent,</q> he ventured to say.</p>

<p><q>I don't see it,</q> pouted the girl. <q>As it was, no
harm was done. He was out, and no one knew who
<emph>I</emph> was. How should <emph>I</emph> know his mother was lying
dead. He keeps everything secret, and I know
nothing of his affairs, though no one has a better
right.</q></p>

<p>The detective had found a firm place.</p><!-- deleted "a" -->

<p><q>Yes,</q> said he, <q>my friend Gerald was out
when you came, and that is why he has sent me, his
confidential friend, immediately to know why you
came to his house in defiance of his express wish.</q></p>

<p>The girl's eyes flashed with suppressed passion.</p>

<p><q>I came,</q> said she, in an angry tone, <q>because
I was told that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gerald Delanne was about to be
married. What woman would not have done the
same?</q></p>

<p><q>I think you must be mistaken,</q> hazarded
Kraker. <q>I am, as I have told you, intimately
acquainted with Delanne, and I should be certain to
have heard of it.</q></p>

<p><q>Then why does he treat me so sharply? and why
has he altered so within the last month? Why is he
always in a bad temper?</q></p>

<p>During his journey in the cab <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker had
made up his mind as to the information he wished to
gain. If he could only discover how Gerald had
spent the evening of the 25th of May the question
would be at once settled. The ex-croupier knew a
little of the nature of women, and he was pretty
certain that in the temper in which Mademoiselle
Lucie now was that she would, if encouraged, talk
as long as he liked to listen.</p>

<p><q>But, of course, you do not care much for him?</q>
said he quietly.</p>

<p><q>I have always loved him,</q> she said passionately,
<q>but he does not treat me rightly. I am fond of
pleasure, of company, and he prisons me here like a
bird in a cage. Why should he keep me from his
friends? You are the only one I have ever seen.</q></p>

<p>Kraker could have enlightened her as to the
reason, but he merely replied that this perhaps was
because he was inclined to be jealous.</p>

<p>The lady laughed sarcastically.</p>

<p><q>Perhaps you will say that he makes up for this
neglect by spending his money on me. That is not
my affair; if he ruins himself, why he must—that's
all. I should very much prefer less money and more
regard for my feelings. If <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Delanne treats me
as a child, I act as a child, so he can't complain.</q></p>

<p><q>But does he not go out with you?</q></p>

<p><q>Sometimes. A fortnight ago this very day
(Kraker started, it was the 25th of May she men-
tioned) we went together to the theatre. We had a
box, but what did he do? positively left me the
entire evening until nearly eleven o'clock.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, I think I can account for his absence. Are
you sure it was on Tuesday, the 25th of May?</q>
asked Kraker, with ill-concealed anxiety.</p>

<p><q>Certainly, for a good reason. It was my birth-
day, and that made his conduct all the worse.</q></p>

<p><q>I remember,</q> replied Kraker, <q>that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Delanne
had some very important business that evening.</q></p>

<p>It is needless to say that the detective had only
just discovered this fact.</p>

<p><q>Then,</q> returned Mademoiselle, <q>it was a busi-
ness that required a few glasses of brandy, for <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Delanne had had decidedly too much, and we very
nearly had a violent quarrel.</q></p>

<p>At these words the detective could scarcely main-
tain his self-possession. Every step he took seemed
to confirm his worst suspicions.</p>

<p><q>Not that I object to him drinking brandy,</q>
resumed Lucie, <q>for without it he is certainly one
of the dullest of companions; at least, he has been
so for the last few weeks.</q></p>

<p>Kraker could bear to hear no more, and he started
to his feet excitedly.</p>

<p><q>By God,</q> he cried, <q>it is he, Madame—good
evening.</q></p>

<p>And the next moment he had run out of the room,
and Lucie heard the street door shut violently.</p>

<p>She was so taken by surprise that for a minute she
seemed paralysed. When she recovered she ran to
the bell, and rang it violently.</p>

<p><q>Jane,</q> she cried in agitation, <q>what name did
that man give?</q></p>

<p>Jane couldn't recollect. She did not think he gave
any name.</p>

<p><q>No, nor did he tell me. I don't believe he is a
friend of Gerald's at all. He has come here to worm
something out of me.</q></p>

<p>A vague indefinite terror seized her. She knew
not why, but Kraker's visit seemed to bode no good
to Gerald. What had he done? No doubt he was
in difficulties over money matters. At all events she
would warn him.</p>

<p>She sat down and wrote a few lines, telling Gerald
of the strange visitor she had had, and describing
Kraker to the best of her ability.</p>

<p><q>Post it at once, Jane,</q> said she, <q>and he will
get it this evening.</q></p>

<p>Meanwhile Kraker, in a state of excitement to
which he was quite unaccustomed, hurried to Scot-
land Yard. Superintendent Parkinson was not
within.</p>

<p><q>Was anything ever so unlucky,</q> muttered the
little man, as he walked up and down. <q>Should
that girl warn him—but no, she cannot suspect any-
thing. She does not know me, and cannot have the
faintest suspicion of the man's guilt.</q></p>

<p>The Superintendent was expected to return every
minute, and Kraker determined upon waiting for
him. While so doing it occurred to him that he had
never carried out his intention of examining the
paletot which he had noticed had been found in a
cab on the evening of the 25th, and to utilise his
time he went to the office for the reception of such
property, and told the officer in charge what he
wanted.</p>

<!-- end of episode printed 1882-02-18 -->



<!-- episode printed 1882-02-25 -->

<p>The man looked along the shelves, and at last
found the articles. <q>Umbrella and paletot found in
cab 642, May 25th. Fare got in at Turnham Green;
was put down at Charing Cross.</q></p>

<p><q>That's it,</q> said Kraker.</p>

<p>Eagerly he undid the coat, and felt in the pockets.
In one was a pair of grey kid gloves, torn, and with
the surface on the inside of the fingers scraped off;
in another a pass for the stalls at the Lyceum.</p>

<p>Lucie's story was completely confirmed.</p>

<p><q>The evidence is overwhelming. Yes, 'tis he,</q>
murmured the detective. <q>The fool! to leave these
in a cab. They have hanged him. He could not be
more completely convicted even if I found the broken
foil, which, by the way, he must have stolen from the
Viscount's room the day he called at Chester-square.
For once villainy has tracked itself.</q></p>

<p>Telling the man he wanted the articles for evidence
in a most important murder case, he hurried back
with them to the room of Superintendent Parkinson,
who he found had returned.</p>

<p><q>I have just come from the Earl of Annesley,</q>
were the first words of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson. <q>Good
heaven, Kraker, what is the matter?</q> For the little
man's pale face and staring eyes at once attracted his
attention.</p>

<p><q>Nothing; that is, I have put my hand on the right
man. There is no mistake this time. Look here,</q>
and he showed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson the umbrella, the pale-
tot, and the gloves. He related briefly how they had
been found, and how, coupled with what he had
learned at Devonshire-road, they pointed to Gerald
Delanne as the man who alone had committed the
murder.</p>

<p><q>Not a second is to be lost,</q> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, in
conclusion. <q>If the girl warns him he will immedia-
tely make himself scarce.</q></p>

<p><q>But you did not tell <emph>her</emph> anything?</q> said the
Superintendent.</p>

<p><q>Of course not,</q> replied <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kraker, with some-
thing like scorn. <q>But women are <q>kittle cattle,</q>
and especially women in love. If she does not scent
danger to her love in my visit, and especially my
hurried departure, in which I am willing to admit I
made a slight mistake, why, write me down <q>ass,</q>
that's all.</q></p>

<p><q>This is no common man we have to deal with,
that's plain, and I think you are right in advising his
instant capture.</q> And the Superintendent, sounding
his bell, gave orders for two men, whom he named, to
be in readiness.</p>

<p><q>I shall send at once to Russell-square,</q> said he.</p>

<p><q>And why not to the Earl's? I understood that
some sort of recognition by the Earl has taken place,
and that Delanne was about to reside with his
father.</q></p>

<p><q>I have put a stop to that,</q> returned the Superin-
tendent, grimly. <q>I came to the conclusion that this
Delanne was the murderer, and I made it my duty to
visit the Earl this morning, and I have acquainted
him with Rennett's story. He thoroughly believes
in its truth; indeed, after I showed him the document
he hadn't the slightest doubt, for he recognised two,
at least, of the signatures. I shan't likely forget the
interview though,</q> added the Superintendent, draw-
ing a long breath. <q>The Earl's as proud as Lucifer,
and the intelligence was like a thunderbolt. It com-
pletely prostrated him. If the fellow goes there he'll
have a warm reception, I'll swear.</q></p>

<p>Kraker heard these words in silence. After a while
he said—</p>

<p><q>Very well, send to Russell Square, and if you'll
take my advice, you won't overlook Devonshire-road,
Regent's Park.</q></p>

</div>



<div n="24" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XXIV.</head>
<head type="main">Brought to Bay.</head>

<p>As the Superintendent had truly said, the effect of
his intelligence upon the Earl was simply paralysing.
In an hour the proud old man had become in appear-
ance years older; his step, once firm and elastic, was
hesitating and heavy, the brightness of his eye had
dimmed, his head was bowed, and lines about his
mouth and eyes were deeply graven, never to be
effaced.</p>

<p>He had that morning risen with the intention of
making preparations for the reception of the man
who, he thought, was his lawful son. He had gone
with that purpose to the apartments of Viscount
Morleigh—the first time, indeed, he had visited them
since the arrest of the young man. Here it was, in
that room which has been before described as like an
armoury, he received the paralysing news brought by
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parkinson, and here he remained, after the
departure of the official, motionless and silent, as if
stunned by the blow.</p>

<p>Five minutes had passed, during which he sat with
his head bent on his chest, and his eyes fixed on the
floor. A slight tapping at the door failed to arouse
him, and the visitor at length turned the handle and
walked into the room.</p>

<p>It was Gerald Delanne.</p>

<p>The young man advanced within three feet of the
Earl before the latter looked up. When he did so a
change instantaneously spread itself over his features,
and springing to his feet, his form as erect as ever,
his eye flushing with its old fire, he cried in a loud
voice—</p>

<p><q>Scoundrel.</q></p>

<p>Gerald involuntarily recoiled, but directly after-
wards recovered his self-possession.</p>

<p><q>My lord!</q> he exclaimed in a surprised tone.</p>

<p><q>Scoundrel, I repeat. By heaven, come not a step
further lest I be tempted to do you harm.</q></p>

<p>There was a dead silence, during which the two men
looked at each other with an intensity of expression
which can only be imagined, not described.</p>

<p>Gerald was the first to break the spell.</p>

<p><q>You speak in riddles, my lord,</q> said he in a cool
voice. <q>Either you are mad or the victim of a gross
deception.</q></p>

<p>The Earl drew back a step, and darted a look of
furious passion at the young man.</p>

<p><q>Liar, murderer,</q> he hissed, <q>I am neither mad
not have I been deceived, except by you. Have the
kindness to read that document,</q> and he held out
the paper left with him at his request by the Superin-
tendent.</p>

<p><q>I have no desire to waste time over such a childish
concoction,</q> returned Gerald, contemptuously. <q>I
am only surprised that a man of your lordship's per-
ception should be taken in by——</q></p>

<p><q>Silence,</q> interrupted the Earl sternly. <q>Within
this hour I have been made acquainted with facts
which show you to be as black-hearted a villain as
ever trod the earth.</q></p>

<p><q>I am the son of your lordship,</q> he returned, a
mocking smile wreathing his thin lips, which, by the
way, during the last two minutes had become per-
fectly bloodless.</p>

<p><q>Unhappily, yes,</q> rejoined the Earl quickly. <q>It
did not need your insolence to remind me of it.
Listen. To secure your brother's birthright you con-
cocted this devilish scheme. You first murdered this
miserable woman, you trusted with diabolical in-
genuity to fix the guilt on an innocent man, you were
the cause of your own mother's death, and you would
have foisted yourself, an imposter and an assassin,
upon me.</q></p>

<p>Delanne's face during the Earl's recital underwent
a marvellous change, the muscles quivered, the com-
plexion turned livid, and the perspiration stood like
beads upon his forehead. With an extraordinary
effort, however, he preserved his calmness of tone,
and he answered without a tremor in his voice—</p>

<p><q>And what then, my lord?</q></p>

<p><q>That within an hour you will be arrested, and
placed in the felon's prison you so richly deserve.</q></p>

<p>Delanne started violently, and clenching his fist he
advanced a step.</p>

<p><q>Then, my lord,</q> he said, his eyes glistening as he
spoke, <q>I shall have to thank you—my father—for
my death. It will be a pretty piece of scandal—the
son of the proud Earl of Annesley, whose escutcheon
has not a stain upon it, to be hanged by the common
hangman.</q></p>

<p>The Earl was pierced in the weakest part of his
armour—his pride. For a moment he shielded his
eyes, as if ashamed to show his weakness before
Delanne. Then removing his hand, he said sternly—</p>

<p><q>For a man of honour there is no way to wash out
so deep a stain but by his own blood. Bravery alone
can atone for the crime of which you have been
guilty,</q> and he pointed to a side table on which stood
an open case containing a pair of pistols.</p>

<p><q>I understand you,</q> returned Delanne signifi-
cantly, <q>and I may tell you at once that I have no
intention of making such a fool of myself. My lord,
it is useless beating about the bush any longer. I am
a desperate man, and with the bloodhounds of the
law at my heels I have no time to waste in recrimin-
ations. Let us understand each other. I have done
all that you say. It was a bold stroke, but it has
failed. Be it so. The question is, what is the result
of the failure? My brother, of course, will be released,
but you will gain nothing but dishonour by my death.
Give me sufficient money, and in half-an-hour I dis-
appear, never again to trouble you.</q></p>

<p>He spoke with a concentrated energy which had its
effect upon the Earl. But between his pride and his
abhorrence of the cool villainy of Delanne there was
a violent struggle, and the old nobleman naturally
hesitated.</p>

<p><q>How much will content you?</q> he asked at last,
in a feeble tone.</p>

<p><q>Not less than &#xa3;5,000.</q></p>

<p>The largeness of the amount staggered the Earl.</p>

<p><q>I see you hesitate,</q> said Delanne, with a sar-
donic smile. <q>'Tis but a third of one year's
income—a liberal sum truly to save one's son from
the hangman.</q></p>

<p>The word seemed to inspire the Earl with horror.</p>

<p><q>Say no more,</q> he returned in a hoarse voice.
<q>You shall have the money.</q></p>

<p>He sat down to the table, took out his cheque
book, and wrote a cheque.</p>

<p><q>Here,</q> said he, with his face averted (he could
not bear to look upon the miserable man), <q>is a
cheque for &#xa3;1,000; the rest shall be made payable
at any place you choose to name on the Continent.</q></p>

<p><q>That will do,</q> returned Delanne, coolly folding
up the cheque. <q>Say Paris.</q></p>

<p>The Earl wrote a few words on a piece of paper,
and handed it to Delanne.</p>

<p><q>Present that at the agents of my bankers within
a week, and the money will be paid.</q></p>

<p>Delanne's face wore a triumphant expression as he
placed the cheque and the order within his pocket
book.</p>

<p><q>I can now defy the police,</q> he muttered with
exultation. <q>Adieu, my lord,</q> he added sarcasti-
cally. <q>I have to thank you for my birth; it is
only due to this,</q> and he tapped the pocket book,
<q>that I have not to thank you also for my death,</q>
and with an elaborate bow he quitted the room.</p>

<p>As he shut the door he heard the sound within as
of a heavy fall, but his swift step never paused, and
he hurried down the staircase, and the next moment
was in the street.</p>

<p>The fresh air and the reaction had a curious effect
upon him, and on getting outside he reeled for a
moment or two like a drunken man.</p>

<p><q>Bah,</q> he muttered, <q>I am a fool.</q></p>

<p>He put his hand to his head and tried to think.</p>

<p><q>Yes, the cheque. I must get it changed at once.
That is the first thing.</q></p>

<p>He hailed a passing cab, managed to crawl in
somehow, cursing the driver meanwhile for having
so high a step, and told him to drive at the top of
his speed to Pall Mall, where were the offices of the
Earl's bankers.</p>

<p>The ride seemed to steady his nerves, and when he
alighted he walked into the bank with tolerable
steadiness. The money was paid without demur,
and, with a thousand pounds in gold and notes, he
once more stepped into the road.</p>

<p>Had any of his friends met him just now they
would hardly have recognised him. It was as if a
mask had dropped from his face. The ascetic look,
the expression of cold superiority, had gone, leaving
only blank despair and utter helplessness. The
fever of the last fortnight which had sustained him
had fled, and the sense of guilt and of complete
failure was too much even for his stony heart. With
his eyes glaring wildly, and as one in a dream, he
walked towards Charing Cross, unconscious whither
he was going, and it was only when he came in front
of a public-house that he at all recovered himself.</p>

<p>He went in, and called for sixpennyworth of
brandy, which he drank without any water, much to
the astonishment of the barmaid, and throwing down
the money boisterously, passed again into the street.
The brandy to some extent strengthened him, but he
still retained his trance-like state. He saw every-
thing through the medium of his own distorted
imagination. He shook with terror as a stolid-faced
policemen passed him; he fancied every person he
met glared meaningly at him; a harmless boy who
asked him the time ran off with affright at the
torrent of oaths he poured out; every moment he
expected a hand to be laid upon his shoulder for his
arrest.</p>

<p>And then the frenzy passed. He stopped, mut-
tered something incoherently, and slowly the light
of reason dawned in his eye.</p>

<p><q>Let me think,</q> he murmured; <q>let me think.</q></p>

<p>His mind was like to a man groping in the dark.
Full of apprehension, nay, of terror, it was yet of a
vague, of a nameless kind, and he could not summon
the smallest idea to assist him to find the clue to that
which haunted him.</p>

<p>A ghastly smile passed over his face.</p>

<p><q>Ah, I have it now. I must disguise myself.</q></p>

<p>This thought having possessed him, he searched
the shops to find among them a hairdresser's; but,
with a strange contradiction, when he found one he
dared not enter.</p>

<p><q>No, no; they will be sure to think I should put
on a false beard. I am better as I am.</q></p>

<p>He retraced his steps towards Charing Cross, and
at last mustered up sufficient courage to enter a
tailor's. He bought here a greatcoat and a travelling
cap, and directed his hat to be packed and sent to an
out-of-the-way country station on the Great Nor-
thern line, <q>to be left till called for;</q> and then,
arrayed in his purchase, he sallied forth, feeling a
little more secure now that he had changed his
costume.</p>

<p>But he was still uncertain where to go, what to
do. He bought a Bradshaw, and looked out the time
when the night mail would start. The figures had a
strange fascination for him, and he found himself
looking out the times of starting for all kinds of
places, to none of which, of course, he had the least
intention of going.</p>

<p>So the afternoon passed. As the evening ap-
proached he grew calmer, for the darkness seemed to
him in some sort to be a security. At intervals
during the day, in the midst of his most horrible
thoughts, and even when his terrors most impressed
him, he had seen one face, syren-like, smiling at
him, and, as it were, drawing him on with her glance.
While it was light, and while he had a kind of com-
panionship in the moving throng, he had resisted the
impulse which would have led him to her who had
been his ruin, but now that the day was fading he
felt an intense abhorrence of his own presence. He
could not pass the long hours of the night alone,
and, heedless that he had resolved to go by the
night mail to Paris, he determined to set out to
Devonshire Road at all hazards, and, if possible,
prevail upon Lucie to fly with him.</p>

<p><q>She likes Paris better than London,</q> he thought.
<q>She will go with me, I am certain. What matter
if she does not love me? I love her. I cannot live
without her.</q></p>

<p>But in the midst of his passion came the reflection
that to travel with a woman, and with a woman
young and handsome, added greatly to the risk of
capture.</p>

<p><q>What does it matter? If I am taken I have one
card left to play,</q> and he smiled grimly. <q>I already
risk too much to be particular about risking any more.
Was it not for her that I made myself mad? Was
it not for her that I——</q></p>

<p>But he could not finish the sentence, for the horrors
of that night at Ivy Cottage were too much for his
excited brain.</p>

<p>Yes, a vicious passion which had overpowered his
better self, which had absorbed all his thoughts, all
his being, had been his ruin. To gratify a frivolous
and selfish woman he had plunged himself overhead
and ears in debt. Reckless, and not knowing which
way to turn, chance had thrown in his way the
correspondence which seemed to show he was the
legitimate son of the Earl of Annesley. He believed
that this really was the case, but his mother had un-
deceived him, and, in addition to her own statement,
had produced several letters from Matilda Rennett
which confirmed her words beyond a doubt. At first
he had tried to persuade his mother to maintain the
deception, and to assist him in asserting his rights,
but she absolutely refused, and then it was he con-
ceived the diabolical scheme of murdering Matilda
Rennett, confident that his mother, even if she sus-
pected, would never betray him. Previous to carry-
ing out his plot he had burnt several letters from the
Earl to his mother, written after, and preserved
those which were written previous to the supposed
substitution, so that in the event of the matter being
inquired into it should throw more suspicion upon
the Viscount. That it would have been so is evident,
since the substitution being in doubt, it would
naturally be inferred that this doubt had instigated
the Viscount to take advantage of it. The train
thus laid, he hesitated not to apply the torch. All
succeeded according to his calculations, and, indeed,
beyond his wildest hopes, since he could never have
contemplated the illness and death of his mother, the
most important actor in the affair. But while she
lay unconscious he was full of uneasiness, lest by a
word in delirium she might betray him, and for this
reason he took Kraker into his confidence. He was
aware, though Kraker did not know that he knew,
of the little man's connection with the police, and he
effectually led him on a false scent.</p>

<p>All the scenes in the frightful tragedy, all his
hopes, fears, and struggles presented themselves in
all their vividness as he sat within the cab which
conveyed him to Devonshire Road. It would have
seemed to him like a hideous nightmare did not every
now and then come the sickening consciousness that
all was true to the very letter.</p>

<p>When the cab stopped at the house he jumped
quickly out, told the man to wait, and bounded up
the steps and knocked loudly.</p>

<p>The door was opened almost immediately.</p>

<p><q>Oh, sir!</q> exclaimed the servant, when she saw
who it was, <q>I'm so glad you have come. Mistress
has been so anxious about you.</q></p>

<p>Anxious about him! Why should she be anxi-
ous? Had anything happened? At the suspicion
of a real danger his natural wit immediately asserted
itself.</p>

<p><q>Jane,</q> said he, <q>give the cabman this shilling,
and tell him he need not wait. And, mind you, if
anyone knocks do not open the door.</q></p>

<p>He had noticed that the shutters of the house were
closed, and not a gleam of light could be seen any-
where.</p>

<p>As he entered the room Lucie ran to him, and was
about to put her arms around his neck when she
suddenly stopped and uttered a loud cry of fear.</p>

<p><q>Good heavens, Gerald!</q> she exclaimed, <q>what
is the matter with you?</q></p>

<p>For his face had so changed that in its haggard-
ness, its bloodshot eyes, and blackened and cracked
lips, she could scarcely recognise her lover.</p>

<p>Delanne did not reply, but he took both her hands,
and looked her in the face.</p>

<p><q>Lucie,</q> he said, in a voice of intense passion,
<q>do you love me?</q></p>

<p><q>What a curious question! You quite frighten
me—you look so strange. Isn't it some trick, now?
I do believe I shall really have to be angry with you.</q></p>

<p><q>Chut!</q> he exclaimed, fiercely, <q>this is no time
for fooling. I repeat—Do you love me? Yes or
no?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, yes, of course I love you,</q> replied the
girl, alarmed at his vehemence. <q>Let go my hand
please, you are hurting me.</q></p>

<p>He never heeded her appeal, but went on—</p>

<p><q>If you love me, then you will come with me.</q></p>

<p><q>Come with you!</q> she returned, growing still
more frightened.</p>

<p><q>Yes; quick—this instant. Every second we
wait but increases the danger.</q></p>

<p><q>The danger!</q> said she, drawing her hands
away, and recoiling from him.</p>

<p><q>Aye, you may not know it—a woman rarely
does until too late—but I have loved you too much.
Time, prospects, money, all have gone for you.
Somewhat involved in difficulties, and seeing no way
to turn, put me under strong temptations. I—but
no matter what I did; I swear it was for your sake.</q></p>

<p>The girl looked at him for a moment, and read in
his haggard looks and bleared eyes that he spoke the
truth. Perhaps there was something in this that
appealed strongly to her vanity, or it may be that
her better nature, now that the man who loved her
was in trouble, peeped out. She did not know what
crime he had committed; she did not know the
danger that pursued him; and she came up softly,
placed her arm around his neck, and whispered—</p>

<p><q>I will go with you, Gerald.</q></p>

<p>A ghastly smile for a moment illumined the young
man's features, but it slowly lifted, and left them
livid as before.</p>

<p><q>Go,</q> he whispered hoarsely. <q>Pack a few
things together, and we will be off. I give you
five minutes.</q></p>

<p>Lucie hastened out of the room, and flew up the
stairs. He walked up and down with the watch in
his hand, his eye fixed on the second hand, his ear on
the alert. Three minutes, four minutes passed, and
Lucie was still in her room.</p>

<p>He muttered an oath, and went impatiently into
the passage.</p>

<p><q>Are you ready?</q> he called out.</p>

<p><q>In one minute,</q> was the answer.</p>

<p>More restless pacing to and fro, more anxious
glances at the watch. Two minutes more, and yet
she had not appeared.</p>

<p><q>I can wait no longer,</q> he shouted.</p>

<p>He was about to run up the stairs when she ap-
peared at the top, her face flushed with the haste
she had made.</p>

<p>Just as she reached him she uttered a cry—</p>

<p><q>My jewels,</q> she exclaimed; <q>I cannot go with-
out them;</q> and before he could prevent her she had
run up stairs once more.</p>

<p>He was about to pursue her when a loud knock at
the street door sounded through the house. His
frame seemed, as it were, to turn to stone, and for a
time he was incapable of motion.</p>

<p>The servant came running from the lower passage.</p>

<p><q>Oh sir,</q> she cried, <q>there are three men out-
side the door! Shall I let them in?</q></p>

<p>Her words brought back the life into his paralysed
brain.</p>

<p><q>No, let them break the door in first!</q> he hissed.
He glared wildly round, and ran to the staircase
window which looked out into the garden. He had
scarcely given one glance ere he uttered a cry of
despair. By the dim twilight he could see two or
three dark forms moving stealthily about. The
house was surrounded!</p>

<p>He turned like an animal at bay.</p>

<p><q>Jane!</q> he exclaimed fiercely, <q>tell your mistress
not to hurry. There is but one way,</q> he muttered 
to himself.</p>

<p>He ran quickly into the room and closed the door.
The frightened girl ran upstairs, gasping for breath,
and told her mistress what had happened, the knock-
ing at the street door meanwhile becoming louder
and more persistent.</p>

<p>Whatever vices Mademoiselle Lucie had she was
no coward.</p>

<p><q>It is the police,</q> she thought. <q>They have
come after him. Where is <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Delanne?</q> she
asked, rapidly.</p>

<p><q>In the drawing room,</q> returned Jane, with
chattering teeth.</p>

<p>Lucie instantly ran down the stairs and opened
the door. She did not at first see him, owing to the
gloom. The next moment she bounded across the
floor as if impelled by some supernatural power to-
wards the fire-place, where he was standing, his
right arm uplifted and his hand towards his chest.</p>

<p>It was too late. A loud report shook the house
from its foundations to its rafters, and Gerald De-
lanne fell to the ground shot by his own hand.</p>

<p>With a piercing shriek the girl flung herself by
his side, and almost at the same moment two police-
men, accompanied by Matthew Kraker, entered the
room.</p>

<p>At first they thought the girl was shot, but she
soon undeceived them by entreating them to send
for a doctor. Despatching one of the men for this
purpose, Kraker knelt down and looked at the corpse-
like features of him who had once been his friend.
The blood was oozing from a deep wound in his
chest, but he was yet alive, although the eyes were
glassy, and the damp moisture of death was on his
brow. Presently the pallid lips moved.</p>

<p><q>Kraker,</q> he gasped, <q>it is all over. It was—
I who murdered—Matilda Rennett. Forgive—oh,
God!</q></p>

<p>And with this confession of his guilt trembling
upon his dying breath, the spirit of the wretched
man fled.</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>Is there need to say much more? I fancy not.
The release of Viscount Morleigh and his marriage
with Florence are but foregone conclusions, and it is
of not much consequence to tell how Lady Dorring-
ton suffered herself to be gradually persuaded into
accepting the young nobleman as her son-in-law.
The Earl never recovered from the shock which the
events of that terrible month inflicted on him. After
that last interview with Delanne he was found lying
on the floor, his features distorted, and with one side
totally paralysed. He regained the use of his limbs
to a certain extent, but never his reason, and he did
not live long after the Viscount's marriage. Of
Mademoiselle Lucie there is no necessity to say any-
thing, as she is fully capable of taking care of
herself, while Matthew Kraker—well, he has had
many a difficult problem to solve, but none more so
than the startling secret he dragged from the dark.</p>
