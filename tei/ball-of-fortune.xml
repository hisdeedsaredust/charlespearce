<head type="main">Prologue</head>

<p>The scene is in California. From the
borders of a noble river rises a series
of eminences, in which, interspersed
among the trees, can be seen a number of tents,
with here and there a misshapen, yet pictur-
esque log-hut. It is early morning, and, though
the sun is shining brilliantly, it does not send
forth a scorching heat, as presently it will do,
when the gentle breeze which now and again
stirs the foliage dies away. Down by the river
are groups of men, some standing bare-legged
in the stream, working with broad shovels, and
others busily sifting and washing the fine sand
which their comrades have just dug from the
river s bed. All this digging, sifting, and wash-
ing have but one object—the finding of gold,
and to this Californian gold-field have come men
from nearly every nation under the sun—English,
<pb n="10"/>
<fw>Captain Somerset.</fw>
French, Germans, Spaniards, Mexicans, and even
Chinese. </p>
<p>In front of one of the log-huts already men-
tioned are three men sitting, or rather lounging,
round a camp fire. Tea has just been made in
the kettle, slung, gipsy fashion, over the fire, and
this, with ship's biscuits, bought at the price of
rich plum-cake from the store at the river-side,
forms the breakfast.</p>
<p><said>And so you're off to-day, Cap'en, air you?</said>
said one of the group—a tall, lantern-jawed,
sallow-faced Yankee, with little twinkling eyes
and sandy hair.</p>
<p><said>Aye, aye, Lampard,</said> rejoined the man ad-
dressed, an Englishman every inch of him, with his
blue eye, and brown beard and moustache just
beginning to be streaked with gray. Captain
Samuel Somerset carried his fifty years well in
spite of his thirty years spent at sea, and storms
and hard knocks had not dimmed the brightness
of his eye, though they might have furrowed his
cheek.</p>
<p><said>Wa-al, now,</said> resumed the Yankee, <said>I suppose,
Cap'en, you've made a pretty tall pile. You've
been at these diggings two years or more, hain't
you?</said></p>
<p>The Captain looked up sharply, as much as to
say, <q>What is it to you how much gold I've
found?</q></p>
<p><said>Yes,</said> said he; <said>it's two years since I cleared
<pb n="11"/>
<fw>Ah Ling Foo.</fw>
out at San Francisco and came right away up
here. The crew went first, and then I followed.
I tell you what, Lampard, when I got that thirst
for the gold in me, I was bound to come, and no
one on earth could prevent me. But it's over
now. I've made my pile, and I'm back to old
England, and I'll warrant it'll be a long time
afore I'm afloat again.</said></p>
<p><said>Mean to settle down, eh, Cap'en?</said></p>
<p><said>Aye. I've got a youngster there, d'ye see, and
it's a matter o' some years since I set eyes on
him. He'll have grown a fine little chap by this
time.</said></p>
<p><said>Wa-al, it's a nice thing to be ashore for a spell,
but it don't suit me for long. I wish I'd had
<emph>your</emph> luck, Cap'en, at Swallow's Gully.</said></p>
<p><said>It isn't luck. A man who gambles away his
gold as fast as he gets it can't expect to make
much of a pile,</said> replied Captain Somerset shortly.</p>
<p><said>That's a fact; and if it hadn't been for that
Chinaman Ah Ling Foo I'd ha' sworn off cards long
ago. But the fit was on me, and I couldn't help
it.</said></p>
<p><said>Ah Ling Foo,</said> repeated the Captain musingly.
<said>What's become of that thieving rascal?</said></p>
<p><said>Broke. Cleaned out. Smashed. Guess he's
gone up to 'Frisco. Swallow's Gully's a long sight
too hot for him.</said></p>
<p><said>And a good thing too. A cunning scoundrel
like that fellow ought to be lynched.</said></p>
<pb n="12"/>
<fw>A Hut at the Diggings.</fw>
<p><said>I reckon he would have been if he'd stopped
here much longer. He was cute enough to make
tracks,</said> returned Lampard coolly.</p>
<p>Captain Somerset did not reply, but rose to his
feet and went into the log-hut, leaving the
Yankee lying on the ground and gazing con-
templatively at the fire.</p>
<p>We will follow the Captain into the hut.</p>
<p>There was little or no furniture inside. A
rough box did duty for a table, and another box
of a smaller size served for a chair. There was a
rough shelf along the whole of one side, on which
were arranged the Captain's household goods,
including the indispensable frying-pan, a couple
of tin pots, a washing-bowl, and a few tin plates.
All these, as well as the furniture, he had sold to
a neighbour who was only waiting until the
Captain should clear out to take possession of the
hut and its appurtenances.</p>
<p>Captain Somerset's preparations for departure
were soon made. The most important piece of
luggage—if luggage it could be called—was a
certain leather belt of great width. To this belt
was sewn a number of bags, making the belt no
light weight to carry, and no wonder, for the bags
were filled with gold dust.</p>
<p>The Captain fastened this belt on next his vest
and beneath his flannel shirt. A pair of cow-hide
boots reaching nearly to his knees, a broad-
brimmed hat and a Mexican blanket, which served
<pb n="13"/>
<fw>San Francisco.</fw>
equally well for a cloak in rainy weather and
for bedclothes at night, made his costume com-
plete.</p>
<p>He looked to the loading of his revolver, saw
that it was in perfect order, stuck his long-bladed
knife in its sheath, glanced round the hut as if
bidding it adieu, and stepped out once more into
the open.</p>
<p><said>Well, Lampard,</said> said he, <said>good-bye!</said></p>
<p><said>Look here, Cap'en,</said> was the American's reply;
<said>will you stay a day longer at the Gully, and I'll
tell you what I'll do,—I'll go with you to 'Frisco.</said></p>
<p><said>Thank ye; but I've made my plans, and
can't go from 'em. I've sold everything to Wal-
ters, and he wants to take possession,</said> returned
the Captain, evidently not overjoyed at the Yan-
kee's proposition.</p>
<p><said>Oh! if you don't want my company, I shan't
force it. I guess I'll be at 'Frisco as soon as you,</said>
said Lampard in a snarling tone.</p>
<p><said>Very like,</said> returned Captain Somerset briefly.</p>
<p>And without another word he walked to where
his horse was tethered, mounted it, and rode
slowly away from Swallow's Gully, its gold, and
its gold-diggers. Henceforth he had made up
his mind he would forswear a roving life and
live quietly at home in old England.</p>
<p>In three days more he was in San Francisco—
not so magnificent a city twenty years ago as it
is now, but still a thriving, bustling place, and
<pb n="14"/>
<fw><q>A Mixed Lot.</q></fw>
increasing as much in a month as other cities
increase in a year.</p>
<p>His first visit was to a ship-broker's office.</p>
<p><said>What, <emph>you</emph> here, Cap'en Somerset?</said> said the
shrewd broker, who recognized him directly he
entered. <said>Why, I heard you were dead—shot
by rowdies, they said.</said></p>
<p><said>Not I,</said> returned the sturdy Englishman. <said>I
should like to see the rowdy who would attempt
to shoot me.</said></p>
<p><said>Wa-al, sir, and have you been doing pretty
well up at the diggings?</said> asked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Patterson,
the broker.</p>
<p><said>Can't complain, sir. But I've had enough of
it, and want to get home.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Patterson cut a slice from a cake of tobacco
which he took from his waistcoat pocket, and
deposited it in his mouth before he spoke.</p>
<p><said>You wouldn't care to take one of our ships to
London, I s'pose, Cap'n, would you? We're
dreadful short of hands, and that's a fact. Every-
one who can get away is off to the gold-fields,</said>
said he at last.</p>
<p><said>I don't care,</said> answered Captain Somerset.
<said>I'd as lief take a command as not. Have you
got your crew?</said></p>
<p><said>Wa-al, yes,</said> said the broker slowly. <said>I might
say I had. Rather a mixed lot, p'raps, and you'll
have to keep a firm grip over 'em.</said></p>
<p>The Captain looked thoughtful before he replied.
<pb n="15"/>
<fw>Hosea Lampard.</fw>
Then he said, <said>I'll do that; trust me. What
about the officers?</said></p>
<p><said>Want a first mate; but I expect to find a man
to-day.</said></p>
<p>Then came the question of terms, which, after
some disputing, were finally settled, and Captain
Somerset agreed to take the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good Fortune</name> to
London. As had been the case with Captain
Somerset, the skipper of the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good Fortune</name> had,
as soon as she arrived at San Francisco, been
bitten with the gold fever, and had gone up the
country, and so the broker was very glad to get
hold of so experienced a commander as he knew
Samuel Somerset to be.</p>
<p>The following day the Captain went again to
the ship-broker's office and found <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Patterson
in a state of joyfulness.</p>
<p><said>All right, Cap'en. Got a first-rate fellow.
I guess you may know him. He was up at Swal-
low's Gully.</said></p>
<p><said>What's his name?</said></p>
<p><said>Lampard—Hosea Lampard.</said></p>
<p>Captain Somerset started. He frowned as if
the appointment did not please him, but he said
nothing.</p>
<p><said>I've got some of the crew outside,</said> went on the
broker. <said>P'r'aps you'd like to have a look at 'em.</said></p>
<p><said>Thank ye. I daresay I shall see them enough
and to spare when they're shipped,</said> returned the
captain with a laugh.</p>
<pb n="16"/>
<fw>The Cook.</fw>
<p><said>Well, there they are anyway.</said></p>
<p>Carelessly Captain Somerset strolled out of the
office and glanced up the street in the direction
indicated by the broker. There were six or
seven men standing outside a dramshop disputing
violently, no doubt to settle who was to pay for
the liquor they had drunk. As evil a set of men
as you would find anywhere, were the crew of
the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good Fortune</name>, and the captain shrugged his
shoulders and gave a low whistle directly he saw
them.</p>
<p><said>I don't think much of your choice, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Patter-
son,</said> said he.</p>
<p><said>I tell you what, Cap'en, if you knew how
scarce men were in these parts you'd think your-
self lucky to get even them, I reckon.</said></p>
<p><said>Should I? Seems to me you've been clearing
out your gaols. Hilloa! is that Chinaman one of
the lot?</said></p>
<p>This was in reference to a pig-tailed celestial
who had just joined the group.</p>
<p><said>Yes; and you'll find him tarnation handy.
You'll want a cook, won't you?</said></p>
<p><said>Do you know that this fellow—Ah Ling Foo,
as he calls himself—is one of the greatest rogues
in California, and that's saying a good deal? He
had to leave Swallow's Gully in a mighty hurry,
and the place is well rid of him.</said></p>
<p>The ship-broker heard Captain Somerset's
remark with perfect unconcern. He knew well
<pb n="17"/>
<fw>The <q>Good Fortune.</q></fw>
enough that if he were to reject a man on account
of his bad character, a ship's crew would not be
got together at all.</p>
<p>Captain Samuel Somerset left the broker's
office with a look of anxiety on his brow such as
it had not worn for many a long day. He did
not like the prospect of being shut up for three
months or so with a set of fellows whom he
thoroughly mistrusted. Still he had confidence in
the strength of his own right arm, and was not a
man to shrink from a task because it was dan-
gerous.</p>
<p>Before another week had passed the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good For-
tune</name> weighed anchor, spread out her canvas to
the breeze, and sailed across the magnificent bay
of San Francisco into the broad Pacific. Captain
Somerset had left California never to return.</p>
<p>Was it a presentiment of coming misfortune
which made him pace the deck so often in the
still hours of the night, and which led him to
look forward with fear rather than with hope to
his arrival in England?</p>
<p>Who can tell?</p>

<head type="main">Half-mast High</head>

<p><said>Poor Sam! well, we must all slip our
cable some day or another, I s'pose.
But it's hard just when he was a-look-
ing for'rard to settling down on shore as he should
be hurried up aloft. Howsumever, it's no use
worrying over what can't be mended; the best
thing as we can do is to look after them as he's
left and was a-working for.</said></p>
<p>And Jack Grigsby, river pilot, and as honest
and manly a soul as ever breathed, passed the
back of his freckled hand across his eyes, and
took a huge gulp of the stiff tumbler of rum and
water which the mate of the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good Fortune</name> had
mixed for him.</p>
<p>The <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good Fortune</name>, a stout barque of some 800
tons burthen, had that morning come into the
London Docks, her flag half-mast high—the
melancholy sign which denotes the presence of
death on board ship.</p>
<p><said>It's a rum thing, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lampard,</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
<pb n="19"/>
<fw>The Legacy.</fw>
Grigsby reflectively to the mate, <said>it's a rum thing
as I should have had a presentimerant of poor
Sam's death. I ain't a believer in amens</said>—Jack
Grigsby was by no means irreligious, so it is to
be presumed he meant <q>omens</q>—<said>but when I
broke my old meerschaum last Thursday as I've
had twenty years or more, I says to my Jennie,
If something don't happen within a week my
name ain't what it is, I says. And dreckly I
comes aboard the <name rend="i" type="vessel"><choice><reg>Fortun'</reg><orig>Fortun</orig></choice></name> at Gravesend and heerd
as Sam was near his last port, I says, <q>That's it.</q></said></p>
<p><said>Wa-al, sir,</said> said the mate in his American
twang, ejecting from his cheek a quid of long
service into the little stove which warmed the
captain's cabin, where this conversation was taking
place, <said>we did all <emph>we</emph> could, but Cap'en Somerset
was all'ays as hard as grit. I wanted him to go
ashore at Falmouth seeing as he was so queer;
but no, he said as he'd stick to his ship till the
last, which he did, and that's a fact, sir.</said></p>
<p><said>Ah!</said> rejoined <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, <said>a good fellow
was Sam, but cranky. Got a way of his own, as
I couldn't all'ays foller. That lump o' iron over
yonder's a case in p'int. What there is in a blessed
cannon-shot to be so mighty keerful of it, I can't
make out. Says he, a-gasping out his words,
and I shall never forget 'em, <said>Jack,</said> he says,
<said>that's for the boy. You'll see as he has it, won't
you?</said> And with that he clutches at my 'and,
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lampard, with fingers as were as cold as ice
<pb n="20"/>
<fw>Where is the Heir?</fw>
—I can a'most feel 'em now—and I swore to him
as I'd look arter it, and so I will, though it's only
a bit o' senseless iron as ain't good for nothing.</said></p>
<p>The object which had been committed to Jack
Grigsby's care, and at which he now pointed, was
a cannon-ball. There it lay, black, round, and
smooth, in a corner of the cabin; and however
useful, or dangerous, it was capable of proving
when devoted to its proper purpose and placed
inside a cannon, it certainly in its present condi-
tion bore out the pilot's words of being <q>good
for nothing.</q></p>
<p>The mate shrugged his shoulders in answer to
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, as much as to say that he thought
him a fool for his pains, and taking out his knife
and a cake of tobacco, began to cut a fresh
plug.</p>
<p><said>The youngster'll want a pair of stout arms to
play at catch-ball with <emph>that</emph>, I guess,</said> said Lam-
pard when he had replenished his cheek. <said>Where
<emph>is</emph> the boy?</said></p>
<p><said>Why, that's the puzzle!</said> returned <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby,
rubbing his chin reflectively. <said>You see Sam's
been away eight years, and, as far as I can make
out from what he said, wasn't very lucky. Couldn't
get a cargo home, and had to go trading from port
to port, and at last some two years ago he leaves
his ship and makes for the Californian diggings.</said></p>
<p><said>That's so,</said> put in the mate. <said>I joined the
ship at 'Frisco, and I was a bit taken aback when
<pb n="21"/>
<fw>Fifteen Pounds of Cold Iron.</fw>
I saw as the Cap'en was in command, 'cause I'd
met him up at the gold-fields.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, when Sam went away, the boy was
about two year old. Mother was dead, d'ye see,
and so Sam left the child in charge of some one,
and blest if that ain't all I know.</said></p>
<p><said>'Tain't much,</said> remarked the mate carelessly.</p>
<p><said>No; if poor Sam had only lasted another
five minutes he'd ha' told me all about the lad;
but I s'pose it wasn't to be, and so I shall rout it
out myself as best I may. But find Sam's boy I
will.</said></p>
<p>Jack Grigsby got up from his seat by the fire
—for it was a cold winter's day—stamped his
feet once or twice and walked up to the cannon-
ball, which he took from the floor with both hands
and poised for a minute or so.</p>
<p><said>It's a goodish weight,</said> said he; <said>fourteen or
fifteen pounds I should say.</said></p>
<p><said>Not an ounce less, I reckon,</said> replied the mate.
<said>You ain't going to take it away this afternoon,
air you?</said></p>
<p><said>I am so,</said> observed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, with deter-
mination. <said>That'll be safe and sound in Gibraltar
Cottage, Burford Street, Commercial Road, to-
night, come what may.</said></p>
<p><said>It won't give you much trouble to look after
it, I guess,</said> rejoined Lampard with a half laugh.
<said>Why, they wouldn't give you anything for it at
a rag shop.</said></p>
<pb n="22"/>
<fw>A Chinese on Deck.</fw>
<p><said>No matter; I promised Sam I'd take care of it,
and no man can say as Jack Grigsby ever broke
a promise. Here's my carpet-bag; it'll just go
in. Pretty good weight; but I'll have a cab when
I get into <abbr>St.</abbr> George's Street.</said></p>
<p>And the odd bequest of the poor skipper of
the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good Fortune</name> having been encased in Jack
Grigsby's faded and weather-worn carpet-bag,
which had travelled with him up and down the
river between Gravesend and London any num-
ber of times these ten years, the pilot dragged
his burden up the cabin stairs and prepared to
take his departure.</p>
<p>It was four o'clock in the afternoon, and the
dock bell was ringing as a signal for the labourers
to leave off their work of loading and unloading
cargoes. The day had been dark and dreary, and
as the evening approached a slight fog came
stealing up from the river. Still, it was not so
misty but that the whole of the deck of the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good
Fortune</name> could be seen, and it was only when you
looked towards the forest of masts that you be-
came conscious of the cloud of vapour which
threatened to become denser as the night wore
on.</p>
<p>On the deck near the cook-house one of the
crew was lounging. The others had been paid
off, and had left for shore—most of them to spend
in about a week what it had taken them twelve
to earn. This man was not at all like what
<pb n="23"/>
<fw>A Queer Crew.</fw>
most people imagine the British sailor to be. He
did not wear a straw hat, nor white trousers, nor
even a blue jacket with brass buttons. A blue
blouse, with short, wide, hanging sleeves, covered
his body, while his legs were encased in loose
baggy trousers of the same material—a stout
coarse cotton—as the blouse. Nor was his face
any more like the face of a Jack Tar than his
dress. A yellow complexion, high cheek bones,
and almond-shaped eyes sloping obliquely towards
the nose, marked him as belonging to the Mon-
golian race, while, if any doubt as to his nation-
ality was left, <emph>that</emph> was effectually settled by his
coal-black hair dragged off the forehead and
plaited into the characteristic pigtail of the China-
man.</p>
<p><said>I tell you what, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lampard,</said> said Jack
Grigsby, as he put his carpet-bag down on the
deck to rest a moment, <said>I don't think much of
your crew. That John Chineyman is bad enough,
but some of the other fellows I wouldn't take a
week's voyage with.</said></p>
<p><said>Wa-al,</said> drawled the mate, <said>we had a job to
get a crew at all at 'Frisco. There was a rush to
the gold-fields, and we had to take what we could
get, and that's a fact. We're not so mighty par-
ticular about our company in our country as you
are in yours.</said></p>
<p><said>So it seems. And that's the advantage we
have over you. We're not obliged to carry re-
<pb n="24"/>
<fw>Searched for Contraband.</fw>
volvers in our pockets to shoot down anybody we
see following us,</said> said Jack with a chuckle.</p>
<p><said>Wa-al, you've got some darned ugly customers
in your England too, I guess,</said> returned <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lam-
pard, a disagreeable look coming into his eyes.</p>
<p><said>Maybe,</said> said the bluff pilot cheerily. <said>Well,
I'll get on with my load, so I'll say good-night.</said></p>
<p><said>Good-night,</said> returned the mate.</p>
<p>Jack Grigsby walked with his heavy carpet-bag
down the gangway leading to the shore, for the
<name rend="i" type="vessel">Good Fortune</name> had been brought up alongside the
dock quay and the gangway had been laid down
for the convenience of unloading. Crowds of
dock labourers were hurrying towards the gates,
and the quays presented a busy scene. The pilot
threaded his way between huge casks, stacks of
boxes, and mountains of bags and sacks, stepped
over ropes and chains, and gradually neared the
gates. His pace was necessarily not a very rapid
one, and although he was a big, burly, strong
man in spite of his sixty years, he found the bag
increased in weight as he proceeded.</p>
<p>At the gates the men were being searched, but
the scrutiny was not a very severe one, the dock
official simply passing his hand over the region of
the pockets, and if there was any protuberance
making the man show what was the cause.
Simple as the process is, it is as a rule sufficient,
and rarely does a workman succeed in smuggling
out of the docks any tobacco, cigars, or spirits.</p>
<pb n="25"/>
<fw>Jack Grigsby's Bag.</fw>
<p>The official, of course, knew Jack Grigsby—
who at the London Docks did not?—and he
nodded good-humouredly as the pilot came up.</p>
<p><said>Caught you this time, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, have I?</said>
said the man jokingly. <said>I suppose you thought
I shouldn't notice your bag.</said></p>
<p><said>That's it, Joe,</said> returned Jack. <said>You've seen
it so often it's most part of me, eh?</said></p>
<p><said>What's inside? Old Jamaica?</said></p>
<p><said>Feel the weight and then tell me.</said></p>
<p>The man incautiously took the bag between his
finger and thumb, and not suspecting how heavy
it was, found he could not hold it. He made an
effort to recover his grasp but it was of no use;
down came the bag with a crash and up jumped
the official some six inches into the air with an
agonized expression on his face. The bag with
its cannon-ball had fallen on to his toe.</p>
<p><said>You've done a pretty thing,</said> remarked <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Grigsby in pretended indignation. <said>Smashed a
bottle of as fine rum as ever was smuggled.</said></p>
<p><said>Glad of it. It's nearly smashed my toe, I
know that,</said> groaned the injured Joe.</p>
<p>It was his duty, of course, to open the bag and
examine its contents, and this, grumbling the
while at the trick which had been played him, he
proceeded to do.</p>
<p><said>Why, what on earth have you got here?</said> he
exclaimed, starting when his hand came in con-
tact with the cold iron.</p>
<pb n="26"/>
<fw><abbr>St.</abbr> George's Street.</fw>
<p><said>Only a cannon-ball. There's no duty on it,
Joe, my lad. You can let it pass,</said> chuckled the
pilot.</p>
<p>The official shut to the bag with a loud snap
and handed it back to its owner, this time taking
the precaution to lift it with both hands.</p>
<p><said>You don't catch me a second time like this,
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby.</said></p>
<p><said>All right, Joe; but don't you take me for a
smuggler again, that's all.</said></p>
<p>And bidding the official a cheery <q>good-night</q>
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby passed through the gates into Old
Gravel Lane, and so up this dirty narrow outlet,
now quite inclosed on one side by the London
Docks, into the outer world of Shadwell.</p>
<p>He was glad when he got into <abbr>St.</abbr> George's
Street, which is the main artery of this waterside
neighbourhood, leading in the west to the Tower
of London, in the east to High Street, Shadwell,
and Limehouse. Not many years ago <abbr>St.</abbr> George's
Street used to be called in the maps of London
<q>Ratcliff Highway,</q> and indeed is better known
to the inhabitants to-day under that name; but as
Ratcliff Highway was once associated with rob-
bery and even murder, it was thought that its
evil reputation would be forgotten when it was
changed into <abbr>St.</abbr> George's Street. To a certain
extent this is true. Ratcliff Highway, though
not the most respectable and orderly thoroughfare
in the world, is not nearly so bad as it formerly was.</p>
<pb n="27"/>
<fw>A Street Arab.</fw>
<p>But Jack Grigsby was not concerned with either
the past or present aspect of Ratcliff Highway.
A cab was at that moment uppermost in his
thoughts. He looked to the right and he looked
to the left but no cab could be seen, and after
waiting two or three minutes he determined to
walk to his house, the distance to which was not
more than a mile.</p>
<p>Now between <abbr>St.</abbr> George's Street and the Com-
mercial Road are a number of narrow, dirty
streets. The inhabitants are like the houses,
dingy and shabby in appearance, and the whole
appearance of the district is one of poverty.</p>
<p>Along one of the dirtiest and most narrow of
these streets Jack Grigsby trudged, and behind
him walked or rather slunk a boy who for grime
on his face and hands and tatters in his clothes
could not easily be matched even in the great city
of London, where there are so many boys grimy
and tattered. This street arab had no shoes or
stockings on his feet, a fragment of a shirt covered
his back, chest, and one shoulder, leaving the
other exposed, while a huge pair of ragged cor-
duroy trousers, held up by a piece of string in
place of a brace, came almost as high as his arm-
pits. His hair was as much like a mop as it
was possible for hair to be, and from between its
uncombed locks, which straggled over his fore-
head, peered a pair of bright eyes, which, even by
the glimmer of a street lamp feebly making its
<pb n="28"/>
<fw>Rather Too Heavy.</fw>
way through the fog, could be seen were full of
intelligence.</p>
<p>This boy had followed the pilot for some few
yards, and when the latter stopped a moment to
rest himself he sidled up to the old man.</p>
<p><said>Buy a box o' lights, sir?</said> said he.</p>
<p><said>Lights, you young shaver? Will your lights
show me the way through the fog, eh?</said></p>
<p><said>In course they will, sir, if you buys enough on
'em,</said> returned the boy with a laugh that showed
two rows of even white teeth.</p>
<p>Jack Grigsby looked at the little fellow and
shook his head.</p>
<p><said>Ah, you're a sharp 'un, <emph>I</emph> can see. But I don't
want any lights for all that.</said></p>
<p><said>Shall I carry your bag for you, sir, then?</said></p>
<p>The pilot stared. The boy was miserably thin,
and scarcely more than ten years old, and the
idea of his carrying a weight of fifteen pounds or
so was absurd.</p>
<p><said><emph>You</emph> carry it, you sparrow—why, you couldn't
even lift it.</said></p>
<p><said>Couldn't I?</said> returned the boy scornfully. <said>I'm
stronger than you thinks, mister.</said> And he seized
hold of the handle of the bag and tried valiantly
to get it on his shoulder; but Jack Grigsby was
right, he could scarcely raise it from the ground.</p>
<p><said>That's a jolly weight, and no mistake,</said> said the
arab ruefully. <said>I thought as I could do it too.
It's hard, ain't it, when you wants to earn a copper.</said></p>
<pb n="29"/>
<fw>A Nice Question.</fw>
<p><said>Well, it isn't <emph>your</emph> fault, my lad. You shall
have your copper all the same.</said></p>
<p>The boy's eyes glistened as the good-natured
pilot dropped a penny into his hands, and with
a <said>Thank ye, sir,</said> he flitted away in the contrary
direction from that in which Jack Grigsby was
going.</p>
<p><said>That was a bit o' luck, blest if it warn't,</said>
chuckled the young arab, clutching the penny
tight in his hand. <said>And me so awful peckish too.
What'll I buy with it? Eel-pie or a buster?</said></p>
<p>This was a very important question for our
young friend to decide. There was a cavity of
considerable size inside his small body which
required filling, and nothing for the price of a
penny could do it so well as a <soCalled>buster,</soCalled> in other
words a French roll. But rolls are dry, cheerless
eating on a cold, foggy night, and he couldn't re-
sist the vision of a hot, rich, savoury eel-pie.</p>
<p><said>I could eat a dozen on 'em,</said> he muttered, the
water coming into his mouth at the thought.</p>
<p>The eel-pie had it, and off he darted at a smart
pace to indulge in the luxury; and so absorbed
was he in the anticipation of his supper that he
ran full tilt into the waistcoat of some one who
was coming swiftly the other way.</p>
<p><said>Thunder and lightning! Pork and apple sass!</said>
ejaculated the stranger on feeling as though a
cannon-ball had caught him amidships.</p>
<p>The boy rubbed his head, which had struck
<pb n="30"/>
<fw>A Worthy Pair.</fw>
against something hard in one of the pockets of
the man's pea-jacket, but said nothing. He was,
in fact, too bewildered by the shock.</p>
<p>He was about to hurry away when the man
caught hold of him roughly. <said>Hullo, younker,
not so fast. I want to speak to you, I guess.
Look here, have you seen anybody go down this
street with a carpet-bag in his hand?</said></p>
<p><said>What, an old gent, d'ye mean, guv'nor?</said></p>
<p><said>Aye, aye. How long ago was it? You tell
me the straight truth and you bet I'll—I'll give
you sixpence.</said></p>
<p>The boy's eyes sparkled, sixpence to him repre-
sented a mine of wealth.</p>
<p><said>All right, mister. You go down the street,
and make haste and you'll catch him. It ain't
more'n a minute since I see him.</said></p>
<p>No sooner had he said the words than the man,
a long, lanky fellow, darted off followed by a com-
panion whom the boy had not before noticed, but
who was plain enough now to be seen and also to
be remembered, for he was a Chinaman, pigtail
and all complete.</p>
<p>Perhaps the arab would have remarked him
still more had not the whole of his faculties been
absorbed by the fact that the tall man had run
away without giving him the sixpence he had pro-
mised. Determined not to be done out of his
rightful earnings he first shouted, and no notice
being taken, commenced also to run. But the fog
<pb n="31"/>
<fw>The Hunters Hunted.</fw>
had become so thick he found it no easy matter to
see more than two or three yards before him,
and after vainly striving to discover the two men
gave up the search in despair.</p>
<p>Now the boy, as I have said, had no shoes and
stockings on his feet, and his steps consequently
made no noise. It was therefore not surprising
that he should suddenly come upon the very people
whom he was seeking, without himself being ob-
served. But strange to say, when he made this
discovery he said not a word, and you will pre-
sently see the reason.</p>
<p>From the hurry the tall man was in, one would
naturally suppose he would make all possible
haste to overtake the person he wanted. The
boy, therefore, was greatly surprised to see him
creeping cautiously close to the houses, followed
at a short distance by the pig-tailed Chinaman.</p>
<p>To a boy accustomed to good clothes, to good
dinners and to a comfortable home, this cautious
method of walking might not have suggested any-
thing in particular; but to our ragged young
friend, who had been accustomed to make his
home in the streets, and those streets the streets
about Ratcliff Highway, it meant a great deal.</p>
<p><said>My eye,</said> muttered the boy, <said>if they ain't after
that old gent as gave me the copper! I know'd
the tall chap warn't no good or he wouldn't ha'
cheated <emph>me</emph>. And the sneaking Chaneyman too.
I'll spoil their game if I can, that I will.</said></p>

<head type="main">A Night Attack</head>

<p>It was the easiest thing in the world for the
lad to creep behind the two men unob-
served. He was so thin and shadowy, so
used to crouching in corners and squeezing into
nooks, that really one would say he was able to
reduce himself to less than his proper stature.</p>
<p>And so the crouching figures in front never
suspected that within a little more than a yard,
and treading almost upon their very footsteps,
was a little sharp-eyed boy, with all his faculties
on the alert and ready for action.</p>
<p>By-and-by the three neared Jack Grigsby, who
with the weight in the bag was walking slowly.
By the dim yellow light of a gas lamp they
could see him swaying to and fro in his sailor
fashion, and when he had passed the lamp he
put the bag down on the pavement prepara-
tory to changing it into the other hand. Now
was the time for the attack. Turning round, the
tall man made a signal to the Chinese, who came
<pb n="33"/>
<fw>The Use of a Pig-Tail.</fw>
to a dead stop immediately in front of the lamp-
post. His companion then darted swiftly into
the road and disappeared. To the boy's active
mind the proceedings were intelligible enough.
Evidently the assault was to be made in the
front and the rear at the same time.</p>
<p>Now the lad standing immediately behind the
Chinese, with only the lamp-post between them,
could not help seeing the long, black, shining,
snake-like pigtail. Whipping off his braces, which
you will remember were nothing but string, he
seized the pigtail gently, and bound it tightly to
the lamp-post. Scarcely had he finished than he
heard a low whistle. The Chinese bent his knees
slightly, lowered his head, and gathered all his
strength for a terrific leap upon the unconscious
pilot, who at that moment was stooping to pick
up the bag. A second of time, which to the boy
appeared like an hour, and then followed a shrill
cry of agony from the Chinaman, who had the
double sensation firstly of having all the hairs of
his head pulled out by the roots, and secondly
of having them knocked in again by the lamp-
post, against which he rebounded with tremen-
dous force.</p>
<p>The voice of a Chinese is totally unlike that
of an Englishman. It is a thin, piping shriek,
and coming so unexpectedly, it startled Jack
Grigsby to such an extent that the bag dropped
from his hand and fell with a loud thud on the
<pb n="34"/>
<fw>Victory!</fw>
pavement. Almost at the same time a tall lanky
form rushing from the road stumbled over it and
went sprawling through the air, a murky vision
of arms and legs.</p>
<p>Jack Grigsby had had too many ups and
downs in the world to be taken easily by sur-
prise. He could not understand what it all
meant, but he had a suspicion that robbery was
at the bottom of the business. However, the
only thing certain was that somebody was lying
on the ground, and that that somebody was cer-
tainly stunned, for he was lying quite still and
motionless.</p>
<p><said>This is a mighty queer business,</said> growled
the pilot, bending over the prostrate figure, <said>what
cheer, mate? Let's look at your figure-head?</said></p>
<p>And he laid hold of the man to lift him from
the ground, when the latter suddenly rolled out
of the pilot's grasp, and springing to his feet
bounded out of sight.</p>
<p><said>Well—I'm blest!</said> was the only observation
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby felt equal to. He stood still for a
moment vainly staring at the fog, scratched his
head slowly, and gave a long whistle.</p>
<p><said>There was some one else,</said> he muttered half
aloud. <said>That warn't a man's voice as I heard
a-screaming behind me.</said></p>
<p>But not a soul could he see save the little
London arab, who came sidling up with a trium-
phant look on his sharp face.</p>
<pb n="35"/>
<fw><q>Ned Nothing.</q></fw>
<p><said>Hallo! you young shaver; was it <emph>you</emph> making
that hullaballoo just now?</said></p>
<p><said>No, that it wasn't. <emph>He's</emph> got away, <emph>he</emph> has.
Took out his knife and cut a bit off his tail!</said>
and the boy's eyes fairly danced with glee.</p>
<p>Jack Grigsby was thoroughly mystified. Cut
off a bit of his tail?—whose tail?—what tail?</p>
<p><said>Now don't you come any Ratcliff Highway
tricks over me,</said> returned the old man, putting
on as severe a look as his round jolly face was
capable of, <said>because I'm none of your green hands.</said></p>
<p><said>I havn't got no tricks, mister. It's all true
every word of it.</said></p>
<p>And with a good deal of expressive action, and
with great flow of speech, the boy told how he
had seen the men creeping along the street, how
he had followed them, and how he had secured
the Chinaman, producing triumphantly the ex-
treme end of the pigtail—a knot of hair tied with
a ribbon—as a proof.</p>
<p>It was a very curious affair, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby
could make nothing of it. He cross-questioned
the boy, but the latter stuck to his story, and
described the persons of Hosea Lampard and Ah
Ling Foo so accurately that the pilot could no
longer doubt the truth of what he said.</p>
<p><said>What's your name, boy?</said> said he after a
pause, during which he had been staring intently
into the lad's face.</p>
<p><said>Ned, sir.</said></p>
<pb n="36"/>
<fw>Homeward Bound.</fw>
<p><said>Ned what?</said></p>
<p><said>Ned nothing, sir. Never been called any-
thing else as I knows.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, Ned Nothing, where d'ye live?</said></p>
<p><said>Anywhere, sir. I ain't pertikler. Mostly in
the streets in the day, and when the night comes
I creeps where I can. I know a good place
down a stable-yard where the man lets me get
in a cart, and it's regilar snug too if there's a bit
o' straw.</said></p>
<p>Jack Grigsby's honest heart swelled within
him. It seemed monstrous that in London, the
richest city in the world, a poor little mortal like
this boy should be allowed to exist in such a
state of utter misery and desolation.</p>
<p><said>I can't make it out, that I can't,</said> he muttered
to himself. <said>There's something wrong some-
where, blest if there isn't. This lad's a sharp
chap, and if what he says is true, he's done me
a sarvice as it oughtn't to be in me to forget.
Look here, Ned Nothing,</said> said he aloud, <said>would
you like to sleep in a bed?</said></p>
<p><said>What! a real bed with real blankets and
pillers?</said></p>
<p><said>Aye.</said></p>
<p><said>Shouldn't I just!</said></p>
<p><said>Then you shall. Here, come along with me.</said></p>
<p>And once more that troublesome bag was
lifted, and between them—Jack Grigsby laying
hold of one handle and Ned the other—was
<pb n="37"/>
<fw>The Pilot's House.</fw>
carried into the Commercial Road, and so into
Burford Street, where was the pilot's house.</p>
<p>A remarkable house it was too. Burford
Street is nearly half a mile long, as straight as a
needle, and without a turning to the right or the
left from one end to the other. All the houses
are built on the same pattern, and so nearly alike
that with the exception of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's there is
not a pin to choose between any of them.</p>
<p>But what made the pilot's house so remarkable
was not its architecture, for in that respect it was
like all the rest, but its adornments, all of which
were Jack's own designing, and very proud he
was of them. For instance, being clever with his
hands, as most sailors are, he had built up an
elaborate structure of grotto-work in the little
garden—garden? well, it was scarcely big enough
to be called a yard, say 4 feet by about 10—in
front of the house, in which flints, brickbats, and
oyster-shells and cement were cunningly inter-
mingled, and where in the summer time flowers
were artfully disposed. Then instead of flag-
stones in front of the door he had put down a
pavement of his own invention, which really
looked very well, while you would never have
guessed that the round tile-like stoneware of which
it was made was nothing more nor less than the
bottoms of ginger-beer bottles. As for the door
itself and the railings, they were literally as fresh
as paint, for they were both continually receiving
<pb n="38"/>
<fw>A Fairy.</fw>
new coats. The brass knocker, the brass door-
knob, and even the very keyhole always shone as
brilliantly as they could be made to do by brick-
dust and wash-leather, while the venetian blinds
in the windows were of so bright a green that
they almost made you wink as you looked at
them. Jack Grigsby had bought his house with
the savings of many years, and was never tired
of beautifying it.</p>
<p><said>Here we are, Ned,</said> he remarked as he pushed
open the iron gate, <said>and precious glad I am to
be home again, I can tell you.</said></p>
<p>The gate as it swung creaked on its hinges, and
the sound must have been heard inside the house,
for scarcely had <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby knocked before the
door was opened, and what seemed to Ned like
one of the fairies in a pantomime—which he had
once seen at the Pavilion Theatre in the White-
chapel Road, having scraped up threepence, the
price of admission to the gallery—bounded out,
and putting her arms round Jack Grigsby's neck,
kissed him first on one cheek, and then on the other.</p>
<p><said>Come in, you dear!</said> exclaimed the fairy in
the brightest and prettiest of voices. <said>Grand-
mother said you were lost in the fog, but I said
I was <emph>sure</emph> you'd find your way home, and I was
right, you see.</said></p>
<p><said>As you always are, puss,</said> returned Jack
Grigsby, his eyes beaming with pride.</p>
<p><said>Bring the bag in here, little boy,</said> said she
<pb n="39"/>
<fw>The Old Lady.</fw>
patronizingly to Ned—she was about the same
age and scarcely so tall.</p>
<p><said>Stay, Nellie, my girl. He can't lift it by him-
self. We'll bring it in together.</said></p>
<p>And so they did, Jack Grigsby shutting the
door behind him.</p>
<p><said>Why, whatever have you got inside, grand-
father? Is it a present for me?</said> said the girl,
who, now that she was standing in the light, Ned
could see was a golden-haired blue-eyed little
maiden, with a pretty colour on her cheeks and
merry smile on her red lips.</p>
<p><said>No, Nell, 'tisn't for you.</said></p>
<p><said>Then it <emph>is</emph> a present for some one. Oh, do
let me look!</said></p>
<p><said>Aye, aye, you shall look all in good time.</said></p>
<p>Meanwhile the bag had been brought into the
parlour, where was sitting close by the fire in a
large leathern-covered chair an old lady with
snowy white hair smoothed neatly over her placid
forehead. Her head was raised in a curiously in-
quiring manner, and there was a singular look in
her eyes, a look like which Ned had never seen
in anybody else's.</p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby went directly up to the old lady
and kissed her.</p>
<p><said>Well, old woman,</said> said he cheerily, <said>how
goes it?</said></p>
<p><said>You're late, John, arn't you? The ship came
into dock this morning, didn't it?</said></p>
<pb n="40"/>
<fw>Seeing by Touch.</fw>
<p><said>Aye, aye—I've a long yarn to spin to you,
missis. You remember Sam Somerset, don't you?
Well—but I'll tell you all when we've had some
tea. Nell, my girl, what about the kettle?</said></p>
<p>All this time Ned stood wonderingly in the
comfortable little room waiting for further orders.
It was enough pleasure for him to watch the airy
form of Nellie flitting about the old pilot, taking
off his comforter, hanging up his cap, and helping
him to remove his great-coat. How he wished
<emph>he</emph> had a great-coat that so pretty a little maid
might do the same office for him! All at once
his reverie was disturbed by the old woman say-
ing sharply:</p>
<p><said>John, there is a stranger in the room. Who
is it?</said></p>
<p><said>A boy, my dear, a boy—he's part of my story.
If it hadn't been for the youngster I mightn't ha'
been here to-night. Ned, my lad, come here.</said></p>
<p>Which Ned did, and standing by the old lady
the latter passed her hand lightly over his fea-
tures, and then across his chest and back.</p>
<p><said>Why, John, the boy's scarcely any clothes on.</said></p>
<p><said>That's a fact. We'll have to get some slops
for him and make him decent.</said></p>
<p><said>Nellie,</said> said again <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby, <said>tell me
what he is like.</said></p>
<p><said aloud="false">Well,</said> thought Ned, <said aloud="false">you're the funniest old
woman I know. Can't you see for yourself what
I'm like.</said></p>
<pb n="41"/>
<fw>Ned Made Fit for Company.</fw>
<p>He looked up in <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby's face, and a
curious feeling came over him. He could not tell
why, for her eyes seemed to be as good as yours
or mine; but it suddenly occurred to him what
was the matter with her. She was blind.</p>
<p>And so the little girl came and stood by the
old lady's knee and inspected Ned with a grave
and business-like air.</p>
<p><said>He's a nice little boy, grandmother, but his
face is very dirty, and his hair hasn't been brushed,
oh, for ever so long—quite a week, I daresay.
He's only got a shirt on and a pair of trousers,
and oh, granny—<emph>no</emph> shoes and stockings. Mayn't
he have a pair of mine?</said></p>
<p><said>We'll look after that, Nell. Now, Ned Noth-
ing, you come in the kitchen and have a good
wash before we talk about anything else.</said></p>
<p>Accordingly Ned followed the pilot out into
quite a model kitchen, where everything that
was of metal, the dish-covers, the copper kettle,
the teapot, the coffee-pot, and I don't know what
besides, was perfectly dazzling in its brightness.
Busily engaged in preparing tea was an apple-
cheeked girl, who certainly looked astonished
when the lad followed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, and stood
there in what she afterwards described as a <q>mash
of rags,</q> half afraid to tread upon the bright oil-
cloth.</p>
<p><said>Give him a basin—a good big one, Hannah,
plenty of warm water and soap, and a jack-
<pb n="42"/>
<fw>John Grigsby's Story.</fw>
towel,</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby; <said>and you, Ned Noth-
ing, scrub away. D'ye hear?</said></p>
<p>And leaving Ned to his task the pilot returned
to the parlour, where his blind wife and his
granddaughter were busily talking over Ned's ap-
pearance, and what grandfather was going to do
with him.</p>
<p><said>We must see if we can't find room for the lad,
Jennie, and make him useful,</said> said Jack. <said>He
hain't got ne'er a one to look arter him, nor any-
thing like a home. Been sleeping in the streets.
Think o' that, Nell.</said></p>
<p><said>Poor boy,</said> said Nell sympathizingly.</p>
<p><said>My dear John, he isn't a thief, is he?</said> said
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby, dropping her voice.</p>
<p><said>Not he,</said> replied her husband stoutly. <said>His
face is enough for me. But that ain't all. Just
give me a cup o' tea to wash the fog out of my
throat, and I'll tell you a little story.</said></p>
<p>Upon which Nellie seized the homely brown
earthenware teapot, having first daintily put a
lump of sugar and some milk into a real china
cup of a rare old pattern, and poured out a cup
of tea, the old man looking on the while with
beaming eyes.</p>
<p>When he had refreshed himself <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby
told with much detail and appropriate action the
whole story of his adventures from the time he
first went on board the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good Fortune</name>, and heard
of the death of Captain Somerset, who had been
<pb n="43"/>
<fw>The Safe Side.</fw>
ailing all the voyage and had been taken seriously
ill when in the Bay of Biscay, down to the at-
tempted assault on his way home.</p>
<p><said>I never heard of such a thing!</said> exclaimed
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby, lifting up her hands in wonderment.
<said>I should certainly go to the police and let <emph>them</emph>
take it up.</said></p>
<p><said>I don't know,</said> returned the pilot doubtfully.
<said>You see they didn't actshally 'sault me, though
it was mighty near. And then there's only the
boy's word as to their a-follerin' me, not but what
<emph>he</emph> spoke the truth right enough. But I'll tell you
what I'll do. I'll go down to the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Fortun'</name> and
tackle that long-legged, lantern-jawed Yankee,
and if I don't bring him to book—</said></p>
<p><said>No you won't, John,</said> put in the blind woman.
<said>Better let it alone. If you go to the ship I
know what will happen. You'll get out of temper,
there'll be a quarrel, and you know very well
those forriners think nothing of taking out their
knives and—</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, grandfather, you mustn't go,</said> interrupted
Nellie, with her blue eyes full of fright and her
hands clasped.</p>
<p>As a rule Jack Grigsby did exactly as his wife
told him. He had a kind of belief that one sense
being taken from her the others were thereby
made more acute, and he really looked upon her
as a kind of oracle. But in this case he felt that
the rascals who wanted to rob him ought to be
<pb n="44"/>
<fw><q>A Bit of Tailoring.</q></fw>
punished, and it was only after a good deal of
argument that he allowed himself to be per-
suaded that the best course would be to take no
notice.</p>
<p><said>All right, my dear; then if you wish it I'll
let the lubbers go scot free, though if ever I meet
with that yellow-faced Chinaman or that lanky
New Yorker I'll—</said></p>
<p>But what <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby would have done he did
not say, for just then came a knock at the door
and a request from Hannah, the maid of all work,
that <q>Master would tell her what was to be done
with that boy.</q></p>
<p><said>I'll come and have a look at him,</said> said the
pilot.</p>
<p>He found Ned standing near the fire with his
face all in a glow from the scrubbing he had
given it, and his hair brushed to as smooth a con-
dition as its length and tangled condition would
permit.</p>
<p><said>Ah! that's more like. Cleanliness is next
door to godliness, Ned, my lad. Remember <emph>that</emph>.
But you can't sit down to tea in those rags. Get
down my short pea-jacket, Ann, and we'll do a
bit of tailoring.</said></p>
<p>Accordingly the pea-jacket was tried on, and
after about half a yard had been taken in at the
back and the sleeves turned up six inches or so,
it made a fairly presentable figure seen from the
front, though the back view must have been
<pb n="45"/>
<fw>Something Like a Tea.</fw>
rather comical, at least judging from Hannah's
giggles as she watched the two go into the
parlour.</p>
<p><said>Eatin' first, talkin' afterwards, Ned. Take
in cargo, mate, but take care you don't overload
the ship.</said></p>
<p>Ned did not need a second bidding. To his
wondering eyes heaven seemed presented to him
in the bread and butter, the muffins, the shrimps,
and the slices of ham with which the table was
loaded. He strictly obeyed the words of the
<soCalled>captain,</soCalled> as he called Jack Grigsby, and for
fifteen minutes had no other occupation for his
mouth than eating and drinking.</p>
<p>To the little girl it was great fun to see the
ravenous boy devour the food. At the same time
she felt sorry, because to be so hungry he must,
she thought, have been half starved before.</p>
<p>At last Ned was obliged to own himself con-
quered. He had maintained the fight valiantly,
but at the end of his sixth slice of bread and
butter, his fourth muffin, to say nothing of
shrimps and ham, he gave in and said he could
eat no more.</p>
<p><said>Well, you ain't done bad,</said> pronounced <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Grigsby; <said>and now we'll see about them togs.</said></p>
<p>A message to the nearest clothier's brought
several suits, and under the inspecting eye of the
pilot Ned soon found something which fitted him.
It was really wonderful to see what a change
<pb n="46"/>
<fw>What's to be Done with Ned?</fw>
decent clothes made in the boy, and Ned seemed
conscious of it too, for, as Jack Grigsby afterwards
said, he strutted about as vain as a peacock.</p>
<p>That night, after Nellie had gone to bed, and
Ned also (the latter having a bed made up for
him on the floor of a kind of lumber room), Jack
Grigsby and his <soCalled>missus,</soCalled> as he called her, had
a serious talk about the trust which Captain
Somerset had imposed upon him, and it was
agreed between the two that he should do his
best to carry it out, commencing his search by a
journey to Lincoln, where the captain's only sister
lived.</p>
<p><said>Well, there's his legacy,</said> said Jack, pointing
with his pipe stem to the cannon-ball, which had
been removed from the bag to satisfy Nellie's
curiosity and placed upon the sideboard. <said>Not
that it's worth much. But I s'pose there's some-
thing due from the owners of the ship, and that
ought to go to his boy, if we can find him.</said></p>
<p><said>And if anybody can do it, it's you, John; for
when you take a thing in your head you're the
most obstinate man in the world,</said> said the old
lady with a kindly smile.</p>
<p><said>Then we're well matched, Jennie, for you're
the most obstinate woman,</said> chuckled Jack.
<said>But, my dear,</said> he continued in a more serious
tone, <said>what shall we do about this young Ned
Nothing?</said></p>
<p><said>Is that his name?</said></p>
<pb n="47"/>
<fw>At Anchor.</fw>
<p><said>Well, not exactly,</said> said the old man, rub-
bing his nose reflectively. <said>His name's Ned
and nothing else, and that's why I calls him Ned
Nothing. But what shall we do with him?</said> he
repeated.</p>
<p><said>Do <emph>you</emph> wish that he should live with us,
John?</said></p>
<p><said>Well, I feels a liking for the lad, o' course.
The poor little chap's so lonely like; it seems
a thundering shame as he should go to the bad
just for want of a helping hand, don't it, Jennie?
And so sharp and clever as he is too.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes,</said> returned the old woman emphatically.
<said>It would not be a Christian act to turn him
adrift when it's in our power to save him.</said></p>
<p><said>It's like you to say that, missus—not but
what I thought you would,</said> said Jack, with his
eyes beaming.</p>
<p>And so it was settled that Ned should remain.</p>

<head type="main">In which Ned makes Himself at Home</head>

<p>Ned was in his way a character. One of
his peculiarities was his unbounded in-
dustry. In a very short time he had
made himself acquainted with all that was in
the house and garden, and never so happy as
when, hammer in hand, he was doing a job at
carpentering. His first effort was mending a
doll's-house, which task he executed to the per-
fect satisfaction of Nellie, who looked on gravely
while he put on a hinge and nailed up a broken
balcony.</p>
<p>The garden was an especial delight, for here
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby had erected a mast with rigging and
spars all complete, and from which on high days
and holidays a flag proudly floated. There was
also an arbour made out of an old boat, over
which in the summer time scarlet-runners used to
grow. There were all sorts of quaint foreign
shells, an enormous piece of that curiously cor-
rugated limestone rock called <soCalled>brain</soCalled> stone, and
<pb n="49"/>
<fw>Admiral Byng.</fw>
a comical figure-head of a ship supposed to
represent the unfortunate Admiral Byng, and
whose countenance was so battered and bruised
by the nails which had been driven in to support
clothes-lines that he looked a hundred times
more miserable and woebegone than his unlucky
original, in spite of his sad fate, could ever have
looked in his life.</p>
<p>This <soCalled>Admiral</soCalled> had been the particular play-
mate of Nellie before Ned's arrival. He was in
turn a child, a patriarchic relative, or a middle-
aged gentleman, just as the young lady's fancy
prompted. She had praised him, scolded him,
was ceremoniously polite to him, and had identi-
fied him with all kinds of imaginary personages.
In fact, he was in her estimation quite a real and
distinctive being, and so after a while Ned came
to regard him, especially when Nellie had related
the story how the admiral was shot for not win-
ning a battle.</p>
<p><said>I say, Miss Nellie, just look at old Bung.
Ain't he got an awful cold in his eye?</said> observed
Ned one morning about a fortnight after taking
up his residence at Burford Street.</p>
<p>The night had been frosty, and some moisture
which had collected on the admiral's goggle-eye
had frozen into an icicle, which looked remarkably
like a gigantic tear.</p>
<p><said>So he has,</said> said the little girl laughing. <said>But,
Ned, don't say Bung. His name's Bing—B-y-n-g.</said></p>
<pb n="50"/>
<fw>Ned's Early Schooling.</fw>
<p><said>Oh, does that spell Bing?</said> said Ned, wonder-
ingly.</p>
<p><said>Of course it does. Haven't you ever been to
school and learned how to spell words?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, I went to school once. A Ragged
School they calls it. Ah! and didn't we get jolly
soup sometimes. We did have blow-outs and no
mistake.</said></p>
<p><said>You mustn't say <q>blow-outs;</q> it's vulgar,</said>
said Nellie severely.</p>
<p><said>What's vulgar?</said> asked the boy.</p>
<p><said>Oh—why, it's being rude and disagreeable. I
don't like vulgar people.</said></p>
<p><said>Don't you, Miss Nellie? Then I'll try not to
be vulgar.</said></p>
<p>Ned was chopping some wood during this con-
versation, and having signified the determination
just recorded he emphasized it by bringing his
chopper down with double force.</p>
<p><said>Didn't you like being at school?</said> presently
asked the little girl.</p>
<p><said>Oh, yes, I liked it well enough. But I didn't
go for long, 'cause they shut it up.</said></p>
<p><said>Why was that?</said></p>
<p><said>Hadn't got no money to keep it open, so they
tells me. And so I never went to another.</said></p>
<p><said>But you'll have to go, you know. I heard
grandmother speaking about it last night.</said></p>
<p><said>Did you, miss?</said> The chopper was suspended
for a while in mid air.</p>
<pb n="51"/>
<fw>A Dream of Former Days.</fw>
<p><said>Yes. You'll like school, won't you? <emph>I</emph> do.</said></p>
<p><said>Then so shall I;</said> and crash went the chopper
once more.</p>
<p>For at least five minutes Ned went on work-
ing vigorously, until his face became quite flushed
with the exercise, and he was obliged to rest a
while.</p>
<p><said>Did you ever have a mother?</said> asked Nellie,
who, perched upon a fragment of an old capstan,
had been surveying the process of wood-chopping
with great gravity and interest.</p>
<p>The question rather took Ned aback, for it was
one that he had never considered. Had he ever
a mother? No, he couldn't say he had; leastways
he couldn't remember.</p>
<p><said>I haven't got one neither,</said> said Nellie. <said>My
mother died—oh, ever so many years ago when
I was a little tiny mite.</said></p>
<p><said>Ah,</said> returned Ned, fully impressed with the
length of time pictured by <q>ever so many years,</q>
and with the diminutive appearance of Nellie at
the time. <said>Not that I run'd about the streets
always,</said> he continued in a ruminative manner as
if he had a faint and shadowy claim to respecta-
bility. <said>I must have been a young <choice><corr>'un</corr><orig>un'</orig></choice> though,
for it's just like going to sleep and dreaming-like
when I thinks about it. It's an ugly, bad dream,
too,</said> he added.</p>
<p><said>Tell me something of it, Ned. I'm fond of
dreams,</said> exclaimed the child enthusiastically.
<pb n="52"/>
<fw>Ugly Memories.</fw>
<said>And I have such beautiful ones too, all about
dolls, and going to the pantomime—and—and—
dancing, and—all like that, you know.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, I know,</said> returned Ned with a nod; <said>but
them's make-believe dreams. Mine's regular real
ones. I used to be knocked about awful—not
but what I've been knocked about in the streets,
but then a crack on the head don't hurt much if
you dodge; but in them bad real dreams it was
a stick, and a hard 'un too. It was an ugly chap
as give 'em to me too, and if ever I meets him
when I'm growed up I'll—well, I'll pay him back,
that's all.</said></p>
<p>Ned's face grew dark, and he swung the chop-
per in the air and clove a piece of wood in two
with such force that the pieces flew some distance
apart.</p>
<p><said>Don't you know it's wicked to say that,</said> said
Nellie, her large blue eyes opening wide at the
boy's unwonted violence.</p>
<p><said>I can't help it,</said> he replied doggedly. <said>I shall
know him again too—ah, if he was to alter him-
self ever so much. It was him as sent me in the
streets when I warn't no more'n that high,</said> mark-
ing off with his hand a space about three feet
from the ground.</p>
<p><said>Yes, but what did he do it for?</said> asked the
little girl.</p>
<p><said>I don't know. Didn't like me, I s'pose. There
was a woman as warn't so bad, but lor she was as
<pb n="53"/>
<fw><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby Comes Home to Dinner.</fw>
timid as a mouse and quite afeard of him. If it
hadn't been for old Biddy I should ha' starved
precious quick. Ah, she was a good sort, that she
was. Used to sell apples at a stall, you know, in
the summer, and roast chestnuts in the winter.
Ah, they <emph>was</emph> jolly if you like,</said> said Ned pen-
sively. <said>Many's the time as I've made a dinner
of 'em.</said></p>
<p><said>And where's Biddy now?</said> asked Nellie.</p>
<p><said>In the work'us. She got took ill and couldn't
stand it no longer. If I ever get any money I'd
take some to old Biddy. She always gave me
anything as she'd got.</said></p>
<p>Just then came <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby's voice calling out
that dinner was ready, and in the two went quite
prepared for the meal.</p>
<p><said>Isn't grandfather coming home to dinner?</said>
said Nellie, noticing that no knife and fork were
set for the old pilot.</p>
<p><said>No, my dear. I'm going to keep some warm
for him in the oven. He said he wasn't quite
sure how long he'd be, and we were not to wait
for him. But he thought he wouldn't be much
later than two.</said></p>
<p>And <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby was as good as his word, for
scarcely had the cuckoo clock on the mantel-shelf
sounded twice before his well-known step was
heard.</p>
<p><said>Take my hat, Nell—there's my stick, Ned,</said>
said the cheery old man when he had come to
<pb n="54"/>
<fw>Captain Somerset's Sister.</fw>
anchor in the easy chair. <said>Well, old lady, I've
found out all I <emph>shall</emph> find out, I suppose. Mac-
kinnon &amp; Simpson as own the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good Fortune</name> tell
me there's a matter of a hundred and fifty
pounds due to poor Sam, which they'll pay over
to the proper parties. Not as I'm one of the
parties, my dear. I'm not an executor, it seems,
as Sam died detestate. And so if nobody don't
turn up all his money'll go to Queen Victoria,
which seems rum, don't it, seeing that she's got
more than she knows what to do with.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, well, John,</said> returned the blind woman,
bustling about with wonderful activity and never
making a mistake as to where anything was,
<said>come and have some dinner. You must be
hungry after your walk, and you can tell me
afterwards.</said></p>
<p>But it was very clear that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's dinner
did not take his attention away from the errand
which had sent him out that morning. Scarcely
had he swallowed half-a-dozen mouthfuls before
he began talking again.</p>
<p><said>Didn't Sam have a sister somewhere in the
country?</said> said he, looking up at his wife.</p>
<p><said>Yes, I think he had. Where was it now she
lived? Oh, I remember; it was at Lincoln.</said></p>
<p><said>You've got a good memory, old woman, and
no mistake. It was at Lincoln sure enough. Well,
I was thinking as I'd run down and see her about
this property of poor Sam's. Besides, she might
<pb n="55"/>
<fw><q>A Good Think.</q></fw>
know something of this boy as Sam left behind.
If the youngster can't be found I suppose the
money would belong to her; that's how the law
stands. I don't fancy though as she'd want that
there bit o' iron,</said> pointing with his fork to the
cannon-ball, which had been carefully placed on
the top of a small cupboard in a recess near the
fire-place. <said>I should like to keep that in memory
of poor Sam. And talking of that puts me in
mind of something. That Yankee mate and that
yellow-faced Chineyman are both gone.</said></p>
<p><said>Gone!</said> exclaimed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby; <said>gone
where?</said></p>
<p><said>How should I know? That's what they tells
me at Mackinnon &amp; Simpson's. Lampard, the
mate, drew his money the day after I brought
that cannon-ball home, and ain't been seen since,
nor the Chineyman either. It's nigh upon a week
ago now.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, it doesn't matter,</said> said the blind woman
quietly. <said>You don't want to see them, I sup-
pose.</said></p>
<p><said>Not I.</said></p>
<p>And having unburthened himself of all he had
to say, Jack attacked his dinner with great vig-
our, and having finished, lighted his pipe and
drew near the fire to have what he called a <soCalled>good
think.</soCalled></p>
<p>The room was cosy and the fire bright and
cheerful, and enjoying its pleasant warmth <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
<pb n="56"/>
<fw><q>A Poor Man Out o' Work.</q></fw>
Grigsby began first to get drowsy, and finally
dropped into a doze. Whether it was the dinner
he had eaten or the uncomfortable position in
which he was sitting, with his head resting on his
chest, we are unable to say, but somehow his sleep
was a troubled one. He snorted, he grumbled, he
groaned, and at last woke with a start, blinking
and rubbing his eyes.</p>
<p><said>I must ha' been a-dreaming,</said> he muttered;
<said>but I could ha' sworn as that Yankee fellow was
arter me again, and was a-trying to make me
swallow that there cannon-ball. It was thinking
about it as set me off, I suppose.</said></p>
<p>And he got up, stretched himself, yawned, took
one or two turns about the room, and finally sat
down in his chair once more. He was refilling
his pipe when there came a single knock at the
street door.</p>
<p>Thinking it was Ned and Nellie, who had gone
some distance on an errand, he rose hastily and
went to the door. On the step was standing a
shabbily dressed, dirty-faced man with a shifty
look in his small twinkling eyes, which seemed to
be afraid to meet Jack Grigsby's open, manly
gaze. His dress was all rags and tatters, and
the greasy cap on his head and the dirty com-
forter round his neck, coming up half over his
chin, made him look peculiarly repulsive.</p>
<p><said>Would you be so kind, sir, as to help a poor
man out o' work,</said> said the fellow, raising his
<pb n="57"/>
<fw>An Impudent Beggar.</fw>
shoulders almost as high as his ears, and rubbing
his red, bony hands one over the other as though
he were perishing with cold.</p>
<p><said>Out o' work,</said> repeated <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby suspi-
ciously; <said>what's your trade?</said></p>
<p><said>A carpenter, sir. The times are bad for such
as us, sir. I ain't tasted food to-day, sir.</said></p>
<p><said aloud="false">I don't believe you. You look as much like
a carpenter as I do,</said> thought the pilot. <said>Oh,
you're hungry, are you?</said> said he aloud.</p>
<p><said>Pretty nigh starved, sir,</said> replied the man.</p>
<p><said>Well, we'll soon cure that. Hannah!</said> he called
out going towards the kitchen. <said>Hannah! bring
a slice of bread and meat with you—a good thick
slice, mind.</said></p>
<p>When he turned round towards the beggar
again the latter had come two or three steps in
the passage, and stood very near the parlour door,
which was wide open.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">That's mighty impudent,</said> thought <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigs-
by.</p>
<p><said>I beg your pardon, sir, for being so bold,</said>
said the man, guessing, as it were, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's
thoughts. <said>But I was that chilly and froze, sir,
I couldn't help a-coming into the warmth.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby said nothing, but simply stood
with his hands in his pockets indulging in a low
whistle.</p>
<p>Hannah soon had the slice of bread and meat
ready, and the beggar took it from her with a
<pb n="58"/>
<fw><q>I Wish I'd Seen His Face.</q></fw>
great show of gratitude, but for a starving man
he showed great command over himself, for he
did not attempt to eat—although <emph>that</emph> might have
been his delicacy in the presence of his benefactor.</p>
<p>Holding the sandwich in his hand he shuffled
out, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby closed the door upon him.</p>
<p>Now it so happened that the beggar had
scarcely got a dozen yards away before Ned and
Nellie came tripping along, absorbed in an invest-
ment of hardbake which they had just made.</p>
<p><said>What a waste,</said> exclaimed Nellie; <said>did you
see what that man did?</said></p>
<p><said>Which man?</said> returned Ned, who, immersed
in hardbake, a far rarer treat to him than to
Nellie, had not noticed the beggar.</p>
<p><said>There—he's just passed us. I saw him throw
some bread and meat in the road. He can't be
very hungry, can he?</said></p>
<p>Ned did not answer, for with his mouth full of
the sweet stuff, he was engaged in staring at the
man, something in whose appearance had strangely
attracted him. He had a peculiar walk had this
beggar, just as though one leg was longer than
the other and he had to drag it after him.</p>
<p><said>What's the matter?</said> asked Nellie. <said>What
are you looking at?</said></p>
<p>Still Ned did not reply, but stood looking after
the man, who was tramping briskly away.</p>
<p><said>I wish I'd seen his face?</said> at last exclaimed
the boy.</p>
<pb n="59"/>
<fw>Jack Grigsby Made a Fool Of.</fw>
<p><said>Well, it wasn't a very handsome one,</said> re-
turned Nellie laughing; <said>and so dirty.</said> She
was going to add, <said>almost as dirty as yours when
you first came to live with us,</said> when she checked
herself, for there seemed to be something unkind
about the expression.</p>
<p><said>What was it like?</said> said Ned almost thought-
fully.</p>
<p><said>What was it like?</said> repeated Nellie, vainly
trying to recall the man's features. <said>It was like
—it was like—well, nearly as ugly as the old
Admiral in our garden.</said></p>
<p>Ned shook his head. The comparison did not
at all assist him, for he could not imagine a
human being who could in any way resemble
that unfortunate seaman.</p>
<p>He walked slowly to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's gate with
his hands in his pockets—a new luxury for him
who but a week ago had his trousers pockets
under his armpits—but said no more. Nellie,
full of the dreadful waste of which the man had
been guilty, ran on in front to express her opinion
on the subject to her grandmother, who had on
several former occasions impressed her with the
necessity of being careful over everything.</p>
<p><said>What, my lass?</said> exclaimed Jack when the
little girl had enlarged upon the incident with
considerable embellishments, after the manner of
childhood. <said>Threw his dinner away? Then all
I got to say is, he's made a fool of old Jack
<pb n="60"/>
<fw>Ned Begins to be a Scholar.</fw>
Grigsby. That bread and meat came from this
house, Nell. I knew that fellow was no good
directly I set eyes on him. But there, I suppose
it's human natur' to be taken in by them land
sharks as is too lazy to work, and so we'll say no
more about it.</said></p>
<p>And accordingly no more <emph>was</emph> said about it,
though Ned would have liked more, for he had a
curious idea on the subject which he wanted to
have settled to his satisfaction.</p>
<p><said>I should like to see that chap once more,</said>
was his reflection. <said>Perhaps he may come down
the street again. Anyhow I'll keep a good look-
out.</said></p>
<p>But this resolution he kept to himself, and not
a word of it said he to anybody.</p>
<p>The days went on, and Ned gradually became
more and more a part of the Grigsby household.
The first thing the good pilot charged himself with
was sending the lad to school, where his natural
wit and sharpness stood him in good stead, for
though he was behind most of the other lads of
his age in book learning, he began to catch up to
them with wonderful quickness. What gave him
the most trouble was to get out of the street pro-
nunciation of several words. In school he was
able to steer clear of the pitfalls which beset him,
because not only was he naturally more careful,
but he had very little to say aloud except his les-
sons, and in learning these his faults had been
<pb n="61"/>
<fw>Long Smith's Trick.</fw>
corrected by Nellie, who was a most exacting little
taskmistress, and delighted in domineering over
him and in showing off her superior intelligence.</p>
<p>But in play-hours and when he got excited he
was continually making slips, much to the scorn
of the others—especially one gentleman who
rejoiced in the name of Long Smith, so called on
account of his stature, he being at least half a
head taller than any other boy in the school,
though he was by no means the oldest.</p>
<p>Long Smith took a pleasure in making Ned
ridiculous, and sometimes, though not often, suc-
ceeded, for Ned was quick enough to see through
the traps laid for him. One day a reading-class
was called up. The book selected was an old-
fashioned <soCalled>Speaker.</soCalled> <soCalled>Speakers</soCalled> have long
been superseded in the present enlightened times,
but in the days I am writing of Enfield's <title>Speaker</title>
and Blair's <title>Class Book</title> were the standard reading
books.</p>
<p>The class had already taken up its position, but
Ned had his head buried in his desk, tumbling
his books right and left.</p>
<p><said>Come along, Griggy,</said> whispered Long Smith
as he passed.</p>
<p><said>But I can't find my Speaker. Somebody's
taken it. Have you, Smith?</said></p>
<p><said><emph>I</emph> take your Speaker!</said> replied Smith with
great loftiness; <said>why should I take yours when
I've one of my own? Here, have this. It's an
<pb n="62"/>
<fw>The Long S's.</fw>
old copy of Addison's <title>Spectator</title>, but it's got what
we're going to read to-day—<q>The Vision of
Mirza.</q></said></p>
<p>And as he spoke he thrust a dirty, discoloured,
dog's-eared book without a cover into Ned's
hands. Ned glanced at the open page, saw it was
the <q>Vision of Mirza,</q> and hurried up to take his
position.</p>
<p>The method of reading adopted was for each
boy to read about twenty lines or so, and when it
came to Ned's turn he began after a little hesita-
tion in the following fashion: <said>I had been often
told that the Rock before me was the haunt of a
Genius, and that sev— feveral had been enter-
tained with Mufick who had paffed by it.</said></p>
<p>Here came in a giggle and a splutter from the
top of the class.</p>
<p>Ned continued undaunted: <said>but never heard
that the Mufician had before made himfelf visible.</said></p>
<p>The giggle was here more pronounced, and the
master looked up severely to see what was the
matter.</p>
<p><said>Silence!</said> he proclaimed. <said>You can go on,
Grigsby.</said></p>
<p>And Grigsby did go on, but only to get
further confused among the terrible long s's, for
it was a very ancient edition which the crafty
Smith had poked into Ned's hands, and the lad,
not knowing the peculiarities of old printing, had
pronounced all the long s's as f's.</p>
<pb n="63"/>
<fw>Ned Challenges His Adversary,</fw>
<p>It was not a very great matter, and Ned would
have thought nothing of it had it been accidental.
But when Long Smith, with a grin on his large
mouth, afterwards presented him with his lost
<soCalled>Speaker,</soCalled> produced from behind a box, he was
naturally angered. However he did not say much,
which prompted <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Smith to remark that he
<emph>was</emph> a <soCalled>green 'un</soCalled> to be made such a fool of.</p>
<p><said>Any one could take you in, Griggy, I believe,</said>
he further observed in a contemptuous tone.</p>
<p><said>Could they?</said> was all Ned deigned to reply.</p>
<p>And failing to make the boy lose his temper,
and a geography class being called, Long Smith
hurried away, but with the determination of
making the incident a standing dish of ridicule.</p>
<p>Going home that day Long Smith was as good
as his word, and this merry young gentleman
began to mimic Ned's reading that day as he
walked behind him.</p>
<p>Ned turned sharply round and faced his tor-
mentor.</p>
<p><said>Look here, Long Smith. If I put up with your
silliness <emph>in</emph> school I don't <emph>out.</emph> Understand that.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, lor', what a swell we are! Anything else,
Griggy?</said></p>
<p><said>No, 'ceptin' if you don't know how to behave
yourself I'll give you a lesson. I ain't a-going to
stand any of your nonsense.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, ain't yer a-going, ain't yer?</said> mocking his
pronunciation.</p>
<pb n="64"/>
<fw>and is Victorious.</fw>
<p>Ned flushed a bright scarlet, stepped a little on
one side towards a bye street, and beckoned to
Long Smith to follow him.</p>
<p>There were half a dozen of the other boys
witnesses of the scene, and Long Smith could not
refuse. He walked behind Ned for some little
distance down the street, though in by no means
so heroic an attitude as distinguished him two
minutes since.</p>
<p>Arrived at what he considered a suitable spot,
Ned stopped and took off his jacket.</p>
<p><said>Look here, Long Smith, I'm going to fight
you, so I give you fair warning.</said></p>
<p>Long Smith looked by no means pleased at the
intimation, but a head and shoulders as he was
above Ned he felt pretty certain of coming off the
victor.</p>
<p><said>Why, you young fool,</said> he stammered, <said>I
shall smash you.</said></p>
<p><said>Very well, smash me; only don't keep me
waiting here all day.</said></p>
<p>Upon which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Smith took off <emph>his</emph> jacket,
using great deliberation so that if Ned wished to
alter his mind about being smashed he should
have ample opportunity.</p>
<p>But Ned showed no disposition to avail himself
of this merciful consideration, and at last Long
Smith threw himself into position, appearing by
the side of Ned's slim form quite a giant. It was
soon evident that Ned was anxious to court his
<pb n="65"/>
<fw>A Reputation Gained.</fw>
smashing rather than avoid it, and dexterously
slipping in between Smith's long arms, which were
going about wildly like the sails of a windmill,
his hard fist came suddenly close to Long Smith's
nose, with the result that that young gentleman
stopped plunging with his arms and put his hands
to his nose as demanding more immediate atten-
tion. Once begun, however, Ned showed no signs
of leaving off, and half a dozen smart blows struck
upwards seemed to indicate that instead of being
smashed he was going to be the smasher.</p>
<p>It was evident that Long Smith's forte was not
fighting, for although he was not hurt very much
he showed the white feather most distinctly, and
cried out for quarter.</p>
<p><said>Do you beg my pardon?</said> demanded Ned.</p>
<p><said>Yes, of course I do, Grigsby,</said> bellowed the
tall youth.</p>
<p><said>All right, then; shake hands and we'll say no
more about it.</said></p>
<p>With which request the fallen giant complied,
though somewhat ruefully it must be confessed.</p>
<p>This little encounter quite established Ned's
reputation, and made a marked difference in the
respect which was paid him by the other boys.</p>

<head type="main">In Search of the Skipper's Son</head>

<p>Time went on, and owing to various
delays very little progress was made
in tracing out Captain Somerset's lost
son. First of all Jack Grigsby met with an ac-
cident on board a ship he was piloting down to
Gravesend. A block, which you know is the
nautical term for a pulley, owing to a rope sud-
denly breaking, fell upon his foot, and he was
obliged to stop at home for quite a month. He
was obliged, therefore, to put off his visit to Lin-
coln in search of Sam Somerset's sister, and so
what with one thing and another, he did not start
upon the expedition he had promised himself until
nearly two months after Ned had been at school.</p>
<p>But now he had made up his mind that the
task should be set about seriously. Christmas
had come and gone; his foot was nearly well, and
he was able to walk without leaning so heavily
on his stick.</p>
<p><said>If you get one or two things ready for me,
<pb n="67"/>
<fw>Grigsby goes to Lincoln.</fw>
old woman,</said> said he, <said>I think I'll start next
week. I may have to stay a day or two, so don't
be surprised if you has a line by post from me
instead of myself coming in at that there door.</said></p>
<p><said>Do you know, John,</said> said the blind woman
thoughtfully, <said>I don't think you'll get much good
out of this journey. I remember Sam's sister
well—a very stern, hard woman she was. They
never got on well together—always daggers drawn
—and I fancy Sam wouldn't ask her advice about
his boy and tell her anything of his affairs.</said></p>
<p><said>I don't know but what you're right. Sam
was always a rum 'un. Close as wax, that he was.
Never let his right hand know what his left hand
was doing. Still blood's thicker than water, and
he might ha' written her a letter or something.
Anyway I sha'n't do no harm, 'specially as she
ought to know for her own sake.</said></p>
<p>And so one bright morning in February saw
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby get into a cab which took him to the
Great Northern Railway station at King's Cross.
Here he took a ticket for Lincoln, and in half an
hour's time was speeding down to this quiet old
English cathedral city.</p>
<p>When, after the usual amount of jolting, of
stopping at stations—the names of which he tried
to make out but couldn't, owing to the queer pro-
nunciation of the porters—of whistling, shrieking,
and snorting on the part of the engines, he got
out, weary and stiff, at his destination, he was a
<pb n="68"/>
<fw>He Looks About Him.</fw>
little bit puzzled what to do next. He first found
his way into the High Street, which was easy
enough, for Lincoln is all High Street, one end
leading by a steep approach up to the cathedral,
the other stretching away with the shops melting
into private houses, the houses into cottages into
the flat country beyond. Having got into the
High Street he strolled to the right, being at-
tracted, as all strangers naturally are, by the high
square tower of the cathedral. When he came to
the ancient one-arched bridge over the river
Witham he stopped for a moment and looked at the
dark sluggish narrow stream running beneath and
the houses built on each side of the water, and then
went on again, nearing the cathedral at every step,
and beginning to puff and blow, for the ascent, as
we have said, was steep, and climbing hills does
not suit stout short-necked men at sixty years old
or thereabouts.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">A glass of ale and a bit of something to eat
wouldn't be bad,</said> he thought, as he passed an
inviting-looking inn of the old-fashioned kind,
with its diamond-paned windows and low door-
way, on which a signboard creaked with a lazy
moan which assorted well with the generally lazy
and easy-going air of the city itself.</p>
<p>And as he was in no hurry he determined to
have some dinner before he went a step further,
so he walked into the sanded parlour, ordered
some ale of the buxom landlady, and inquired if
<pb n="69"/>
<fw>The <q>Rose and Crown.</q></fw>
he could have a chop. <said>Yes, he could,</said> said the
landlady, <said>if he liked to wait while it was pur-
chased.</said> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby had no objection, and feel-
ing in a very comfortable state of mind after a
draught of ale, sat down on a settle by the win-
dow and watched the good people of Lincoln, or
at least those of them whose business took them
past the <q>Rose and Crown.</q></p>
<p>The traffic certainly was not great, one reason
being that the cathedral end of the city was the
genteel end, and had that repose about it which
the very presence of a cathedral seems to impart.
Another reason was that it was between one and
two o'clock, at which time most people in the
country are having their dinners.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the small number of persons
who went by the window that made Jack Grigsby
take more notice of them than he otherwise would
have done. One woman in particular he was
struck with. She was of a tall, upright figure,
and was dressed in deep mourning, the sombre-
ness of her attire making her rigid, square features
seem more gloomy than they really were. She
wore her black shawl pulled tightly over her
shoulders and walked with her hands clasped in
front of her, her elbows standing out square and
uncompromising. By the lines in her face she was
certainly not less than 50 years of age.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">I shouldn't like to have to ask a favour of <emph>you</emph>,
ma'am,</said> was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's reflection, <said aloud="false">because I
<pb n="70"/>
<fw>Jim's Recollections.</fw>
think the chances are you wouldn't grant it. I'm
blest if yon sour face hasn't taken away my ap-
petite.</said></p>
<p>But this wasn't exactly correct, as the appear-
ance of two chop bones half an hour hence plainly
showed. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby did justice to his dinner,
and feeling greatly fortified therewith, commenced
in earnest his quest after Sam's sister.</p>
<p><said>Do you know a Miss Somerset living in this
city,</said> he asked of the buxom landlady.</p>
<p><said>Somerset—Somerset!</said> repeated the landlady;
<said>there used to be a family o' that name who
kept a farm about six miles from Lincoln. The
son was a bit wild and went to sea, so I heard.</said></p>
<p><said>You've hit it, ma'am. Sam <emph>was</emph> wild, there's
no mistake about it. He was a shipmate o'
mine, ma'am, thirty years ago, though he was
quite a boy at the time, and I was second mate.
And what's become of his sister?</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, I fancy she's living in Lincoln somewhere,
but her name isn't Somerset now. She married
years and years ago, and her husband's dead.</said></p>
<p><said>Aye, aye. And what was her husband's
name?</said></p>
<p><said>Ah! that I can't tell you, though I've heard
it. But my man, Jim, 'll know. Jim!</said> she called
out.</p>
<p>Presently a weazen-faced old man, in a shabby
velveteen coat, knee-breeches, and gray stockings,
with a few loose straws sticking in his hair as if
<pb n="71"/>
<fw>Fishing for Information.</fw>
he usually made his bed in a stable loft, came
shuffling into the bar from a back room.</p>
<p><said>Who did Dorcas Somerset marry? This gentle-
man wants to know.</said></p>
<p><said>I was ploughman to Farmer Somerset five-
and-forty year agone,</said> returned the old man,
putting his hand to his head as though to assist
his memory, <said>and well I remember young Sam
Somerset running away to sea, and Miss Dorcas
getting married. It was gay doings, sir, though
the marriage turned out badly. Her husband
runned through all her money and his own too in
less than no time, and went into a gallopin' 'sump-
tion as took him off, and she was left a widder,
sir, with a boy as when he growed up took arter
his father.</said></p>
<p><said>Consumption do run in families,</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Grigsby.</p>
<p><said>Oh, I don't mean as young Bob Locket got
'sumption. Not he. It 'ud ha' been a good thing
p'raps if he had. Would ha' broken his mother's
heart if she hadn't been a stout 'un like all the
Somersets. Got hold of bad ways did Bob Locket,
sir, and turned out a regilar riprobate.</said></p>
<p><said>Then Locket is Miss Somerset's name, is it?</said>
said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, to whom all this was news.</p>
<p><said>Locket's her name, sir, sure enough. If you
know'd her years ago you'd find her a bit
changed. Sorrer don't brighten up a woman's
face.</said></p>
<pb n="72"/>
<fw>Grigsby Calls on the Grim Lady.</fw>
<p><said>You ain't far out, skipper, in them sentiments,</said>
replied Jack. <said>And now since you've told me so
much I shouldn't wonder if you couldn't tell me
a bit more. Where's <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Locket a living, eh?</said></p>
<p><said>Down the other end of the street. An old
ramshackled place it is, sir, about half a mile or
so past the railway. You can't mistake the house.
Said to be a bit of the old abbey, sir. But any-
body knows <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Locket down there.</said></p>
<p><said>All right, captain, I shall find it. I ain't with-
out a tongue in my head.</said></p>
<p>And giving the old man a sixpence for his in-
formation, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby started off to retrace his
steps and to find out <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Locket.</p>
<p>As old Jim had said it was a very ancient
house in which Sam's sister lived. Just a frag-
ment of old gray stone, cunningly jammed in be-
tween modern houses, with one lancet-shaped
window stuck oddly above the doorway, to which
(the door, not the window) you ascended by three
steps that appeared to be cut in the wall itself,
which could not have been less than three feet
thick.</p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby ascended the three steps and gave
a modest knock at the door. It was opened
almost immediately, and the hard-featured woman
who had attracted his attention an hour before
stood before him.</p>
<p><said>What do you want?</said> said she in a cross voice.</p>
<p>Jack Grigsby was so taken aback by the unex-
<pb n="73"/>
<fw>Five Minutes' Talk.</fw>
pected appearance of the woman that at first he
could not reply. However, in a little while he
recovered himself sufficiently to inquire of the
woman whether her name was Locket.</p>
<p><said>Yes, it is. What is your business?</said></p>
<p><said>Well, ma'am, if you've got time, I should like
five minutes' talk with you.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Locket looked at him suspiciously, as if
wondering whether he might be safely trusted
inside her house, and then said coldly, <said>You may
come in.</said></p>
<p>And accordingly Jack Grigsby went in, to find
that the door opened directly upon a moderately-
sized room poorly furnished. It was lighted from
a window at the back, and in the corner was a
staircase leading to the room above. The inside
of the house did not at all correspond with the
outside as to antiquity, and in all probability the
fragment of the old abbey wall had been simply
used by a modern builder to attach a couple of
rooms to, as being cheaper and less troublesome
than picking to pieces and pulling down the solid
masonry, which the old monks knew so well how
to build.</p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby deposited his hat on the floor,
mopped his head with his handkerchief, and sat
down opposite <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Locket, who, square and
grim, awaited standing what her visitor had to
say.</p>
<p><said>I'm not much at spinning a long yarn, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
<pb n="74"/>
<fw>Where is Sam Somerset's Boy?</fw>
Locket, so I'll come to the p'int at once. My
name's Grigsby, Jack Grigsby, and I'm an old
friend of your brother, Captain Sam Somerset.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Locket nodded, as much as to say, <said>I've
heard of you; go on.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, ma'am, fearing as you may not have
heard the news of poor Sam's death—</said></p>
<p><said>What!</said> she broke in, <said>is Sam dead?</said></p>
<p><said>Aye that he is. And it's that as has brought
me down here. It's now getting on for three
months. I was with him when he died, and just
as he was a going he told me as all he had in the
world was to go to his son. That seems plain and
easy enough, don't it? But it ain't. Not a bit
of it; 'cause I can't find the boy, and you being
the nighest relation as Sam had, I thought I'd see
whether you knew where he was.</said></p>
<p><said>If you'd come to me six years ago I might
have told you, but I know nothing about him
now,</said> returned <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Locket.</p>
<p><said>That's mighty strange, ain't it? You'll ex-
cuse me asking the question; but who might Sam
have left the boy with when he went away?</said></p>
<p><said>He was left with me—that is in my charge.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby thought she was going to say some-
thing else, and he waited, but she was silent.</p>
<p><said>He's not,</said> observed the old pilot slowly,
<said>—dead.</said></p>
<p><said>I don't know. He may be. I don't suppose
I should have heard of it though, if he was.</said></p>
<pb n="75"/>
<fw>A Bad Son.</fw>
<p>Jack Grigsby was more and more mystified.
At last he said, with a kind of desperation:</p>
<p><said>Well, ma'am, the boy's your kith and kin and
not mine. It's your dooty to look after him and
not mine. I've told you what I've come about,
and how as your brother Sam has left a bit of
money and a piece of old iron as ain't of no value
at all, to his son, and I should be glad to know
what you're a going to do.</said></p>
<p><said>Did <emph>you</emph> ever have a son, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby?</said></p>
<p><said>No,</said> remarked Jack, <said>I can't say as I ever
have.</said></p>
<p><said>You are fortunate. Mine has been nothing
but a trouble to me since the day he was born.
I've worked and slaved for him and had nothing
but ingratitude in return. I never hear from him
excepting when he wants some money, and though
I can ill spare it, I have always shared whatever
I have with him. But I suppose you wonder
why I tell you this?</said></p>
<p>Yes, Jack did wonder, for he could not under-
stand what it had to do with Captain Somerset's
son.</p>
<p><said>I tell it to you because it is all through my
son Robert that I can give you no information
about my nephew. When my brother went away
eight years ago, his son Edward—</said></p>
<p><said>Edward!</said> ejaculated <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby.</p>
<p><said>Yes, that was the boy's name—was two years
old. I didn't care to be bothered with children,
<pb n="76"/>
<fw>A Dark Suspicion.</fw>
and I let my son Bob and his wife take care of
him, especially as his father had promised to pay
well for his keep. Well, Sam sent some money
six months after he went away, and from that
day to this not another word was heard from him.
When the boy should have been five years old
Bob sends me word that Edward went out to
play down by the river side at low water, and
never comes home. My son made all inquiry, but
could find no tidings of the lad, and wrote to me
he thought he was drowned.</said></p>
<p><said>And do you believe it, ma'am?</said> asked <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Grigsby.</p>
<p><said>No, I don't,</said> answered <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Locket shortly.
<said>It's a hard thing to say about my own son, but
my belief is that as Sam sent no more money he
turned the boy out of doors. He's capable of it.</said></p>
<p><said>Then all I've got to say, though he <emph>is</emph> your
son, is that he deserves to have a round dozen,</said>
exclaimed Jack with honest indignation. <said>But
what makes you think the boy was turned out
of doors?</said></p>
<p><said>I taxed Ann, his wife, with it one day, and
she half admitted I was right.</said></p>
<p><said>And where does this precious son of yours live?</said></p>
<p><said>I don't know.</said></p>
<p><said>Where <emph>did</emph> he live when the boy was with
him?</said></p>
<p><said>In the south of London—Rotherhithe, I think
it was.</said></p>
<pb n="77"/>
<fw>Grigsby Begins to See Land.</fw>
<p><said>Well, ma'am, I give you notice I shall do my
best to find poor Sam's child, and if there's any
way of punishing the rascal who—</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby stopped, suddenly remembering
that the man he called a rascal was the son of the
woman he was talking to; but she heard him
unmoved, and he finished up the sentence by
saying, <said>I'll do it.</said></p>
<p><said>There's one thing more I've got to say to you,
ma'am,</said> went on Jack, picking up his hat, pre-
paratory to taking his leave, <said>and it's this. If
the boy can't be found all the money that should
be his comes to you as next of kin.</said></p>
<p><said>And I trust it never may. It will do <emph>me</emph> no
good. I have just enough to live on, and the
more I have the more I shall have to give away,</said>
returned the woman gloomily.</p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby understood her. He knew she
referred to her son Bob.</p>
<p>He said no more, but, bidding her adieu, went
out and was once more in the High Street of
Lincoln, up which he walked very slowly and
very thoughtfully to the railway-station.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">It's a rum coin-ci-dence, if it ain't no more,</said>
he thought. <said aloud="false">Sam's boy is named Edward and
<emph>my</emph> boy's named Ned. What d'ye make o' that,
Jack Grigsby? Sam's boy is cast adrift some-
where nigh the river. Mine's picked up nigh the
river. T'other side, it's true, but what o' that?
It's a coin-cidence.</said></p>
<pb n="78"/>
<fw>Ned Disappears,</fw>
<p>And <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby was so full of the <soCalled>coin-
cidence</soCalled> he walked slower and slower, with the
result that when he arrived at the station he
found the London train had just gone, and that
there was not another one until late in the evening.</p>
<p><said>I sha'n't get home afore midnight, and every-
body will have gone to bed. I'd better stop and
go in the morning.</said></p>
<p>And so he did. He went back to the <q>Rose and
Crown,</q> engaged a bed, and started for town the
next day, arriving at King's Cross about noon.</p>
<p>As he neared his house he saw the face of his
granddaughter at the window.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">There's my Nell,</said> he thought, <said aloud="false">watching for
me, bless her heart.</said></p>
<p>Nell did not wait for her grandfather to come
up to the house, but ran out to meet him.</p>
<p><said>Oh, grandfather!</said> she cried. <said>Ned—Ned—</said></p>
<p>And she burst into a flood of tears.</p>
<p><said>Eh, what—what? Nellie, my deary, what's
the matter?</said></p>
<p>But <q>Ned</q> was all he could distinguish amid
her sobs.</p>
<p>He took her hand and they went together into
the house. His wife met him in the passage
and he saw from her face that something was
wrong.</p>
<p><said>My dear John,</said> said the blind woman, <said>a
strange—a sad thing has happened. Ned has
gone.</said></p>
<pb n="79"/>
<fw>and Does Not Come Back.</fw>
<p><said>Gone!</said> exclaimed Jack Grigsby. <said>What do
you mean, old lady?</said></p>
<p><said>He has disappeared. He went to school yes-
terday afternoon as usual, but has never come
home.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, and I'm sure something has hap—hap—
hap—pened to him,</said> sobbed Nellie. <said>He wouldn't
g—g—go away without saying goo—goo—good-
bye to me.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby was dumfoundered. He couldn't
say a word. Still holding his granddaughter's
hand he walked into the little parlour and sat
down dejectedly in the arm-chair.</p>
<p><said>Well I never!</said> at last he ejaculated. <said>This
is the most knockdownest blow as ever I had.</said></p>
<p><said>When he didn't come home for two hours
after school was over I sent Ann to see whether he
had been kept in,</said> continued <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby. <said>But
no, it seems he left school at the right time, and
said good-night at the comer of the street to one
of the boys who came home with him, and that's
all we can find out.</said></p>
<p>And that indeed was all. The police were in-
formed, inquiries were made at the hospitals lest
he had met with an accident, the old pilot rambled
up and down the streets of Shadwell, thinking he
might chance to come across the boy in some of
his old haunts; but no, the days went by and
Ned did not come back.</p>

only seen by the river side. These men are given
much to lounging on the object nearest to hand,
whether it may be the bar of the <q>Jolly Water-
man</q> (and very often it is), the dirty wooden
wainscotting on the side of the passage leading to
the bow-windowed room before spoken of, or the
empty casks which are conveniently placed near
the low ill-shaped door. The landlord of the
<q>Jolly Waterman</q> is very friendly with the
rough men who lounge in and out all day, and is
as often one of the loungers as not, leaving to his
wife—a pale-faced woman, with a manner about
her as if she were continually afraid of something
—the duty of attending to business.</p>
<p>But to-night the landlord, Bob Locket, as he is
familiarly called, is not in the bar. He is in the
room with the bow-window, sitting by the side
of a rough wooden table on which is a tallow
candle, burning dimly, and a couple of glasses,
while on the other side is a gentleman whom we
have met before—Hosea Lampard, once mate of
the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good Fortune</name>.</p>
<p><said>You see, captain, you couldn't have got on
without me after all,</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket.</p>
<p><said>I don't know about that, sir. I'm pretty spry
when I take a thing in my head,</said> replied the
American, who seemed to be in an ill humour.</p>
<p><said>Oh, you're quite right there, captain; quite
right,</said> hastily rejoined the other, evidently anxious
to keep him in a good temper. <said>But then, you
<pb n="82"/>
<fw>Honour Amongst Thieves.</fw>
know, you dursn't show yourself. That's where
it is, you see. Now I goes along to the old
fellow's house, pretends to be a beggar, and get
a good look inside the room where it is.</said></p>
<p><said>But what I say is this: there's too many in
it.</said></p>
<p><said>There now, how unreasonable you are, cap-
tain. Look here, just see how it lies. A sea-
faring chap comes promiscous to the <q>Jolly Water-
man,</q> and lets out how Captain Somerset's home-
ward bound, and dies just when he's coming into
port. Well, I can't help that, can I? You see it
was known to more than you and that Chinaman,
and I wasn't to blame for using my information,
was I?</said></p>
<p>The American was by no means satisfied with
the explanation. He only shifted his legs, which
were resting on the window-sill, and puffed a huge
cloud of smoke from between his lips.</p>
<p><said>Besides, you know, I <emph>was</emph> useful,</said> continued
the landlord of the <q>Jolly Waterman,</q> darting a
cunning look at the Yankee. <said>If there's one too
many it's the Chinaman, not me, who's in the way.</said></p>
<p><said>You won't get rid of him in a hurry, I reckon.
Ah Ling Foo's cut his wise teeth long ago, don't
you make any mistake about <emph>that</emph>. If that little
rascal hadn't come in our way I shouldn't have
wanted the pleasure of <emph>your</emph> acquaintance, Bob
Locket, and that's a fact. Wa'al, it's no use
growling over what can't be helped, only mind

<fw><q>The Lodger</q> at the <q>Jolly Waterman.</q></fw>
you this, stranger, don't you play me false. We've
got an ugly way of showing our temper in the
States when we're riled.</said></p>
<p><said>You may trust in me, captain, as you would
in your own brother.</said></p>
<p><said>That ain't saying much,</said> grumbled the <soCalled>cap-
tain;</soCalled> <said>for I wouldn't trust him with half-a-
dollar and be sartin of seeing it again.</said></p>
<p>He paused a moment to puff at his cigar and
then said: <said>Have you got anything more to say
to me?</said></p>
<p><said>No, I don't think so,</said> returned the landlord
doubtfully. <said>We've settled upon the night, and
that's the most important thing, I suppose.</said></p>
<p>The <soCalled>captain</soCalled> slowly swung his feet off the
window-sill on to the ground, and as slowly rose
from his feet.</p>
<p><said>Then it's a bargain,</said> said he.</p>
<p><said>A bargain,</said> repeated the other.</p>
<p>The landlord accompanied his visitor to the
door and returned to the parlour.</p>
<p><said>It shall go hard but what I'll have the best
of the bargain,</said> he muttered, a smile, and a very
ugly smile it was too, flitting over his face.
<said>Ann,</said> he called out in a loud voice.</p>
<p>The faded-looking woman put her head in at
the door.</p>
<p><said>Yes, Bob.</said></p>
<p><said>What about the—lodger?</said> asked the man,
with a jerk of his head upwards.</p>
<pb n="84"/>
<fw><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob Locket's Expedition.</fw>
<p><said>He's all right.</said></p>
<p><said>Mind he is, that's all,</said> returned <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket
scowling. <said>I'm going out to-night, and he's in
<emph>your</emph> charge, recollect that.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, Bob.</said></p>
<p><said>Here's the key—or stay. On second thoughts
I won't leave you the key. You're so precious
soft-hearted you might be tempted to let him give
us the slip. I'm not going to lose over a hundred
pounds just for <emph>your</emph> silliness.</said></p>
<p>The woman said nothing. She was too used
to be bullied, and even worse—struck, by her
husband, ever to argue or to question anything
he said.</p>
<p><said>And what time will you be home?</said></p>
<p><said>What's that to you? I can let myself in, I
suppose.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, I suppose so,</said> she returned drearily.</p>
<p>She waited in case he had anything more to
say, and finding he had not, disappeared behind
the bar.</p>
<p>By-and-by the clock of Limehouse Church
chimes the hour of eleven, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob Locket
puts on a rough fur cap with lappets on each
side, which he pulls down on his cheeks, ties
with a string under his chin, and goes out.</p>
<p>His wife sits in the bar for nearly ten minutes,
serves one customer, and after the latter has left
the house goes herself to the door and looks to the
right and left. There are very few people about,
<pb n="85"/>
<fw>Ned a Prisoner.</fw>
for it is a lonely narrow street in which the <q>Jolly
Waterman</q> is situated, and the buildings mostly
consist of ships' chandlers' (where you can buy
everything wanted on board ship, from a nail to
an anchor block,) and mast makers', and tar, pitch,
and rosin warehouses.</p>
<p>She stands in the doorway for two or three
minutes and then goes inside, pulls up the shut-
ters and screws them, and locks the door. Then
she ascends the narrow rickety staircase leading
to the top of the house. The staircase, which is
built in the very centre of the house between the
rooms, ends at a landing which, like the slope of
the house, inclines towards the river. The boards
have shrunk with age, and there are gaping cracks
between them. They creak and rattle as she
walks over them towards a ladder which is nailed
against a wall, and at the top of which is a small
door. This ladder she climbs, and then taps at
the door.</p>
<p><said>It is only me, Ned, dear.</said></p>
<p>There is the sound of a footstep within, and
the woman puts her ear to the crack in the door.</p>
<p><said>Won't you give me something to eat, Ann?
I'm so hungry.</said></p>
<p><said>Poor boy. I would, but I can't open the door.</said></p>
<p><said>Is that beast out?</said></p>
<p><said>You mean Bob?</said></p>
<p><said>Bob if you like; it used to be Phil. Not that
<emph>I</emph> care. I hate him whatever you call him.</said></p>
<pb n="86"/>
<fw>Next Door to Starvation.</fw>
<p><said>Yes, he has gone out and taken the key with
him,</said> said the woman tearfully.</p>
<p><said>Does he mean to starve me? <emph>You</emph> know I
haven't had a bit of anything all day. What's he
shut me up here for? What's it for, I say? I've
never done any harm to him, have I, Ann?</said></p>
<p><said>No, dear; no. He's very wicked. I can't say
any more than that. He was always bad, Ned,
and he gets worse as he gets older.</said></p>
<p><said>Six years ago he turns me out o' doors, and
now he collars me and shuts me up in this black
hole. Oh! if I could only get out I'd show him
as he can't do as he likes with me.</said></p>
<p>And the woman heard him grind his teeth and
stamp on the floor with passion. She waited
until he was calm again, and then passing her
hand along the bottom of the door said: <said>I think
there's room to slip a thin slice of bread and butter
underneath the door. How stupid of me not to
think of it before!</said></p>
<p>And without waiting for a reply she slipped
down the ladder and ran down-stairs to the
kitchen, where she cut half a dozen wafer-like
slices, and, brought them up again. One by one
she slipped them through the division between the
door and the floor of the room, for here, as every-
where else in the house, the wood had shrunk, and
though they arrived with a considerable addition
in the shape of dust, the boy seized them with
eagerness and devoured them ravenously.</p>
<pb n="87"/>
<fw>No Way Out of It.</fw>
<p>For a whole fortnight he had been imprisoned
in a miserable loft, without firing or covering save
a miserably tattered blanket. There were no
windows in this loft, and the only means he pos-
sessed of dividing day from night were through
the rays of light which came through the chinks
in the wooden roof. He had been miserably fed,
too, scarcely having had enough to eat to keep
body and soul together, and strong and wiry as
his outdoor life had made him, he felt he could
not endure this starvation diet much longer.</p>
<p>How like an ugly dream the whole thing
seemed! To go home from school whistling
cheerfully, and thinking of the bright pretty face
of Nellie awaiting him, to be suddenly seized
round the neck, to have something like a hand-
kerchief thrust in his mouth, and to be dragged
vainly struggling and thrust into a cab!—he could
scarcely realize it when he thought of it. Often
when the dismal reality <emph>did</emph> come home to him
the hot blinding tears ran down his cheeks, for
he knew what might be said of him at Gibraltar
cottage—that he had behaved with ingratitude,
and had run away to go back to his old life.</p>
<p>And then the old stubborn spirit of indepen-
dence came to his rescue and gave him fresh
courage. He would make his escape in spite of
his prison, and carefully he felt all over the roof
—for the distance from the floor at the highest
part was scarcely five feet—in search of a board
<pb n="88"/>
<fw>Ann Locket's Pity.</fw>
which might be loose or where the nails had
rusted. But, alas! the wood was both thick and
firm, and the nails were ship nails, made of cop-
per, and not likely to be affected by the weather.
And so in spite of his courage and his endeavours
his hopes began to fall when at the end of a fort-
night he still found himself shut up.</p>
<p>And besides, as it occurred to him in his de-
spondent moments, even supposing he was able to
make his way on to the roof, how could he get
down. He hoped that the houses adjoining might
be of the same height, so that if he crawled along
somebody might take pity on him; but these
houses might be much higher or much lower, and
in either case his efforts would be useless. And
again his hopes were dashed, and he went back
again to the dull, miserable thought that there
was some dreadful plot to keep him shut up for
years, and perhaps—who could tell?—starve him
to death.</p>
<p>The half-dozen slices, dirt and all, put him in a
little brighter frame of mind, and he no longer
had that terrible gnawing inside him which made
him feel faint and sick.</p>
<p><said>Ann,</said> he whispered, <said>do <emph>you</emph> hate me like <emph>he</emph>
does.</said></p>
<p>The boy could never bring himself to call Bob
Locket by his name.</p>
<p><said>You know, dear, I do not.</said></p>
<p><said>You don't want to keep me here?</said> he said again.</p>
<pb n="89"/>
<fw>The Kidnappers.</fw>
<p><said>Heaven knows I do not.</said></p>
<p><said>Then for pity's sake let me out. I promise
you I won't say a word against <emph>him</emph> to get him
into trouble. I'll forget all about it. I will in-
deed.</said></p>
<p><said>My poor boy, I cannot. I have not the key,
and if I had—</said></p>
<p>She hesitated and stopped.</p>
<p><said>What! Would you not let me out?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes,</said> she exclaimed with energy, <said>even
though Bob killed me. Ned, dear, trust to me.
I will steal the key while he is asleep and unlock
the door.</said></p>
<p>The boy thought for a moment. He knew
well the savage, vindictive character of his cousin
—for Bob Locket stood really, as you may have
guessed, in that relation to him—and he was sure
that his poor wife would suffer, and suffer terribly.</p>
<p><said>No,</said> said he at last, <said>don't you do anything
that will make him ill use you. We'll find out
another plan—</said></p>
<p>The sound of the grating of a key in the lock
of the street door here came plainly up the stair-
case, and in a terrible flutter and trembling all
over Ann Locket hastily descended the ladder and
ran down into the bar just in time to meet her
husband.</p>
<p>He scowled at her but said nothing; and turn-
ing, beckoned to some one outside. A heavy tread
of feet and in came two men in yellow fur caps
<pb n="90"/>
<fw>Ann Locket's Appeal.</fw>
like that which Locket wore, thick jackets, and
with gaudy crimson handkerchiefs round their
necks. <q>Bargee</q> was plainly written all over
their faces and their clothes, and bargees they
were.</p>
<p><said>Come on, mates,</said> growled Locket. <said>Give us
a candle, Ann. Quick!</said></p>
<p>With shaking fingers the woman tried to light
a candle, but she bungled so that her husband,
muttering, snatched the candlestick from her and
lighted it himself.</p>
<p>He was walking towards the staircase, followed
by the two men, when his wife, with her face
white as a sheet, came in front of him and barred
the passage.</p>
<p><said>What are you going to do, Bob?</said> she de-
manded.</p>
<p><said>'Tisn't no business of yours. Stand aside, will
you?</said></p>
<p><said>No; not till I know you are not going to
hurt the boy,</said> said she, clinging to his arm with
all her strength.</p>
<p><said>Of course we're not going to hurt him. Who
said we were?</said></p>
<p>And he roughly swung her aside, so that
stumbling she fell on the ground. She was up
again in a moment.</p>
<p><said>You are men,</said> she cried, panting, <said>you will
not harm a poor lad who has never done you an
injury.</said></p>
<pb n="91"/>
<fw>Ned Carried Off by the <q>Bargees.</q></fw>
<p><said>There's no harming in the matter, missis,</said>
gruffly replied one of the fellows. <said>He's 'pren-
ticed to us, that's all. There ain't no call to make
a row about it. He'll be brought up to a re-
spectiable calling and 'll earn no end of money.</said></p>
<p>Ann looked wildly from one face to the other
as if to see which face was the milder.</p>
<p><said>Come along. What are you waiting for?</said>
impatiently interposed her husband.</p>
<p>And while the woman stood helplessly by, the
three men went up the narrow rickety staircase.</p>
<p>When they got to the ladder one of the bargees
held the candle while Bob Locket climbed up to
the door of the loft. He unlocked it and savagely
called to the lad to come out.</p>
<p><said>I know what you want. You have come to
kill me. Brute, monster!</said> almost shrieked Ned.
<said>Help! help!</said> he cried.</p>
<p><said>He'll rouse the neighbourhood,</said> muttered Bob.
<said>Here, stop that noise. Don't be a fool. You
won't be hurt if you keep quiet.</said></p>
<p>And without more ado he made a dash into the
loft and seized the boy, who bit, fought, kicked
with all his might and main, and dragged him
out, delivering him like a parcel into the hands of
the second of the bargees, who deposited him
breathless and exhausted on the ground. In less
than half a minute he was bound hand and foot,
his mouth bandaged, and in this plight was carried
down by the two men. Bob Locket preceding

<fw>Bound Hand and Foot.</fw>
them, red, dishevelled, and angry, with a hand-
kerchief tied round his fingers where they had
come in contact with Ned's teeth.</p>
<p>The candle had gone out in the struggle, so that
Locket was unable to run down-stairs, and so
came unawares upon his wife, who was standing
at the foot of the staircase. Before she knew
where she was she was bundled into the room
with the bow-window and the key turned upon
her.</p>
<p><said>That's the best place for you,</said> he called out,
<said>if you can't be sensible and behave yourself.</said></p>
<p>There appeared to be some kind of light cart
waiting outside, and into this Ned was shot as if
he were so much lumber. He found it was im-
possible to move, and so there he lay looking and
really almost feeling, more dead than alive.</p>
<p>Presently the bargees got into the cart, and after
each had taken a deep draught of beer, the horse
was whipped up and he started off at a smart
pace.</p>
<p>The journey lasted apparently about twenty
minutes, when the cart came to a stop, and the
smell of pitch seemed to tell the lad they were in
the neighbourhood of ships.</p>
<p><said>Look here, youngster, if you promise to be
quiet we'll let you walk, but if you ain't quiet
why, it 'll be all the worse for you.</said></p>
<p>It was useless to think of resisting, and so Ned
promised. He was lifted out of the cart and the
<pb n="93"/>
<fw>The Barge Cabin.</fw>
rope taken off his legs. When he had collected
his senses he saw at once where he was; on the
quay of the Regent's Canal basin. One of those
long narrow, gaily painted barges was moored
close to the side, fully loaded, and the horse
standing by with the tow-rope already attached,
gave sign that a start would be soon made.</p>
<p><said>In with you,</said> growled the elder of the two
men. <said>Quick, if you don't want me to help you
with my boot.</said></p>
<p>Ned looked round, but there was not the
slightest hope of resistance, and as the men
looked remarkably evil and the water very black
and suggestive of drowning, he thought it best to
obey. Another minute and he had stepped into the
little cabin, which was filled with a dense bitter
smoke from a small stove, causing his eyes and
nose to smart and itch, the horse was urged on,
the tow-rope tightened, and the barge began to
move.</p>

<head type="main">Bob Locket Calls upon <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby</head>

<p>To say that honest Jack Grigsby, his even-
tempered, kind-hearted, blind wife, and
their granddaughter, bright-eyed,
merry little Nellie, were distressed at the dis-
appearance of Ned is to put the state of affairs
at Gibraltar Cottage very mildly indeed. A
blank seemed to have fallen on the house, and
the absence of the boy was ever brought to their
recollection by the sight of the great black mass
of iron which had been so closely connected with
his fortunes. Whenever they looked at it it
seemed mutely to appeal to them to go and find
him, yet what could they do? As we have said
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby had been to the police station, he had
wandered up and down every street in Wapping,
had gone into every court and alley, he had made
inquiries at the low lodging-houses in the hopes
that some of the lodgers—tramps and hawkers
about the streets—might have known something
of the boy; but all to no purpose.</p>
<pb n="95"/>
<fw>Jack Grigsby Puzzled.</fw>
<p><said>It's the rummest thing as ever I heard of,</said>
said the old pilot to his wife, after returning from
one of these fruitless journeys. <said>I begin a'most
to think as the boy's been hankering after his
old ways and gone back to the streets.</said></p>
<p><said>No,</said> returned the blind woman emphatically,
<said>I'll never believe <emph>that</emph>. He was too fond of us,
and we were too fond of him. He'd never be so
ungrateful. Depend upon it if we're patient we
shall find out the meaning of it all.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby shook his head doubtfully, but he
had a profound belief in the wisdom of his little
woman, and tried to think as she did, that some-
thing had happened to Ned, and that he had not
run away of his own accord.</p>
<p><said>I've been to all the hospitals to-day,</said> said he,
when he had taken off his coat and had sat down
in his shirt sleeves to his pipe. <said>But there's not
one of 'em as knows anything about the lad. There
was lads of course in some of the wards, and I
saw 'em all to make sure, but I didn't find our
Ned among 'em. What to do next, little woman,
I don't know, blest if I do.</said></p>
<p>And the pilot scratched his wrinkled brow with
the sealing-wax end of his pipe stem in great per-
plexity.</p>
<p><said>Do you know, John, I've been thinking a
good deal about Ned, and I've almost come to the
conclusion that—</said></p>
<p><said>Ah! out with it, old woman,</said> put in Jack
<pb n="96"/>
<fw>Jenny Finds a Clue.</fw>
encouragingly, taking advantage of a pause. <said>It'll
be something good, I'll be bound, if <emph>you</emph> make up
your mind.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, it's just this. Nellie was talking of
Ned the other day—poor child, she always <emph>is</emph>
talking about him—and she told me that the boy
said he should never forget the man who ill used
him. He was called Bob, but what his other
name was he couldn't remember. There was a
woman too—I suppose she was Bob's wife—Ann
was <emph>her</emph> name. Now what do you make of all
this?</said></p>
<p><said>What do <emph>I</emph> make of it?</said> repeated Jack slowly.</p>
<p><said>Yes. What did <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Locket say her son's
name was? Wasn't it Bob? And what did she
say the name of her son's wife was? Wasn't it
Ann?</said></p>
<p>Jack Grigsby drew a deep breath and collected
all his faculties.</p>
<p><said>Jenny,</said> said he in admiration, <said>blest if you
hadn't ought to be a detective. I never did see
any one like you for putting two and two toge-
ther. If Ned said as he remembered a Bob and
a Ann, and this Bob and this Ann turned him
out—</said></p>
<p><said>The woman did not,</said> interposed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby.
<said>He spoke well of her, but she seems to have
been afraid of her husband.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, well, that may be. But if another Bob
and another Ann likewise turned a boy out o'
<pb n="97"/>
<fw>The Plot Thickens.</fw>
doors, as that old woman at Lincoln said, why it
stands to reason as this Bob might be that Bob
and this Ann that Ann. And what's the conse-
kens of it all? Why, that our Ned is the t'other
Ned, and <emph>wisher worser</emph>,</said> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's pronun-
ciation of <foreign xml:lang="la">vice versa</foreign>. <said>Isn't that what you make
of it, old woman?</said></p>
<p><said>Indeed it is, Jack,</said> returned the blind woman
earnestly. <said>It is like an act of Providence that
the poor boy came to us—</said></p>
<p><said>Ah! but it ain't like an act of Providence to
send him away again just when he had a chance
of coming into his own.</said></p>
<p><said>Do not be too sure. It may all turn out
for the best. Who knows what may happen,
though everything seems now so dark and hope-
less!</said></p>
<p>There was a patter of feet outside, and Nellie
put her head inside the door.</p>
<p><said>Grandfather,</said> said she, <said>there's a man wants
to see you—very particularly, he says.</said></p>
<p><said>Very pertikler, does he? What's his name?</said></p>
<p><said>He wouldn't tell me his name. All he said
was he wanted to see you.</said></p>
<p>Jack Grigsby laid down his pipe and rose from
his chair.</p>
<p><said>Stay here, Nell, my girl, and I'll tackle this
party.</said></p>
<p>Somehow he had a suspicion that the visitor
had come to tell him some news of Ned, and fear-
<pb n="98"/>
<fw>Bob Locket Again.</fw>
ing the news might be bad he did not want his
granddaughter to hear it.</p>
<p>He strode out into the passage, but not without
some misgiving of ill tidings. He found standing
on the door-step a hard-featured man, respectably
dressed and having the appearance of a workman
in his Sunday clothes.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">Who are you?</said> thought the pilot; <said aloud="false">I don't
know your ugly face, and yet I fancy I've seen it
afore somehow.</said></p>
<p><said><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby?</said> inquired the stranger.</p>
<p><said>That's my name and I ain't ashamed of it.
What may be <emph>your</emph> business?</said></p>
<p><said>Well, I should like five minutes' talk with you,
if you don't mind. My name's Locket.</said></p>
<p><said>Locket!</said> repeated Jack to himself; <said>Sam's
sister's son, or I'm a Dutchman. I'll never con-
tradict the old woman again. She was right and
I was wrong: Providence <emph>is</emph> a working for us
after all. Come in here, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket,</said> said he
aloud.</p>
<p>And he led the way into the little parlour.</p>
<p><said>Jennie,</said> said he in a whisper to his wife,
<said>just leave us a bit, will you. I think as how
we're on Ned's track. Who d'ye think's just come?
Only that son of a sea-cook, Bob Locket. Hush!
don't you say nothing.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby accordingly left the room with
Nellie; and the pilot, pointing to a seat, bade <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Locket sit down.</p>
<pb n="99"/>
<fw>A Too-Ready Lie.</fw>
<p><said>Well, mister, I suppose as how you've come
to see me about Ned?</said></p>
<p><said>Ah! poor little Ned, we shall never see him
any more,</said> replied <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob Locket, with a noise
which he intended for a sigh.</p>
<p><said>Never see him no more! What d'ye mean?</said>
demanded the pilot. <said>You haven't come to tell
me as he's dead?</said></p>
<p><said>What! <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, didn't my mother explain
to you? I heard that you'd been to see her at
Lincoln, and that's brought me round here.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, has it?</said> retorted <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby. <said>Then
it'll suit us both, for I wanted to have a talk with
you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob Locket, only you were so precious
hard to find.</said></p>
<p><said>My mother could have told you where I was
to be found if she had liked,</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket
with great dignity.</p>
<p><said>Oh, could she? Then I suppose she didn't like.
Well, anyhow, you're here, so we'd better come
to business. Now, then, where's Ned Somerset,
my old shipmate's son?</said></p>
<p><said>You'll never see him in <emph>this</emph> world. The
poor little fellow has been dead these five years.
Drowned, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, drowned, I'm sorry to say.
Ah! it was a heavy blow for us.</said></p>
<p>The pilot listened to this in utter amazement.
To his honest, frank, open nature the idea of such
deception as he felt Bob Locket was guilty of
seemed incredible. The man's coolness fairly took
<pb n="100"/>
<fw>The Pilot Grows Angry.</fw>
away his breath, and he could only stare and
gasp.</p>
<p>But at last his indignation allowed him to find
speech. Sticking his broad, fat thumbs in the
arm-holes of his waistcoat, and stretching his legs
a little way apart, he looked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob Locket in
the face.</p>
<p><said>Why—you—rascally—scampish—loblolly—
landlubber!</said> he burst out.</p>
<p><said><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, I didn't come here to be in-
sulted,</said> growled <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket. <said>And look here, if
you're not civil I'll have the law of you. You've
got property that belongs to my mother, and if
you don't give it up I'll pretty soon make you.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, you'll make me, will you, Bob Lockup!</said>
exclaimed Jack, in his anger getting into some
confusion over his visitor's name. <said>We'll see
about that. First of all, you told me a falsehood
just now.</said></p>
<p><said>Every word as I said was gospel truth,</said> said
the man doggedly. <said>And I'll bring witnesses to
prove it.</said></p>
<p><said>I don't care <emph>that</emph> for your witnesses,</said> cried <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Grigsby, snapping his fingers. <said>The boy was
placed in your charge, wasn't he?</said></p>
<p><said>Of course he was. I never said he wasn't,
did I?</said></p>
<p><said>And now you tell me he's drowned.</said></p>
<p><said>Aye, that I do. Went down to the river side,
and was a paddling about at low water, and got
<pb n="101"/>
<fw>Injured Innocence.</fw>
into a hole out of his depth and was carried away,
and we never see him any more from that day to
this.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's answer to this was a snort of
incredulity.</p>
<p><said>It's all very well for you to stand there and
pitch me that long yarn. I don't believe a word
of it. That's plain, ain't it? I <emph>know</emph> that boy's
alive, and may be, for anything as I can tell, <emph>you</emph>
know it too.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket's eyes blinked and twinkled, and
again he tried to sigh.</p>
<p><said>I wish I did, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby; I wish I did. I
don't know who's been telling you tales about me,
but you're not acting fairly by me—you ain't,
indeed. Why, my uncle, Sam Somerset, was the
best friend as ever <emph>I</emph> had, and do you think I'd
harm a hair belonging to a son of his. 'Tain't
likely.</said></p>
<p><said>Won't do, Bob Lockup,</said> retorted the pilot.
<said>I've heard differently.</said></p>
<p><said>And who's told you, sir? I think as you
ought to tell me that.</said></p>
<p><said>Do you?</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, with his head on
one side and a knowing look on his weather-
beaten face. <said><emph>I</emph> don't; and what's more, I <emph>sha'n't</emph>
tell you.</said></p>
<p>It seemed to be <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob Locket's desire to be
on good terms with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, for he was in
no way offended with this plain speaking.</p>
<pb n="102"/>
<fw>The Piece of Old Iron.</fw>
<p><said>Of course you know best, sir, but you'll find
as I'm right. <emph>I</emph> don't benefit by the boy's death,
don't think that. It was only on my mother's
account as I came here to-day. Not but what I
shouldn't like a trifle to remember poor Captain
Sam by. Ah! he was a fine fellow.</said></p>
<p><said>Humph!</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby shortly. <said aloud="false">I won-
der what your little game is with all that soft
sawder,</said> he added to himself.</p>
<p><said>My mother was saying as you mentioned
something as wasn't worth nothing, which my
uncle had brought home. If you could see your
way to give me a trifle—I don't care how worth-
less it is—for the captain's sake, I'd take it kindly.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh! And what might your mother have said
as I mentioned?</said></p>
<p><said>Well, I couldn't exactly make out, but she
told me it was a bit of old iron. But it doesn't
much matter.</said></p>
<p>And the man's eyes, after roaming about the
room, at last fell upon the memorable cannon-ball.</p>
<p><said>That's a funny bit o' metal you've got there;
iron too. I shouldn't wonder now if that wasn't
what you meant when you talked to my mother.</said></p>
<p><said>Shouldn't you?</said> replied <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, who all
the while was taking stock of his visitor.</p>
<p><said>Is it—don't think as I'm a bit curious, it's
only that all that belonged to Captain Somerset
has a kind of interest about it—the piece of old
iron that the captain brought home?</said></p>
<pb n="103"/>
<fw>Better Known Than Trusted.</fw>
<p><said>May be it is and may be it isn't. I'm not
going to tell you. Look you here, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket,
we'd better understand what we're about before
we go any further. Now I told you just now I
don't believe your story about Ned Somerset's
death, and I may as well say it again so as there
sha'n't be any mistake. I don't believe it. There,
is that plain enough? If you want to show me
as the boy's dead you'll have to prove it. <emph>Prove</emph>
it, I say, none of your hearsay business. Very
well, that's number one. Number two is, as it's
all rubbish your saying as you come on account
of your mother. It's yourself you've got an eye
to, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob Locket; but you're not going to take
me in, because I know you better than you think
I do.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh! well, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, if you're a going to
talk like that it's no use my staying any longer—</said></p>
<p><said>Not a bit,</said> put in the pilot.</p>
<p><said>I shall have to get a lawyer to take up this
business, and he'll pretty soon show you what a
mistake you've made.</said></p>
<p><said>Very well, let him; the sooner the better.
I'm not afraid of no lawyer,</said> replied Jack
stoutly.</p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket appeared to be of opinion that he
would have no chance against the old pilot's ob-
stinacy, and so he rose from his seat, buttoned up
his coat, and put on his hat.</p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby followed him out into the passage
<pb n="104"/>
<fw>Nellie Recognises the Sham Beggar.</fw>
and opened the street door, as a broad hint that
he wished him to go.</p>
<p><said>You'll hear from me again before long, <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Grigsby,</said> said the man with a scowl.</p>
<p><said>As soon as you like. I'm not afraid of
you.</said></p>
<p>And out went <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob Locket, looking very
much smaller than when he came in.</p>
<p><said>Now <emph>where</emph> have I seen your ugly face?</said> mused
Jack Grigsby as he watched the man's departing
figure. <said>It isn't the first time I've met you, I'm
certain.</said></p>
<p>He was so absorbed in looking at his visitor
that he never heard his little granddaughter come
stealing up, and he almost started when she ex-
claimed, <said>Why, grandfather, he walks just like
that beggar you gave the bread and meat to.
Don't you remember? Before Ned went away
it was, you know.</said></p>
<p>The beggar he gave the bread and meat to!
Why, of course; how stupid of him to forget.
Bob Locket had the identical limp of the beggar,
and allowing for the difference in the face, for
the latter's was thickly incrusted with dirt and
Locket's was clean, and the difference between the
rags of the one and the good clothes of the other,
the men certainly were the same.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">I don't like this business,</said> was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's
comment, made to himself and not to Nellie. <said aloud="false">I
must see what the old woman says to it.</said></p>
<pb n="105"/>
<fw>A Horrible Suspicion.</fw>
<p>And accordingly he held a council of war with
his wife at the first opportunity.</p>
<p><said>My dear John,</said> said the blind woman, <said>if it
is as we suppose, that <emph>our</emph> Ned is Ned Somerset,
isn't it likely that this Bob Locket would be
anxious to get him out of the way? He seems to
be able to do anything with his mother, and I
daresay if this money, which belongs to Ned, was
to go to his aunt, Bob Locket would soon wheedle
it out of her?</said></p>
<p><said>That's just as it strikes me, old lady,</said> said
Jack Grigsby; <said>but you don't catch me giving
it up to any Bob Locket or his mother either.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, but it isn't in <emph>your</emph> charge.</said></p>
<p><said>No, but I can go to the owners of the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good
Fortune</name> and tell them all about it, can't I? And
they won't pay it to anybody but the proper
persons, will they? But I tell you what, Jennie,
there's one thing as I've got and I mean to stick
to it; and that's over yonder.</said></p>
<p>And <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby nodded in the direction of the
cannon-ball.</p>
<p><said>It seems curious that for so small a sum as
£100—that's what the owners have to pay, isn't
it?—this man would—</said></p>
<p><said>Would what, little woman?</said> asked Jack
Grigsby anxiously.</p>
<p><said>I don't like to say what is in my mind, John;
it seems so horrible. And I might be wrong after
all;</said> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby looked puzzled and worried.</p>
<pb n="106"/>
<fw>Jack Grigsby Tries the Law.</fw>
<p><said>I know what you're steering for,</said> returned
her husband slowly. <said>It's crossed my mind too,
but I'm half afeard to speak it out. It's my be-
lief, Jennie, that this rascal has taken our poor
Ned and made away with him to get hold of the
money.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby did not reply, but the look on her
face told her husband that she had thought so
too.</p>
<p><said>He was throwing out all sorts of hints about
that there cannon-ball, but that was only a blind.
He don't want <emph>that</emph>.</said></p>
<p><said>I think I should go to the police again, John.
If he <emph>has</emph> taken Ned away he might have him in
hiding—who can tell?</said></p>
<p><said>That's true, Jennie; that's true. I'll go at
once. I wish I'd asked the fellow where he lived.
It would have saved some trouble. Never mind,
we've got something like a clue, and it will go
hard if it don't lead us somewhere.</said></p>
<p>And the energetic old man lost no time in
struggling into his coat and rushing away to the
police station, where he confided his suspicions to
the inspector.</p>
<p><said>If what you say is true,</said> said that function-
ary, <said>it looks rather black against this <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket.
But we cannot do anything unless you charge him
with taking the boy away. Will you go as far
as that?</said></p>
<p><said>Of course I will,</said> said the old pilot boldly.</p>
<pb n="107"/>
<fw>The Law Fails.</fw>
<p><said>If you don't prove it he'll have a nice pull
against you. I suppose you know that?</said></p>
<p><said>How do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said>Why, he'll proceed against you for putting
him in prison on a false charge.</said></p>
<p><said>I'll take the risk of that. My little woman
has made up her mind as he's the man, and when
she makes up her mind about anything it's as
good as settled.</said></p>
<p>The inspector did not appear to be so convinced
of this as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby expected. However, he
took down all the particulars, and promised he
would do his best to find <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob Locket.</p>
<p>And with this assurance Jack Grigsby was
forced to be content.</p>
<p>But very little came of it. It was true that in
three or four days the police discovered <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob
Locket in the person of the landlord of the <q>Jolly
Waterman,</q> but though he was taken before the
magistrate, Jack Grigsby couldn't prove in the
least that he had had any hand in taking Ned
away.</p>
<p>The old pilot, in fact, came off rather badly, for
the magistrate wouldn't listen to the long state-
ments he wanted to make about the death of
Captain Somerset, the property, and his adoption
of Ned. Indeed, when he began to drag in allu-
sions to the cannon-ball his worship half thought
the prosecutor was not quite right in his head,
and hinted as much, greatly to Jack's indignation.</p>
<pb n="108"/>
<fw>A Grin of Triumph.</fw>
<p>The result of the business consequently was,
that Bob Locket was discharged, the magistrate
declaring that there was not the least ground for
the charge which had been brought against him.</p>
<p><said>Much obliged to you, Grigsby,</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob
Locket with a malignant grin, as he stepped out
of the dock. <said>Perhaps you'll accuse me of some-
thing else.</said></p>
<p><said>You may be sure I shall if I have reason for
it,</said> returned <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, struggling against his
indignation. <said>I've been beaten this time by the
law; when you and me come together again per-
haps you won't have the law on your side.</said></p>
<p>This was all he said. Locket was so elated by
his victory that he tried all he could to aggravate
the old man, but without success. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby
was not to be tempted into a quarrel, and made
the best of his way home to communicate his bad
tidings to his wife.</p>

<p>When Ned's eyes had got used to the
dimness of the little cabin he found it
was even smaller and dirtier than he
at first imagined it to be. It was, roughly speak-
ing, about eight feet long, six feet wide, and five
feet high. He was tall for his age, and could
just stand upright in it; but the men, who were
tall, strapping fellows, had to move about bent
nearly double. There was a little stove not far
from the door, or, to speak properly, the hatch-
way, and as it had not been long lighted, it sent
forth clouds of stifling smoke. At the farther end
of the cabin was a kind of box-bench or bunk, as
it was called on the barge, and lying on a mat-
tress, which was placed on the top of the bunk,
was a third man, whose loud snores showed he
was sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>For the first five or six minutes the two men
had enough to do, the one to look after the horse
on the tow-path and the other to hold the tiller
<pb n="110"/>
<fw>An Ugly Ruffian.</fw>
and guide the boat. By-and-by, when they ap-
proached the lock, the man who had been with
the horse jumped on board and came running into
the cabin.</p>
<p>He took no notice of the boy, but going up to
the sleeping man shook him roughly.</p>
<p><said>What are ye doing of?</said> growled the sleeper.</p>
<p><said>Coom get oop,</said> shouted the other, with a
strong north country accent.</p>
<p>The fellow struggled into a sitting posture,
rubbed his eyes, gaped, and finally slid from the
mattress on to his feet. Then looking round he
caught sight of Ned.</p>
<p><said>Hallo! who be this youngster?</said></p>
<p>Ned did not like the look of this third man at all.
He was older, uglier, and rougher looking than
the other two. His hair and beard, all ragged
and uncombed, had become matted together where
he had been lying. His nose was flattened in the
centre, where in truth he had received a blow in
a fight, which must have killed him had not his
head been unusually hard; his teeth were broken
from the same cause, and he had a dreadful squint.</p>
<p><said>He be one of us, Mattie,</said> returned the
younger man. <said>Bob Locket's youngster.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh!</said> growled Mattie. <said>He'll have to work.
We don't have no lazy boys on the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Betsy Jane</name>.
D'ye year, boy?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, I hear,</said> replied Ned, speaking up man-
fully. <said>I don't mind work.</said></p>
<pb n="111"/>
<fw>In the Canal Lock.</fw>
<p>Mattie looked at the lad as if be wasn't quite
sure he meant to be impudent, and therefore de-
served a cuff of the head, but the voice of some
one shouting from the lock was heard just at that
moment, and caused him to alter his mind.</p>
<p>Muttering something which Ned did not catch
—it was probably not worth hearing, being most
likely bad language, of which the <soCalled>bargee</soCalled> had a
large stock—he lurched out of the cabin and seized
a boat-hook, with which to prevent the barge
running against the lock gates as she went through.
The other man in the meantime had gone back
to the tow-path, where he had left the horse.</p>
<p>When the barge was between the two lock
gates Ned put his head outside the hatchway and
looked about him. How strange it all seemed!
There was the barge imprisoned between two
high walls; the moonlight, glancing on their sides,
showed them covered with ooze and slime. There
was a sound of rushing water mingled with the
unmusical clank, clank of chains and cog-wheels
opening the flood-gates. The sky seem far away,
and only a small piece of it could he see, while
below was the dark stream, looking more like ink
than water.</p>
<p>Presently he felt a slight rocking in the boat,
and then the wet, slippery walls appeared to be
sliding into the water. The sensation was so
peculiar that at first he felt frightened, but soon
he understood the meaning of it: it was the barge
<pb n="112"/>
<fw>A Perilous Voyage.</fw>
rising as the water, pouring through the flood-
gates, filled the space between the two locks.</p>
<p>And then once more he was able to see the
towing-path. The locks opened and slowly the
barge went through.</p>
<p>Fearing the man called Mattie might return and
find some fault because he was outside the cabin
and not inside, he crept back and coiled himself
up on a locker at the side of the cabin, and not
so large as the one at the end.</p>
<p>But Mattie did not make his appearance, for the
reason that the canal was crowded with barges
and great care was needed to avoid a collision.
Ned could hear Mattie running along the side of
the barge, and occasionally jumping on the top of
the cabin, all the while keeping up, in his deep
voice, a running fire of uncomplimentary obser-
vations respecting other bargees, who, in their turn,
were not slow to reply in language equally forcible.
And then now and again would come a tremen-
dous bump, which nearly shot him off the locker,
as the barge would knock against the bank or
another barge. He thought at first when he lay
down that he should go fast asleep, for, shut up
as he had been for no reason that he could tell,
and worried by thinking about what Bob Locket
intended to do with him, he had since his im-
prisonment been kept in a state of continuous
wakefulness. But now that nothing worse than
being put on board a canal-boat had happened to
<pb n="113"/>
<fw>Ned's First Day of Slavery.</fw>
him, he felt quieter and easier in his mind, and,
as we have said, expected to have slept. But the
bumps, just as he was dozing, prevented him
for a long time so doing, and it was only when
overcome with sheer fatigue and exhaustion that
he dropped off.</p>
<p>When he awoke it was broad daylight. The
barge was going along smoothly enough, and
the sounds from the bunk at the end showed he
had been joined by one of the men. Lifting up
his head cautiously and looking across he saw
to his comfort that his companion was not <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Mattie, who, as he afterwards discovered, was
taking his turn at the tiller. During the night
the fire had gone out, and he felt very cold. His
clothes seemed to be filled with moisture from the
damp air, and he ached in every limb. He got
up shivering, and began to stamp and rub himself
to get a little warmth.</p>
<p>Suddenly his occupation was interrupted by
Mattie, who roared out to him to light the fire and
get the breakfast.</p>
<p>This was rather an unreasonable request, seeing
he had never been on board a barge before in his
life and knew not where to find anything.</p>
<p>However, he did not stay long considering, and
set about doing as he was told, as the best way
out of the difficulty. Now that daylight had
penetrated into the cabin he saw that every inch
of space had been made use of. There were lockers
<pb n="114"/>
<fw>A Bad Shot.</fw>
of all shapes and sizes, pigeon-holes stuck here
and there, odd contrivances for attaching things
to, all occupied and all meant to be used.</p>
<p>And what wonder? This little cabin, but a few
feet square, was kitchen, parlour, and bedroom,
and no little amount of ingenuity had to be exer-
cised in order to find room for everything. By
dint of industrious searching he found wood,
paper, and lucifers, and began to light the fire, an
accomplishment in which he was tolerably expert,
though the flat open stove was not one to which
he was accustomed.</p>
<p>But the wood was green and filled the cabin
with smoke, and sent him off into a fit of cough-
ing, which had the effect of waking the man at
the other end.</p>
<p><said>Hallo!</said> he muttered. <said>Hold thee row.</said></p>
<p>But this was easier said than done, for Ned's
eyes were smarting, his throat was parched, and
his tongue seemed to stick to the roof of his mouth.
He burst into a cough, which was all the worse
for his trying to suppress it.</p>
<p><said>Hold thee row, I say,</said> the man repeated.</p>
<p>And then came something whizzing through
the air which glanced by the boy's head, and going
out at the hatchway caught <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mattie, who
was just crossing in front, tiller in hand, on the
nose.</p>
<p>The result was a volley in Mattie's usual style.
But of this the man inside took no notice, except-
<pb n="115"/>
<fw>Ned as Cook—Breakfast Time.</fw>
ing giving a chuckle at the shot not having been
expended wholly in vain.</p>
<p><said>Now, young shaver, let 'un see what sort o' fist
thee be at me-aking tea.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, I can make tea right enough,</said> returned
Ned confidently.</p>
<p><said>Right y'are, my lad. There's the kettle.
Catch! There's the teapot. Catch agen. There's
the tin box with the tea right behind.</said></p>
<p>And lying on his back, Coney (as Ned after-
wards found this young gentleman was called)
seized the kettle and the teapot which were in his
reach, flung them to Ned, and indicated the place
where the tea was by throwing his other boot at
a pigeon-hole near the hatchway.</p>
<p>Having boiled the water, which he procured by
dipping the kettle into the canal, and made all in
readiness for the tea, the next operation was the
frying of the bacon. Bargees have tremendous
appetites, and the great slices of fat bacon which
Ned cut at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coney's direction would have been
sufficient for a dozen ordinary persons. Soon the
bacon was hissing in the pan, and when declared
to be done turned out into a tin dish, the tea was
made, and breakfast declared to be ready. On the
signal the barge was made fast to the bank, the
horse—a half-starved miserable-looking quadruped
—given a feed of corn, and the third man came
aboard.</p>
<p>They had breakfast in a very rough and primi-
<pb n="116"/>
<fw>Good Resolutions.</fw>
tive fashion. There were no plates or forks, each
man helping himself out of the tin dish as he felt
inclined, using a great hunk of bread for a plate,
and cutting huge mouthfuls with his jack-knife.
At first Ned had an uncomfortable suspicion that
they were not going to give him any breakfast,
and as he had been kept so short of food at the
<q>Jolly Waterman,</q> the savoury smell of the bacon
had excited his appetite beyond endurance. But
he was mistaken.</p>
<p><said>Here, lad,</said> said Coney, who seemed the best-
natured of the lot, <said>take hold, or thee won't get
a bit.</said></p>
<p>And it seemed like it to see how all three were
making the bread and bacon disappear. So he
imitated the example of the others and helped
himself, taking his share of the tea, which was
handed round in a pewter pot, whenever he could
get it.</p>
<p><said>Dost thee know aught about horses, lad?</said>
asked Coney when he had satisfied his hunger.</p>
<p><said>I've held plenty of 'em,</said> said Ned.</p>
<p><said>Held 'em!</said> repeated Mattie with a gruff laugh;
<said>you ain't got to hold 'em, you've got to drive 'em.</said></p>
<p><said>All right, I'll drive 'em then,</said> said Ned readily.</p>
<p>He made up his mind from the first to do every-
thing he was told with good humour, and he was
rather disappointed at finding his efforts to please
were not received with the favour he expected.</p>
<p><said>You're one of them clever young 'uns,</said> sneered
<pb n="117"/>
<fw>Coney Takes Ned's Part.</fw>
Mattie. <said>Look at him, Buttons. He wants break-
in' in, don't he?</said></p>
<p>Buttons was the man who had hitherto been in
charge of the horse. If his name was given him
on account of his dress it was most appropriate,
for his waistcoat had a perfect regiment of bone
buttons marching by threes from his waist to his
neck.</p>
<p><said>Ah! and you're the one to do it, Mattie,</said> re-
joined <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Buttons, a coarse-featured young fellow
with a disagreeably evil look in his eye.</p>
<p><said>Look ye here, lads,</said> said Coney, bringing his
fist down with a thump on the locker. <said>Don't
ye play any tricks with the youngster, or you and
me'll have to settle accounts.</said></p>
<p>Mattie growled out something about Coney be-
ing a soft-hearted chap, but he didn't openly defy
him, while as for Buttons he said nothing. Coney
evidently was feared, and no doubt the reason lay
in his broad deep chest, his long muscular arms,
and the daring look in his eye. A word and a blow,
that was Coney's way, as the bargees well knew,
and they were mighty civil to him in consequence.</p>
<p>Breakfast over, Ned took his turn at the tow-
path with Buttons. The horse was a wretched-
looking broken-kneed animal, and at first the boy
thought he must fall down at every step. But it
was Jack's way to look wretched. He had been
ten years at canal work, and had acquired a pecu-
liar shuffling angular gait arising from the strain
<pb n="118"/>
<fw>No Way To Escape.</fw>
of the tow-rope not being directly behind him but
at one side. Jack (that was his name) could almost
be left to himself when there was a good long un-
interrupted stretch of path, but just now he wanted
some attention, because the barge had scarcely got
out of London, having, in fact, only entered the
Paddington Canal, which joins the Regent's Canal
at the western end of the metropolis.</p>
<p>It was slow work, for there were many locks to
go through and many wharfs, where barges lying
alongside blocked up the way, to pass, and it
was quite mid-day before they got into the open
country. Then, indeed, it was pretty enough, and
what with the bright sun, the pure air, the vivid
green of the trees and grass, for the summer sun
had not yet taken off their freshness, the blue sky
and the joyous singing of the birds, the boy thought
there might be many a worse occupation than that
which the bargees had. But this was only the
bright side of canal life; he had not yet seen the
reverse of the picture.</p>
<p>And then he had not forgotten his friends at
Stepney. He was shrewd enough to know that
his cousin had not stolen him away without a
purpose, and he had made up his mind to escape
at the first opportunity, and find his way back to
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's home somehow. Not that there
was the least chance of escaping at present There
was, of course, always one man at the tiller, and
generally a second at the bows, to say nothing of
<pb n="119"/>
<fw>Buttons Grows Confidential.</fw>
Buttons, who walked with him on the tow-path.
But Buttons, so he heard him say, was to leave
them after they got into the Grand Junction
Canal, which they expected to do on the second
day after leaving Paddington, and so there would
be one the less to keep watch over him.</p>
<p>Nor was he sorry that Buttons was going. This
gentleman had not the slightest disposition to do
any more work than was absolutely required of
him. Squatting lazily on the old horse he let
Ned do all the work of lifting the tow-rope over
obstacles and watching so that it ran clear, of
helping the lock-keeper, and of detaching and
attaching the horse whenever it was necessary.</p>
<p>Sometimes he deigned to be companionable, and
would tell the boy a few things which made him
think that after all life on shore was preferable to
life on a canal.</p>
<p><said>Got any brothers and sisters?</said> said he in an-
swer to Ned's inquiry. <said>I should think I had.
There was eight of us, and we was all brought up
on a barge. I was born on a barge, and so was
my brother Tom. I've lived in a barge all my
life, and I dare say I'll die in one. These Grand
Junction boats ain't bad, mind you, but don't you
never get aboard a Staff'udshire boat. Some of
them boats as bring up stone to Birming'am let
in water like a sieve. Roomatics lays hold on you
afore you know where you are, and rats—there,
them Staff'udshire boats is regular nests.</said></p>
<pb n="120"/>
<fw>The Brickfields.</fw>
<p>And then <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Buttons, filling a black pipe with
the very strongest tobacco, puffed a huge cloud,
greatly to his own enjoyment, but not much to
the enjoyment of Jack, judging by the way in
which he shook his head and laid back his
ears.</p>
<p>Past Twyford, past Hanwell, where, as Buttons
informed Ned, was a big asylum to put mad
people into, the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Betsy Jane</name> at last reached the
Grand Junction Canal, and leaving the county
of Middlesex behind, entered Buckinghamshire.
What struck Ned most was the number of bricks
everywhere. They passed innumerable brickfields
on either side, where both men and women and
children were busily at work, the women wheel-
ing barrows just like the men; the barges were
all laden with bricks, and the air for miles was
mixed with a disagreeably smelling vapour which
came from the brick-kilns. The canal only skirted
Buckinghamshire for a very short distance, in fact,
as any one will see by the map, it just goes in and
comes out again, not into Middlesex but into Hert-
fordshire. Ned, of course, knew nothing of this.
To him one county was as good as another, and it
was only some years afterward that he traced his
journey in the canal-boats on the map.</p>
<p>But he well recollected this Hertfordshire por-
tion of his voyage, because at one part the canal
went through a beautiful place called Cassiobury
Park, and coming as it did immediately after the
<pb n="121"/>
<fw>On the Watch.</fw>
ugliness of the brickfields it was the more im-
pressed on his memory.</p>
<p>By the time Buttons had left he was able to
look after the horse single-handed. Even Mattie,
who seldom had a good word for him, deigned to
say that something might be made of him though
he was not born and bred on the canal.</p>
<p>But this praise did not in the least turn him
from his purpose of running away. It seemed an
easy thing to do, yet never once did he get the
chance. There was always one or the other watch-
ing him, and at last he began to think that they
suspected what was passing in his mind.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">I'll be as artful as you,</said> he thought. <said aloud="false">I'll
make you believe I want to stay with you and
be a bargee, and then we'll see whether you can
keep me.</said></p>
<p>And so on the barge went, following the canal
in its never-ceasing turns and twists through
Hertfordshire, again into Buckinghamshire, this
time for many miles, and into Northamptonshire
as far as Northampton, getting farther away
from London every day, and making his chances
of escape appear more and more hopeless.</p>

<head type="main">Lampard Announces the Failure of the Plot</head>

<p>The Stranger's Home in the West India
Dock Road is a very useful institution.
Here are often collected together men
from half the nations under the sun. Indeed the
expression, <q>the nations under the sun</q> indicates
as nearly as possible the kind of people who come
to the home, for it is chiefly peopled by Asiatics.
Coolies, Malays, Lascars, and Chinese are here to
be found in abundance, the advantage of the place
being that they are permitted to follow their own
habits in so far as eating and drinking are con-
cerned. And this matter to the natives of Eastern
nations is a very important one. With the Hin-
doo, for instance, what he eats and drinks is part
of his religion, and at the Stranger's Home he can
observe the customs of his fathers and avoid losing
caste, a serious affair for him, as he would find
when he returned to India.</p>
<p>There is something very quaint and un-Euro-
pean in the appearance of the general day-room.
<pb n="123"/>
<fw>A Motley Crew.</fw>
The costumes of the East are far more picturesque
than our angular coats and trousers of sombre
cloth. The black-skinned race, too, delights in
bright colours, and very effective is the contrast
between their dark complexions and the varied
tints of their dresses. Not that they are all gor-
geously attired, for the Chinese mostly wear their
costume of celestial blue, and the Hindoos have
tunics, trousers, and turbans all of white, but
these dresses all of one colour only serve to show
off those of many colours, and so add to the
general effect.</p>
<p>And then the din! Not the harsh guttural
sound of the German; not the loud deep voice of
the Englishman, but the soft almost shrill tones
of the Asiatic. The curious combination of half
a dozen languages all different, but uttered in
voices which bear a certain kind of family resem-
blance, cannot be described, it can only be realized
by actual experience. Very likely the confusion
of tongues at the Tower of Babel sounded much
the same as the din in the large room of the
Stranger's Home.</p>
<p>Squatting on a piece of matting was a China-
man in his loose blue dress and pigtail. He was
busily engaged in mending a pair of trousers, and
the way in which he handled his needle showed
that he was an adept in the art of tailoring.</p>
<p>He was so absorbed in his work that he failed
to hear his name pronounced by a tall Yankee-
<pb n="124"/>
<fw>Bad News for Ah Ling Foo.</fw>
looking fellow, who we may say at once was our old
friend Hosea Lampard, once mate of the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good For-
tune</name>, and now loafing about on shore for no particu-
lar purpose so far as his shipmates could make out.</p>
<p><said>If I don't believe as you Jack Chineymen
ain't come straight away from ants,</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Lampard in his nasal twang. <said>Wasn't there an
ant somewhere in your family, Ah Ling Foo?</said></p>
<p>The Chineyman looked up and grinned. He
didn't quite understand what Lampard meant,
but he evidently took it to be a compliment by
his pleased expression.</p>
<p><said>Look here, just you put that patchwork away.
I'm in a hurry, I tell <emph>you</emph>, and when I'm in a hurry
I'm easily riled, and when I'm riled I'm a rasper,
and that's a fact.</said></p>
<p>Ah Ling Foo seemed quite disposed to take
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lampard's word, for he gathered up his work
and jumped to his feet with considerable alacrity,
and the two walked together to a corner of the
room where there was no one within hearing.</p>
<p><said>Melikee boss muchee good talkee for poor
lillee Chinaman?</said> asked Ah Ling Foo in his
pigeon English.</p>
<p><said>No. American boss hasn't, I reckon. The
thing's all off. Can't be done. Smashed up.
There ain't a corncake in New York as is so
smashed up as this business. <emph>You</emph> take my word
for it, Ah Ling Foo, and get back to 'Frisco as
soon as you can. That's <emph>your</emph> ticket.</said></p>
<pb n="125"/>
<fw>A Dismal Howl.</fw>
<p>The Chinaman stared at Lampard in dismay.
His little twinkling eyes suddenly expanded, and
his pigtail positively bristled.</p>
<p><said>Go backee, backee!</said> he half screamed. <said>No,
me not go to Melikee.</said></p>
<p><said>Very well, do as you like. Only I tell you
fair and square that I've nothing more to do with
the business. I've turned it up, I have.</said></p>
<p>And to show his perfect indifference, Lampard
stuck his hands in his pockets and began whist-
ling, while Ah Ling Foo almost danced in despair.</p>
<p><said>Ah! you cheat poor lillee Chinaman,</said> he
squeaked out. <said>Melikee man one big cheat.</said></p>
<p><said>I reckon you'd best be civil, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ah Ling Foo,
or you and me will fall out,</said> returned the Yankee,
a fierce look suddenly leaping into his eyes. <said>I
ain't one to mince matters, and if you call me
names you'll see what I can do. You know me
afore to-day.</said></p>
<p>Whether it was the threatening aspect of Lam-
pard, or whether there was something in his
words that reminded the Chinaman of some un-
pleasant bygone occurrence, we cannot say, but
his rage suddenly changed into grief, and he
began to utter the most dismal lamentations.</p>
<p><said>Come, stop that row, or somebody 'll be
wanting to know what's the matter,</said> said Lam-
pard shaking him by the arm.</p>
<p>And indeed this seemed very likely, for Ah
Ling Foo's howls were no whispers, but full-
<pb n="126"/>
<fw>An Artful Card.</fw>
bodied tones such as almost everybody in the
room could hear had it not been for the incessant
din which prevailed.</p>
<p><said>Now, don't you be a fool, and I'll tell you
what I'll do for you. I guess I'll fix you up. As
it's through me you've stopped here, I'll pay your
passage to Melbourne. Ain't that fair?</said></p>
<p><said>Me not go Australee,</said> peremptorily returned
the Chinese.</p>
<p><said>Wa'al I've given you the chance. Sha'n't
offer any more. We'd better say quits and make
tracks. You take your road and I'll go mine.</said>
And without a word Lampard turned on his heel
and walked out of the building, leaving Ah Ling
Foo to his weeping and wailing.</p>
<p>Strange to say the American's departure seemed
to be a source of consolation to the Chinese. He
ceased his doleful cries directly Lampard's back
was turned, and dried his eyes with marvellous
celerity. Then he took a little piece of paper out
of his pocket and read some writing which was
on it two or three times over as it he were learn-
ing a lesson. His little eyes twinkled, his yellow
face screwed itself up into lines, making it look
indescribably cunning, and he chuckled and rubbed
his hands together with intense enjoyment.</p>
<p>His next proceeding was to run out of the room
and hasten to the doorway. Lampard had not
yet gone, but was standing at the bottom of the
steps switching the pavement with a rattan cane.</p>
<pb n="127"/>
<fw>Bob Locket at Home Again.</fw>
<p>Ah Ling Foo ran down the steps and twitched
him by the arm.</p>
<p><said>You pay my money? Very good. All right.
Lillee Chinaman go.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh! you've come round, have you? You're a
cute chap after all, Ah Ling, I guess. Wa'al you
meet me at the East Indy Docks to-morrow
mornin' and I'll clear you out straight away.</said></p>
<p>Ah Ling Foo nodded his head in reply to this
with much readiness, and returned indoors ap-
parently much comforted, while Lampard wended
his way towards the waterside at Limehouse.</p>
<p>The <q>Jolly Waterman</q> was his destination, and
walking fast his long legs enabled him to get
there in a comparatively short time.</p>
<p>There were the usual sailor-like looking fellows
lounging over the bar just as they did when we
were first introduced to the place, and for aught
that one could tell from their appearance they
might never have moved since that time. They
looked round when Lampard entered, but seeing
that he was of the same profession as themselves,
they went on with their gossiping and drinking
as before.</p>
<p>Bob Locket was behind the bar, and he nodded
a salute to the American.</p>
<p><said>Coming behind, cap'en?</said> said he jerking his
thumb towards the little parlour overlooking the
river.</p>
<p><said>Wa'al, yes, I think I will,</said> drawled Lampard.</p>
<pb n="128"/>
<fw><q>The Game is Up.</q></fw>
<p><said>Didn't expect to see you cap'en,</said> said Locket
when they got inside. <said>Anything amiss?</said></p>
<p><said>I should rayther guess there was.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket's pale face became a little paler.</p>
<p><said>What—what is it?</said> he stammered.</p>
<p><said>Only that our little game's all up.</said></p>
<p><said>All up! I don't understand you.</said></p>
<p><said>Wa'al, that rascally Chinese has sold us all.
Put us on a false scent. The story he told you,
and the story he told me, was nothing but cram-
mers, sir, nothing but crammers.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket stared hard at the American while he
was making this statement, and took a long breath.</p>
<p><said>But you said yourself it was true, cap'en,</said> he
gasped.</p>
<p><said>Wa'al, sir, I believed it just as you did. I don't
know no more than what Ah Ling Foo told me.</said></p>
<p><said>But I've seen it at old Grigsby's home.</said></p>
<p><said>I reckon you have. Didn't you go on purpose?
Grigsby keeps it on his <choice><reg>sideboard</reg><orig>side-board</orig></choice>, you know, so
you said.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, and I spoke the truth. But what does
this ugly cheating Chinaman mean by telling us a
parcel of falsehoods?</said></p>
<p><said><emph>I</emph> don't know. The critters are born liars,
that's what it is, I s'pose, sir.</said></p>
<p>The landlord of the <q>Jolly Waterman</q> did not
attempt to conceal his annoyance at this intelli-
gence. It was true he did not weep or wail like
Ah Ling Foo, but he walked up and down the
<pb n="129"/>
<fw>A Handsome Offer.</fw>
room, and stamped on the floor, and muttered all
sorts of unfriendly wishes towards the Chinaman.
Then having let off the steam he became calmer
and walked up to the American, who had in the
meantime made himself comfortable by cocking
his legs on the table.</p>
<p>Looking him full in the face he said, <said>And
what are you going to do, Captain Lampard?</said></p>
<p><said>I'm a man as ain't easily taken back, <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Locket, I'm going back to my old trade. Shall
be down at the docks the first thing in the mornin',
don't you make no mistake.</said></p>
<p>It was singular how Bob Locket stared at Lam-
pard, while Lampard, on the contrary, seemed dis-
inclined to look Locket in the face.</p>
<p><said>Oh I see!</said> said the latter after a pause. <said>Then
you've given it up, have you?</said></p>
<p><said>I should think I had. What's the use, eh?</said></p>
<p><said>True, as you say, what's the use?</said> echoed
Locket.</p>
<p><said>I'm sorry you wasted your time, but it wasn't
my fault, you know.</said></p>
<p><said>Of course it wasn't.</said></p>
<p><said>But I don't want anybody to lose by me.
That ain't Lampard's way nohow. If a couple of
pound 'll make it all right with you, why, there
it is. I can't say fairer nor that, I reckon.</said></p>
<p><said>Cap'en, you're a trump!</said> suddenly exclaimed
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket holding out a grimy hand in the most
affectionate manner.</p>
<pb n="130"/>
<fw>Let Him Laugh Who Wins.</fw>
<p>Lampard held out his hand in return, and
modestly replied that all he wanted was to do the
right thing.</p>
<p><said>You haven't got the money about you, I sup-
pose,</said> said Locket.</p>
<p><said>Yes, sir. I can accommodate you.</said></p>
<p>And accordingly taking out a greasy purse he
opened it, and handed two sovereigns to the land-
lord of the <q>Jolly Waterman.</q></p>
<p><said>Wa'al, sir,</said> said the American rising, <said>I must
be off. I've got business to look after before I
start, and ain't got too much time. I hope the
next time as we go partners we'll have better luck.</said></p>
<p><said>I hope so too, cap'en,</said> rejoined Locket fervently.</p>
<p>He saw his visitor to the door again, shook
hands with him, and retired once more to the
little parlour, where he indulged in some grimaces
expressive of the utmost joy. Evidently, in spite
of his annoyance but shortly before, he was now
in the best of spirits. Strange to say the American
also was by no means depressed. He was not
given to laughing, but the way in which he showed
his yellow teeth on his road to his lodgings was
as near like a laugh as his face was capable of.</p>
<p>The next morning both he and Ah Ling Foo
were at the East India Docks, and afterwards
adjourned to a shipping office in the city, where
Lampard took a third-class passage for Ah Ling
Foo in a ship which was to sail for Port Adelaide
in about a week's time.</p>

<p>Hosea Lampard was undoubtedly a
man who had all his wits about him, and
it may be supposed that he had not spent
three months on shore for nothing. What his
object was did not quite appear, but that it had
something to do with Gibraltar Cottage was toler-
ably certain. He walked <emph>down</emph> Bromly Street
and he walked <emph>up</emph> Bromly Street. He surveyed
the house from the back as near as he could get
to it—which, however, was not very near, for the
gardens of several houses intervened between it
and the nearest point of observation—and he
examined it from either side. Indeed, had it been
his intention to take a picture of it back to Ame-
rica he could not have looked at it more intently.</p>
<p>After paying the passage-money for Ah Ling
Foo he walked from the city towards the East-
end, and again gazed at the object which fascin-
ated him, the occupants of the little cottage being
all the while in blissful ignorance of the attention
<pb n="132"/>
<fw>Lampard Prepares for a Job.</fw>
which was paid to them. Indeed, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lampard
did not seem particularly anxious to be recognized,
for though he came pretty near to the house he
never absolutely passed it, turning back so soon
as he reached a spot where he might be seen from
any of the windows.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">I don't see why it shouldn't be done to-night,</said>
he said to himself as he walked reflectively up
the street. <said aloud="false">The old man thinks I'm away at
sea, so he won't suspect me. Ah Ling Foo I've
put nicely off the scent, and that tarnation rogue.
Locket, as well. How they were took in! He,
he, he!</said></p>
<p>And <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hosea Lampard burst into a snigger,
which did not make his face handsomer.</p>
<p><said>Yes, I'll do the job straight off,</said> he repeated.</p>
<p>And full of this resolution he turned in the
direction of Ratcliff Highway, in the neighbour-
hood of which he resided. As he walked along
the streets he kept looking first at one side and
then at the other, as though he were in search of
some particular kind of shop. At last he found
what he wanted; it was a dealer's in second-hand
tools, opposite to which he stopped and looked
curiously at the odd collection of saws, files, ham-
mers, chisels, and planes. After turning the stock
over he bought a file, a chisel, and a piece of iron
about a foot in length and sharpened at one end.
This tool is known as a cold chisel, and is made
of a tough iron and very strong.</p>
<pn n="133"/>
<fw>A Queer Lodger.</fw>
<p>With these purchases he hastened home. It
was then about six o'clock, and saying to himself
he had plenty of time, he sat down to his dinner,
which he devoured very quickly, not because he
was in a hurry, but because it was his fashion, as
it is the fashion of many Americans, to devour his
food rapidly.</p>
<p>Dinner over, he filled his pipe with the very
strongest cake-tobacco, the cutting up of which
formed a pleasant half-hour's amusement, and
blew a cloud which almost filled the little room.
Indeed, when his landlady came in to ask him
whether he would be at home for supper she could
scarcely see him, so thick was the smoke.</p>
<p><said>Sha'n't be in to-night, ma'am,</said> said Lampard.
<said>Got to be down to the London Docks at three
o'clock to-morrow morning. An old shipmate of
mine goes to New York, and I want to send a
message particular. The tide's sure at three, and
I reckon I'll go down as far as Gravesend with
him, ma'am.</said></p>
<p><said>Then I'll leave the door unbolted, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lam-
pard.</said></p>
<p><said>Right you are, ma'am.</said></p>
<p><said>Good-night, sir.</said></p>
<p>And away went <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Raggett, thinking she
should not like to turn out at two o'clock in the
morning for the purpose of sending a message
across the seas. But sailors are used to all sorts
of uncomfortable things, and getting up at odd
<pb n="134"/>
<fw>A Dog-Sleep.</fw>
hours was not the same hardship to them as to
other people.</p>
<p>After <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lampard had finished his second,
third, and fourth pipe, it was ten o'clock, and
stretching his long legs and arms till they seemed
nearly to reach from side to side, he yawned a
fearful yawn, disclosing a huge cavern of a mouth,
and then rising from his chair threw himself upon
the couch, and in a very few minutes was fast
asleep.</p>
<p>There are some men whose rest is not mea-
sured by the regularity which sends you to bed
every evening, say at eleven, and bids you rise
at seven. Hosea Lampard was one of these men.
He could go to sleep whenever he chose to lie
down, and he could also wake at whatever time
he wished. This faculty, no doubt, he acquired
from his long acquaintance with sea life, where
short periods of rest are the rule and not the ex-
ception.</p>
<p>Accordingly, having determined in his own
mind that he would wake at two o'clock in the
morning, wake he did almost to the minute.</p>
<p>The fire had gone out, the candle had burnt
down in the socket and was alternately flicker-
ing and flaring, and altogether the room looked
the reverse of cheerful. Hosea Lampard, however,
was not easily affected by outward appearances,
and he jumped up briskly enough as soon as he
was awake.</p>
<pb n="135"/>
<fw>An Early Expedition.</fw>
<p>There was just light enough for him to see his
way about in the room, and he took a large lea-
ther bag from a chair, opened it, and put his hand
inside.</p>
<p><said>All right,</said> he said softly to himself. <said>Lan-
tern, one; chisel, two; file, three; and cold chisel,
four. Good!</said></p>
<p>And putting on his cap he seized the bag,
opened the door, went gently down-stairs, and
the next minute was in the street.</p>
<p>It was pretty evident that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hosea Lampard
had either made a great mistake in informing his
landlady he was going to the London Docks, or that
he had no scruple about telling falsehoods. I am
afraid, from what you have seen of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lampard's
character, that you will think it was the latter
and graver fault he was guilty of, when I say that
instead of walking towards the London Docks he
went in a totally opposite direction.</p>
<p>His route lay towards Stepney, and it was not
long before he was in the Commercial Road. One
or two policemen as he passed them looked suspi-
ciously at him, but it was nothing unusual to see
in that neighbourhood a seafaring man with a
leather bag in his hand hastening along in the
small hours of the morning. The time at which
ships go out of dock depends upon the tide, and
as time and tide wait for no man, much less for
any ship, advantage is always taken, no matter
at what inconvenient hour the tide turns, to save
<pb n="136"/>
<fw>The Empty House.</fw>
the three or four hours' difference which going
with or against the tide makes in sailing down
the river Thames.</p>
<p>And so when a policeman turned his bull's-eye
upon him and said, <said>Good morning,</said> Lampard
answered cheerily enough, <said>Good morning.</said></p>
<p>Burford Street was the American's destination,
that much was certain, for he turned down that,
to us by this time, well-known street and slack-
ened his pace. At half-past two in the morning
in the month of March it is quite dark, and so it
was on this occasion. Nor was it a pleasant morn-
ing either. There was a cold wind blowing, and
a mixture of rain, snow, and sleet falling; and
Hosea Lampard, in spite of his being accustomed
to all kinds of weather, did not feel altogether
comfortable, though the wet made little impression
on his rough pea-jacket.</p>
<p><said>The rain's all in my favour, I guess. A police-
man's a fool if he walks about in this beastly
morning when he can get under cover,</said> he mut-
tered.</p>
<p>And this really seemed to be the case, for as
far as he had yet gone down Burford Street he had
not met a soul.</p>
<p><said>Now for this empty house I spotted yesterday.</said></p>
<p>This was a house to let three doors from Gib-
raltar Cottage. Just casting a glance up and down
the street, and listening for a few moments for
the measured tread of the policeman's step. Lam-
<pb n="137"/>
<fw>The <soCalled>Admiral</soCalled> on Guard.</fw>
pard, finding all was safe, went up to the window
of the empty house, which he had previously
noted was without shutters. The insertion of the
long thin blade of his knife between the two
sashes enabled him to push back the catch. He
gently opened the window, stepped into the room,
shut the window again, and fastened it.</p>
<p>Of course, once in the house it was the easiest
thing in the world to shoot back the bolts of the
door leading into the garden. This he did, and
once more stood in the pelting rain. He was now
but three gardens away from Gibraltar Cottage,
and once there he knew he could work undis-
turbed at the shutters of the back windows or the
door, whichever proved to be the least protected.</p>
<p>The walls of most London gardens are low, and
a tall, active man like Lampard found no difficulty
in scaling the three which separated him from
Jack Grigsby's garden. In less than five minutes
he was standing by the old boat summer-house,
staring up at the figure of the admiral, which loomed
through the darkness like some huge spectre.</p>
<p>Hosea Lampard was by no means a timid man,
but the appearance of the admiral whose very
decided profile showed sufficiently distinct, dark
though it was, to allow him to tell that it was the
features of a man he was staring at—was ghostly
enough to deter him from advancing further.</p>
<p>While he was deciding who or what the admiral
might be, and when he had nearly come to the
<pb n="138"/>
<fw>Unexpected Company.</fw>
conclusion that it was an inanimate figure he
caught sight of something which seemed to be
nothing more or less than a moving shadow, so
noiseless was it.</p>
<p><said>If that ain't a tarnation policeman, bu'st him!</said>
was his uncomplimentary exclamation.</p>
<p>Discretion seemed to him the better part of
valour, and so he slipped into the summer-house,
there to wait until the policeman should have
completed his inspection and taken his departure.
But this, so far as he could make out, the policeman
appeared to be in no hurry to do. He was still
in the garden, of that the American was sure, and
intently hiding himself in the garden. But why?
That was the puzzle. Lampard was certain no
one had seen him get over the walls, and if he
had been noticed since reaching Grigsby's garden
why did not the policeman try to take him into
custody? One thing certainly was clear, he could
not make any attempt to break into the pilot s
house (for, I suppose, there is no use in concealing
the fact that this was the American's object) while
that hateful figure was lurking about in the cor-
ner by the admiral.</p>
<p>While he was chafing and muttering all kinds
of evil things, he caught sight of a <emph>second</emph> figure
in the opposite corner to that in which the first
had stationed himself. Could it be that the police
had surrounded him? He really began to feel
very uncomfortable.</p>
<pb n="139"/>
<fw>A Sudden Scramble.</fw>
<p>Half an hour passed away, and Lampard began
to feel chilled to the bone, for standing still is
very different from walking fast, when it is not
so difficult to keep warm. He was afraid to move
the least bit in the world lest he should attract
attention, and was quite cramped with standing
in one position.</p>
<p>And then half-past three sounded from a neigh-
bouring church, and it occurred to him that before
long daylight would appear, and how should he
make his escape? As for attempting to get into
the house, that was totally out of the question;
he was positively in a very awkward predicament.
Once or twice he made a movement to see if there
was a chance of escaping, but the policemen were
evidently on the alert, for they moved too.</p>
<p>Four o'clock, and the sky had passed from an
inky blackness to a bluish gray. The summer-
house was in full view of the corners where the
two who were watching him had <choice><corr>ensconced</corr><orig>ensconsed</orig></choice> them-
selves, and the lighter it became the more difficulty
he would have in concealing himself. Indeed in
broad daylight he knew it would be impossible.</p>
<p>He grew desperate.</p>
<p><said>I must make a bolt for it, I guess,</said> he mut-
tered. <said>I was a fool not to have done it when it
was darker.</said></p>
<p>And setting his teeth, and nerving himself for
a rapid scramble over the wall, he made a sudden
dart from his hiding-place. Now, it so happened
<pb n="140"/>
<fw>A Pair of Scoundrels.</fw>
that just as he began to run one of the figures
began to do so too. They met at the wall unex-
pectedly, and the collision nearly threw both on
the ground.</p>
<p>The worst had come to the worst. Lampard
recovered himself first, and made a lunge forward
with the amiable intention of knocking the police-
man down; but before he could do so he heard
his name pronounced, and by a voice too that
he knew.</p>
<p><said>Bob Locket, as I'm alive!</said> he ejaculated, the
discovery taking the strength completely out of
his arms, which dropped down helplessly by his
sides.</p>
<p><said>Cap'en Lampard!</said></p>
<p>The discovery was so startling that the two
stood and looked at each other open-mouthed.
Their confusion was absolutely comical.</p>
<p><said>Is that you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob Locket, who has been
over in that corner for the last hour and a ha'af?</said>
asked Lampard slowly.</p>
<p><said>I should think it was,</said> returned Locket slowly.
<said>And I suppose as it's you I've seen dodging me in
that summer-house.</said></p>
<p><said>You ain't far out. And who's the other coon?</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket put his finger to his lips in token of
silence.</p>
<p><said>He's a policeman. I'm afraid he's got his
mates somewhere, as he don't follow us. This is a
bad business. We shall be collared as sure as fate.</said></p>
<pb n="141"/>
<fw>And a Third.</fw>
<p>And <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob Locket's miserable face looked as
if he did not regard his prospects with anything
like satisfaction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lampard's sharp rat-like eyes were
peering about towards the corner occupied by the
third man, and the next moment, to Locket's as-
tonishment, bounded forward and dragged out,
wet through to the skin, shivering with cold, and
more dead than alive—Ah Ling Foo!</p>
<p>What a scene it was! No need for explanation.
It was too evident that each, believing his com-
panions were thrown off the scent, had come with
the intention of carrying off the much-coveted
cannon-ball, and had all three in turn mistaken
the other two for policemen!</p>
<p>Hosea Lampard was thus a little <emph>too</emph> cute, and
nicely overreached himself.</p>
<p>The morning broke fine after the rainy and
bitter night, and with a change of wind.</p>
<p>The effect of this improvement was that Nellie
was able to go in the garden. Now March, as
every gardener knows, is a capital month for sow-
ing seeds, and as the little girl had got sundry
packets, each bearing a dreadfully long Latin
name upon it, filled with seeds, it occurred to her
that the morning being fine she could not do
better than put them into the ground.</p>
<p>Accordingly, armed with rake and spade, she
sallied forth to a little bed in the neighbourhood
of the admiral, which bed she had selected, indeed,
<pb n="142"/>
<fw><q>A Man's Foot.</q></fw>
on account of its nearness to the wooden gentle-
man in question.</p>
<p>Everyone who has read <title>Robinson Crusoe</title>—and
who hasn't?—will remember the fright into which
Robinson was thrown when he first beheld Friday's
footprint in the sand. Now, astonished and terri-
fied as the famous Crusoe was, I doubt whether
his astonishment and terror equalled Nellie's when
she found on her flower-bed, not one footprint,
but half a dozen, and so firmly impressed in the
soft ground that almost the hob-nails were visible.</p>
<p>Like a wild thing she flew into the house and
dashed into the parlour, where Jack Grigsby was
spelling out the newspaper.</p>
<p><said>Oh grandfather—grandfather!</said> she half-
screamed.</p>
<p><said>Eh, eh, what—what? Bless me, child, what's
the matter? You haven't gone mad, have you?</said></p>
<p><said>Come and look—in the garden,</said> was all Nellie
could say.</p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby first laid down the newspaper and
then took off his spectacles, for like most brave
men he was cool and deliberate in the hour of
danger, and from the appearance of his grand-
daughter's face he could not but think that some-
thing had happened.</p>
<p><said>You're not hurt, my dear, are you?</said></p>
<p><said>No, no—but it's in the garden. A man—I
saw his foot.</said></p>
<p><said>Saw a man's foot!</said> slowly replied the pilot,
<pb n="143"/>
<fw>The Trail of the Thieves.</fw>
rising from his chair. <said>And didn't you see any-
thing else but his foot?</said></p>
<p><said>No—that is, I didn't quite see his foot, you
know. But it's as plain as—as anything,</said> re-
joined Nell, at a loss for a simile.</p>
<p><said>You didn't quite see his foot, and yet it's as
plain as anything. That's rum,</said> was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's
comment.</p>
<p>But they had by this time reached the garden,
Nellie in her impatience almost pulling her grand-
father forward.</p>
<p><said>There, there, don't you see?</said> she exclaimed.</p>
<p><said>I don't see no foot nowhere,</said> replied the old
man, who had some notion he should see a man's
boot or shoe.</p>
<p><said>It isn't a foot, grandfather,</said> rejoined Nellie,
with an impatient stamp of her own little foot.
<said>I told you it wasn't. It's a foot-<emph>step</emph>.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, a footstep! That's a different thing alto-
gether. I must look into this, my dear.</said></p>
<p>And <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby undoubtedly suited the action
to the word when he saw that his granddaughter
had told no more than the truth.</p>
<p>A further search revealed the fact that Nellie's
flower-bed was not the only place which had been
profaned by the footsteps of the intruders.</p>
<p>On the right-hand bed there was a long line
leading from the wall to the summer-house, and
on the left was another line leading <emph>from</emph> the
summer-house to the other wall, terminating here
<pb n="144"/>
<fw>Nellie's Discovery.</fw>
in a number of confused marks and dents in the
ground, as if somebody had been tramping about
very much.</p>
<p><said>Well this <emph>is</emph> a rum go and no mistake,</said> ex-
claimed Jack Grigsby when he had made these
discoveries.</p>
<p>Of course he could see but one solution of the
mystery, and that was—thieves. But he did not
like to tell Nellie so for fear of frightening her.</p>
<p><said>Who do you think has done it?</said> she asked,
holding the old man's hand very tight.</p>
<p><said>Well,</said> returned <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, scratching his
head as if the process assisted his invention,
<said>pr'aps it's workmen.</said></p>
<p><said>Workmen, grandfather! Workmen don't clam-
ber over walls and trample gardens about, do
they?</said></p>
<p><said>Some do,</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, speaking in such
a tone of firm conviction that you would have
thought he really believed there was a species of
workman who habitually turned himself into a
stag and leaped over back garden walls and clawed
up the ground, instead of going to work peaceably
and rationally along the queen's highway. <said>You
know if they've been a painting up that empty
house at the back, they'd have to get over the
walls, don't you see, because there'd be nobody
in the house to let 'em in.</said></p>
<p>This was a most ingenious theory, and Jack
flattered himself that he had furnished a reason-
<pb n="145"/>
<fw>The Truth Comes Out.</fw>
able explanation, and had got out of the dilemma
beautifully. Whether Nellie believed it or not he
never stopped to inquire, but went on hurriedly
to say that they'd better go in and tell the news
to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby.</p>
<p>The result of the consultation was—for of course
it was of no use bringing the blind woman out
into the garden to <emph>see</emph> the footprints—that the
police were sent for, with the result that Miss
Nellie soon discovered that the workman theory
was all moonshine, and that thieves really had
made their way into the garden.</p>

<head type="main">Ned Makes his Escape</head>

<p>Ned's life on board the canal-boat had
grown to be dreary and monotonous,
and even worse. It was dreary and
monotonous because of the absence of companion-
ship, and it was worse than being dreary and
monotonous because of the rough usage of Mattie.
It must not be supposed that the boat simply
went to a place and then came back again, or
that it took a boat-load the whole journey from
London and never stopped on the way. Between
Northampton and the metropolis it had unloaded
and reloaded once, and this process took up a
good deal of time. Ned would not have cared
much for this had it not been that Coney and
Mattie, having nothing to do in the evening,
generally spent their time in the little beer-houses
on the canal banks, where they drank such deep
draughts of the weak washy beer that one would
have supposed they were hollow right down to
their boots.</p>
<pb n="147"/>
<fw>A Brutal Attack.</fw>
<p>On these occasions Mattie's ill temper always
increased, and he was ready to quarrel on the
least provocation, and especially ready to vent
his ill humour on Ned. As a rule, Coney was
sufficiently sober to protect the boy, but once or
twice it happened—owing to the fact that by
chance the beer was stronger than usual—that
he was too tipsy to do anything but sleep. The
consequence was, that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mattie, working him-
self into a passion for no reason that anybody
could see unless he wanted to get rid of his over-
abundant brutality, flung a pint pot at Ned,
which caught him by the side of the head,
knocked him down, and inflicted a deep cut.</p>
<p>Mattie was rather frightened when he saw Ned
lying on the ground, pale, half unconscious, and
with the blood streaming from his forehead. He
ran to the canal, filled his cap with water, and
dashed it in the boy's face.</p>
<p><said>Get oop,</said> he exclaimed roughly.</p>
<p>Ned struggled to his feet, feeling rather dizzy
and sick. He scarcely knew what had happened,
the assault was so sudden and so unexpected.
There was Coney lying on the grass, with his
face upturned to the sky, and covered with his
cap, snoring heavily. It was of no use, he knew
from previous experience, to appeal to him, for
when Coney was in his cups you might fire off a
cannon close to his ears and not wake him. The
three were by themselves, too, for after coming out
<pb n="148"/>
<fw>Ned's Protest.</fw>
of the beer-house they had wandered a quarter of
a mile or so down the towing-path, and at seven
o'clock in the evening, in an out-of-the-way
country place, the towing-path of a canal is not
a spot where people are likely to be found. But,
in spite of there not being much likelihood of
help, Ned was determined to show that he was
not afraid.</p>
<p><said>What did you hit me for?</said> he asked, when
he had recovered himself a little.</p>
<p><said>Because I chose to,</said> said Mattie, slouching up
to a gate in a low fence which separated the path
from a meadow, and perching himself on the top
rail. <said>Because I chose to,</said> he repeated, <said>and I'll
do it again if you gives me any of your sauce.
And look 'ere, don't you say a word to Coney
'bout this, d'ye hear? or I'll break every bone in
your body.</said></p>
<p>And as he sat there, with his body half doubled
up, and his scowling, ugly face, he looked quite
capable of it.</p>
<p><said>If I was a man do you know what I'd do?</said>
returned Ned, his fists clenched and his teeth set.</p>
<p><said>No, I don't, and what's more, I don't care.</said></p>
<p><said>I wouldn't ask Coney or anybody to fight for
me, but I'd just fling you as far as I could into
the canal, and I'd take good care you didn't come
out again in a hurry.</said></p>
<p><said>What! you murderous young scamp, if you
say much more I'll—</said></p>
<pb n="149"/>
<fw>A Lesson on Apprenticeship.</fw>
<p>But what <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mattie had in his mind he was
not allowed to say, for at that moment the top
rail of the gate, which was a slight one, gave way,
and precipitated him all of a heap into a damp
ditch at the side where there was a plentiful
growth of stinging nettles.</p>
<p>In Mattie's half tipsy condition it was no easy
task for him to rise to his feet again, and as
Ned did not choose to help him, when he did
struggle up his face and wrists were amply sup-
plied with stings, which did not add to his good
temper.</p>
<p>This was only one instance of his brutality, and
as Ned found by experience that it simply made
matters worse to complain to Coney, who, to do
him justice, was ready most times, though not
always, to take his part, he gradually came to say
nothing but to take the blows as part of his canal
training.</p>
<p>Perhaps the men suspected that he might try
to escape, for one day Coney read him a long
lecture about what they could do if he ran away.</p>
<p><said>You're 'prenticed to us, that's what you are.</said></p>
<p><said>But who's 'prenticed me, I should like to
know?</said> replied Ned. <said>I wasn't asked.</said></p>
<p><said>In course you wasn't. We don't ask boys
whether they likes it or not when they're 'pren-
ticed, do we, mate?</said>—this was to Mattie.</p>
<p><said>I should just think we didn't,</said> growled that
worthy. <said>A pretty state things would be in.</said></p>
<pb n="150"/>
<fw>A Desperate Resolve.</fw>
<p><said>It's your uncle as has 'prenticed you to us,
Ned.</said></p>
<p><said>What! Bob Locket?</said></p>
<p><said>Ay. That's him.</said></p>
<p><said>It's a falsehood if he told you he was my
uncle,</said> declared the lad indignantly. <said>He's no
more my uncle than you are. He's my cousin,
that's what he is, and I wish he wasn't.</said></p>
<p><said>I don't know nothing about that. He's paid
us some money to bring you up to the biz-ness,
and we're a-going to do our dooty, eh, Mattie.
What does the law say about it? The law says
if you runs away or don't do as we tells you, you
can be clapped in gaol for a week or so.</said></p>
<p><said>That's so. And you'd better look out, young
shaver,</said> snarled Coney's partner.</p>
<p>Ned did not reply, but he thought if the law
did say so the law was very cruel. He didn't
know much about apprentices, but he believed
that Bob Locket was quite capable of telling an
untruth, and maybe he had imposed upon
Coney.</p>
<p>But what could he do? Here he was, away
from everybody who knew him—indeed, what
friends had he save those at Gibraltar Cottage?—
and who would believe him even if he had a
chance of telling anybody his story. It was hope-
less the more he thought of it. Yet Mattie's
tyranny was making his life intolerable, and get
away he must—a resolution which became very
<pb n="151"/>
<fw>A Plot Overheard.</fw>
much firmer after a certain conversation he had
overheard between the two men.</p>
<p>The boat had nearly completed her loading,
and on the following day they expected to leave
Northampton and proceed on their seemingly
endless journey. Rugby, in Warwickshire, so
Ned found out, was the next town of importance
they would pass, their destination being Bir-
mingham, which they expected to reach in a week
or two's time.</p>
<p>Coney and Mattie had been drinking as usual,
and had finished up the day by bringing some
beer on board the boat. Mattie's first instruction
to the boy was to tell him in his usual rough way
to go to bed, which he accordingly did, going to
bed on board the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Betsy Jane</name> meaning throwing
one's self down on a hard mattress placed on the
top of one of the lockers. But rough as the bed
was, Ned soon went to sleep, and might have slept
soundly till the morning, after his customary
fashion, had he not been awakened by the angry
voices of the men.</p>
<p><said>I tell you I hate him, and I don't see as we're
bound to keep him,</said> he heard Mattie say.
<said>Can't you and me work the boat, Coney? Of
course we can. What's the use of keeping this
youngster as is eating his head off? And then
he'll be wanting wages soon, and who's to pay
him? Are you a-going to do it?</said></p>
<p><said>I ain't got no money as <emph>you</emph> know,</said> answered
<pb n="152"/>
<fw>A Bad Look-out.</fw>
Coney. <said>But I'd like to do the right thing by
the lad if I could.</said></p>
<p><said>If you could,</said> replied Mattie in a contemptuous
tone. <said>You know you <emph>can't</emph>, so what's the use
of talking about it. I tell you what's in <emph>my</emph> mind.
When we gets to Birmingham let's ship him on
the Staffordshire canal. They wants boys there,
they do.</said></p>
<p><said>The Staffordshire canal,</said> thought Ned; <said>why,
that's the canal Buttons was telling me about,
where the boats are leaky old tubs and full of
rats.</said></p>
<p><said>He won't do bad if he gets aboard a <soCalled>fly-
man,</soCalled></said> said Coney reflectively.</p>
<p>The <soCalled>flyman</soCalled> on the Staffordshire canal, it
may be observed, is the best class of boat. It is
worked by a crew of three men, and is by no
means in the wretched condition which the boats
that carry coal and ironstone are.</p>
<p><said>Ah, <q>if.</q> But I ain't <choice><reg>a-going</reg><orig>agoing</orig></choice> to wait till a
<soCalled>flyman</soCalled> turns up just to please this young shaver.
No, no. The first boat as'll take him must have
him. That's what <emph>I</emph> say.</said></p>
<p><said>Some o' them Staffordshire's are cautions and
no mistake. D'ye mind the one as we saw the
last time we was at Birmingham? A bit of a
cupboard to sleep in, and the water a-coming in
through the leaks. Why, Tom Scrowby as worked
in one o' them boats was laid up in the hospital
for a month with ager and roomatics. I ain't
<pb n="153"/>
<fw>An Evil Compact.</fw>
over particular, but I wouldn't go in one of them
ironstone boats, not if you was to pay me double.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, you ain't been asked, so you needn't
fret about it,</said> growled Mattie. <said>They're good
enough for that there Ned of ourn.</said></p>
<p>The boy at this moment shifting his position
attracted Mattie's attention, and he looked up.
Ned. however, remained perfectly still, and his
regular breathing deceived the man, who, think-
ing him to be asleep, went on to persuade Coney
to agree to send him away when they reached
Birmingham.</p>
<p>Coney, Ned could plainly see, was reluctant;
but the idea of saving money was a strong argu-
ment in favour of Mattie's proposition. Ned knew
that to some extent Coney was in the other's
debt. The boatmen sometimes amused themselves
with playing cards, pitch and toss, and occasionally
a dog fight, and Coney had been unlucky of late,
and forced to borrow money from his companion
who was too cautious himself to play or bet.
This, then, was the reason why Coney seemed
inclined to give way though much against his will.</p>
<p>But he held out for a little longer, and Ned
could hear Mattie, in his gruff voice, persuading
him. Then all at once the voices grew low and
indistinct; Ned, through his half closed eyelids,
saw them shaking hands as if concluding a bar-
gain, and the talking ceased. Though he did
not actually hear the words spoken, the boy was
<pb n="154"/>
<fw>Ned Prepares to Run Away.</fw>
certain they had settled the matter, and that as
soon as they arrived at Birmingham he was to be
transferred to another boat.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">But they won't see <emph>me</emph> at Birmingham,</said> mut-
tered Ned to himself. <said aloud="false">I know I can get away
now whenever I like, because they've got tired of
watching me. It won't be long before I'm off
and working my way back to London. It isn't
the first time I've had to look after myself.</said></p>
<p>Full of this idea he lay awake the remainder
of the night endeavouring to form some plan of
escape. Remembering what Coney had said about
the law, and he had no reason to doubt that it
was quite truth, he thought it would be safer if
he made the attempt when the boat was near
some obscure country place. In a big town like
Northampton where could he hide himself? His
former experience told him that the police would
be sure to harry him out of corners and doorways,
whereas in the country he could take refuge in
barns, or, if the worst came to the worst, he could
sleep in the woods or behind a hedge. No, he
would wait until the boat had gone a day or two
on its journey.</p>
<p>The loading of the boat was finished about
eleven in the morning, and the old horse, which
had become quite lively from its long rest, was
brought out and once more the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Betsy Jane</name> pro-
ceeded on its monotonous way. Perhaps it was
the expectation that he was about to get rid of
<pb n="155"/>
<fw>A Chance of Escape.</fw>
Ned that made Mattie positively amiable to the
boy. Not a single cuff did this worthy individual
bestow upon him the whole of that day, which
was really a wonderful thing, for as a rule it was
nothing but hard knocks with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mattie.</p>
<p>But Mattie's alteration of behaviour made no
difference in Ned's resolution. He had made up
his mind to go, and go he would. After thinking
well over the matter, he determined that the most
favourable time to escape would be in the early
morning when he was supposed to be guiding the
horse. One of the men would then be asleep, and
as for the other at the tiller, why the darkness
would prevent him seeing anything. There was
no fear of Jack coming to grief through being left
to himself. Indeed, save when he came to a lock
or met another barge. Jack scarcely needed a
driver, for he had had so many years of canal life
he could walk along the canal bank blindfolded
and never come to grief The only thing Ned
feared was that the barge might come to a lock
before he had time to get clear away; but there
was no way of deciding this, and he must take his
chance.</p>
<p>According to the usual arrangements he had to
turn out of his bed about two in the morning and
take his place on the towing-path. Accordingly
when Coney woke him—or thought he woke him,
for as a matter of fact Ned had not slept a wink
since he laid down—he rose rubbing his eyes and
<pb n="156"/>
<fw>Good-bye to Old Jack.</fw>
yawning to make believe he had been fast asleep
and jumped on shore. He had no valuables or
property which he cared to take with him, so he
had no trouble on that score. All his worldly
possessions were the clothes he had on, an old
knife which a brother bargee, a good-natured fel-
low, had given him, a penny, the present of a lady
whose little girl had dropped a toy in the water
which Ned had picked up, and a piece of bread
that he had saved from his last night's supper.</p>
<p>And with these he had resolved to find his way
to London.</p>
<p>He walked up to the horse and patted his neck.
He was sorry to part from old Jack, for it was
the only thing connected with the canal he really
cared for.</p>
<p><said>I'm off, old fellow,</said> he whispered. <said>If you
want to do me a good turn jog along for a mile
or two without stopping, and that will allow me
to get nicely away.</said></p>
<p>He could almost imagine the horse knew what
he said, for Jack turned his head half round and
picked up his ears sympathizingly.</p>
<p>It was quite dark, and standing where he did,
he could only hear the gentle ripple of the water
caused by the barge, and the splash every now
and then of the tow rope as it slackened and fell
in the water, but he could not see the barge it-
self. Nothing could be more favourable for his
purpose, it seemed to him.</p>
<pb n="157"/>
<fw>A Short Journey.</fw>
<p>A second or two of hesitation, and then he ran
to the fence at the side of the towing-path. He
put his hand up and found he could reach the top.
The next moment he had pulled himself, scrambled
over and dropped without invitation. He alighted
on his feet, and on grass he could feel by its soft-
ness, and then set off running.</p>
<p>He dared not go at the top of his speed for fear
there should be streams of drainage water into
which he might fall with no possible chance of
being rescued. Where the land lies low, as it
does in parts of Northamptonshire, and in Lincoln
and Cambridgeshire, very deep cuttings are made
into which the water drains. These cuttings, or
dykes as they are called, are often as wide as
rivers, and hence Ned had good reason for fear.</p>
<p>He ran for about half a mile as it seemed to
him, and just when he thought he might walk
slower with safety, he heard the sound of a shout.
He knew its tones too well to mistake them. It
was Mattie's voice, and very close it seemed to
be, for he could hear his own name called out,
accompanied by some of Mattie's own choice
language. He stopped and listened. Yes, Mattie
was certainly not far off, for the next thing he
heard was the scrunching of gravel underneath a
heavy foot, which he knew meant that some one
had leaped on to the towing-path.</p>
<p>Yet how could this be? Surely he had run
sufficiently far to make it impossible? Then it
<pb n="158"/>
<fw>Pursuit.</fw>
occurred to him all at once that though he had
started right in the darkness, he had gradually
described a half circle without knowing it, and
so had brought himself back to the canal again.</p>
<p>He scarcely knew what to do. He was sure
his footsteps could not be heard on the soft grass,
but if he moved he might as easily walk in the
wrong direction as in the right. He heard some
one with a heavy tread running up to the horse,
which most likely had stopped, and so had warned
the man at the helm that something was wrong.
Then came more shouts for that <q>rascal Ned,</q>
then more polite language, and then a shout for
Coney.</p>
<p>By-and-by the latter, very sleepy and dis-
agreeable, Ned could tell from his voice, joined
Mattie, and they held a consultation.</p>
<p><said>He ain't drowned, that I'll swear,</said> said Mattie.
<said>D'ye think I shouldn't ha' heard his splash?
Rather. No, he ain't drowned. He's made off,
that's what he's done.</said></p>
<p><said>Then he can't be far away,</said> rejoined Coney.
<said>He hasn't been out more than a quarter of an
hour.</said></p>
<p><said>Of course he hasn't. Get out the lantern.
Quick.</said></p>
<p>During this conversation Ned felt his heart
beat quickly. Still be did not think he ran much
risk owing to the friendly darkness. The men, he
knew, dared not leave their barge for very long,
<pb n="159"/>
<fw>Alone in the Dark.</fw>
and if they fetched a lantern its light would rather
assist him than them, since it would show him
their position and enable him to avoid them.</p>
<p>And so he determined to wait.</p>
<p>In a very short time he saw the light of the
barge lantern. It was at least a couple of a
hundred yards away, and as it moved Ned moved
too, crouching almost close to the ground, so that
his figure should not be seen, for he did not know
how far the light of the lantern extended. Both
Mattie's and Coney's eyes, he knew from past ex-
perience, were good and able to peer a long dis-
tance, and this made him doubly careful.</p>
<p>The lantern moved here and there like a will-
o'-the-wisp, for the figures of both men were
invisible, and it seemed as if its motion were
given to it by ghostly hands. He heard them
growling out their disgust and disappointment,
and then the light began to grow dim and the
voices to die away. Were they going to give up
the search, he asked himself?</p>
<p>Yes, it must be so. Gradually he had, as the
light approached him, gone farther and farther
away from the canal, and he was now so far dis-
tant that, although he could see the glimmer of
the lantern, he could not hear the sounds of the
men's voices. Next the light itself disappeared,
and then he knew the search was over.</p>

<head type="main">Ned Meets with Fresh Friends</head>

<p>Gaining experience from what had just
occurred, Ned thought it would be
more prudent if he waited until day-
light before he started on his journey. It was
very cold standing there in the wet grass, and his
feet, which were not very well shod, were quite
damp; but he did not feel it so much as you or I
would, for his life for the last few weeks had been
a terribly rough one, and he had to some extent
become used to hardships.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait for the faint gray light
in the east which ushers in the day, and then he
was able to take stock of the situation. He found
that remaining quiet had been his best course, for
not fifty yards away was a <soCalled>drain</soCalled> some six feet
wide, and the chances were had he gone on he
would have fallen in.</p>
<p>So far as he could see he was in a flat country,
field after field stretching away on either side.
There was not the vestige of a road or path any-
<pb n="161"/>
<fw>Out in the Fields.</fw>
where to be seen, the land being evidently used
only for pasture. Of course the most direct road
to London, but by no means the nearest—for the
windings of the canal so as to take in the large
towns were interminable—was the towing-path.
But he dared not go this road. He had become
known to the lock-keepers, at least he thought so,
and he might be recognized by some of the boat-
men. Coney's words were still ringing in his ears
as to the power the law had over apprentices, and
he had a vague idea that any boatman who saw
him might hand him over to a policeman and he
would be lodged in prison.</p>
<p>Ned, as we know, had picked up a good deal of
curious information and experience in his wild life
about the streets of Shadwell, but he did not know
much about the law. There had been instilled
into him from a very early age a great dread of
a policeman. The policeman he had come to look
upon as his natural enemy, and he had not grown
out of his fear. So his instinct was to avoid, at
all events at present, the highroads and thorough-
fares where there was any traffic, and keep to the
lanes and by-ways.</p>
<p>To tell the truth he did not feel altogether com-
fortable where he was. He was a trespasser, and
if the owner of the field came by and saw
him how could he account for his being in the
field.</p>
<p><said>I'll get out of it as soon as I can,</said> he muttered;
<pb n="162"/>
<fw>A Long Tramp.</fw>
<said>if I walk on in a straight line I must come to a
road sooner or later. Here goes.</said></p>
<p>And taking a running leap he cleared the six-
foot drain, alighted safely on the other side, and
prepared to trudge along as many miles as might
be necessary. He felt rather hungry, but would
not draw upon his little store of provisions yet
awhile, preferring to hold out as long as he could.</p>
<p>What a terribly long walk it was! Nothing
but field after field, some dry, others perfect
quagmires, obliging him to go many yards out of
his way to skirt the marshy places. <soCalled>Drains,</soCalled>
too, there were in plenty, but none fortunately so
wide but what he could jump them. There was
a singular absence of trees, and those he did see
were of small size. It was certainly not a plea-
sant country for a hungry boy to be lost in.</p>
<p>It was past mid-day before he struck into a lane,
and by this time he had been walking over eight
hours. He was footsore and weary, faint and
hungry. He sat down on a patch of grass by the
roadside, divided his piece of bread into two por-
tions, and ate one, keeping the other for another
meal.</p>
<p>He rested for half an hour, and during the
whole of that time not a soul passed him. He
knew not which way to turn for London, and
when he started he decided the way he should
take by throwing up his penny in the air. If it
came down heads he would go to the right hand,
<pb n="163"/>
<fw>A Suspicious Character.</fw>
if it came down tails he would go to the left. It
came down tails, and so making up his resolution
he went on his way.</p>
<p>After walking a couple of miles or so he found
himself in what he took to be the high road.
There was a finger-post at the junction of the two
roads, and he read on one arm <q>To Market Har-
borough,</q> and on the other <q>To Kettering.</q> Now
had he been well acquainted with the geography
of England he would have taken the road to
Kettering, as it was proceeding almost due south,
and therefore on the way to London. But unless
you have a compass or the sun to guide you, the
north in a strange place may easily be the south
for anything you can tell to the contrary. The
consequence was that Ned would not take the
Kettering road because it looked to him as if he
were going from London and not to it, while as
for Market Harborough he dared not go thither,
because he had heard Coney say the canal ran
through the town. And so, faithful to his fancy
for out-of-the-way roads, he struck up a narrow
lane nearly opposite the one he had not long left.</p>
<p>The first person he met since he started was in
this lane. He was a dark gipsy-looking fellow in
a velveteen coat very white about the seams, and
gaiters. He had a bull-dog with him, which looked
with a remarkably evil eye at Ned.</p>
<p>As Ned passed the man the latter frightened
him considerably by asking him whether he'd
<pb n="164"/>
<fw>Cross-Questioning.</fw>
come from Rothwell. The boy had not the least
idea where Rothwell was, and so he said no, and
was hurrying on when the man detained him,
while the bull-dog with an ominous sniff sat down
on his haunches, growled, and looked up at his
master, as if requesting permission to lay hold of
the stranger s legs.</p>
<p><said>Let's have a look at you,</said> said the man in the
velveteen coat.</p>
<p>Ned was in a state of trepidation, but he re-
turned the look bravely.</p>
<p><said>You're not a Sandham boy?</said> said at last the
man after he had completed his tour of inspection.</p>
<p><said>No, sir.</said></p>
<p><said>I thought you weren't by your talk. Where
do you come from?</said></p>
<p>Ned was puzzled what reply to make. He
dared not say he came from London, because that
would lead to more awkward questions, and how
could he account for his presence so many miles
away in the country? He determined to put a
bold face on the matter. So summing up all his
courage he said: <said>What's that to you, master?</said></p>
<p>Greatly to his relief the man was in no way
offended with his independence.</p>
<p><said>You're right, it's nothing to me. Got any
father or mother?</said></p>
<p><said>Don't know,</said> replied Ned as boldly as before.</p>
<p><said>Don't know, don't you. That's rum; but so
much the better. Hungry?</said></p>
<pb n="165"/>
<fw>A Tempting Offer.</fw>
<p><said>Rather,</said> said the boy. He couldn't help giv-
ing a direct answer to <emph>this</emph> question.</p>
<p><said>Thought so. What d'ye say to a stewed fowl,
eh? Only had her neck twisted at two o'clock
this morning, and as fresh as a daisy.</said></p>
<p>The water came into Ned's mouth at the very
thought. Stewed fowl! Why, it was a dinner fit
for a prince.</p>
<p><said>I should just like some,</said> said he.</p>
<p><said>All right, come along with me then.</said></p>
<p>Ned looked at the man doubtfully. He had had
so many kicks and rough words of late that for
anyone to speak kindly to him did not appear
quite natural. He almost suspected a trick, and
hesitated.</p>
<p><said>What are you afeard of?</said> demanded the man.
<said>I shan't eat you, shall I?</said></p>
<p>No, Ned wasn't afraid of that. Nor did he fear
the man was going to rob him of his solitary
penny. What he was thinking about was the
police. But this fellow, with his loose slouching
gait, his sunburnt dirty face, and his well-worn,
almost ragged clothing, did not look like a police-
man. And then he thought of the stewed fowl.
No, he could not resist that.</p>
<p><said>I'll go with you, master,</said> said he at last.</p>
<p><said>Come on, then. Can you walk pretty quick,
because <emph>I'm</emph> hungry too?</said></p>
<p>Ned limped along valiantly by the man's side,
the dog following behind at his heels; but he was
<pb n="166"/>
<fw>The Caravan.</fw>
so tired, and the blisters on his feet pained him so
much, that he was very glad when, after walking
a half mile or so, the man pointed out some smoke
curling between a clump of trees, on what ap-
peared to be a piece of waste land by the road-
side, and said that was his <soCalled>caravan.</soCalled></p>
<p>And by-and-by they came in sight of the
<soCalled>caravan</soCalled> itself, which was painted yellow, and
had a door with a flight of steps leading down to
the ground. The smoke came from a fire made on
the ground, and over the fire was suspended an iron
pot, which doubtless contained the fowl referred to.</p>
<p>Ned when in London had often seen caravans
of this kind, sometimes as shows, sometimes as the
stalls of <soCalled>cheap Jacks,</soCalled> who always had got the
most wonderful bargains in the way of pocket-
knives and teapots, and sometimes covered all
over with baskets, brooms, brushes, and what not.
These caravans were to him homes of mystery.
They came he knew not whence and went he
knew not where. To live in one of them he had
once thought must be the height of human happi-
ness. But now that he really was going to be
introduced to a caravan he scarcely knew whether
it was so pleasant as he thought.</p>
<p><said>Hallo, Meg!</said> shouted the man.</p>
<p>A middle aged woman, with a face brown as a
berry and hair as black as a coal, put her head
outside the door.</p>
<p><said>Supper ready?</said></p>
<pb n="167"/>
<fw>Something Like a Supper.</fw>
<p><said>Aye, that it is.</said></p>
<p>And she descended the steps and came up to
the man, saying something which Ned did not
understand. But it had to do with him, he was
sure, by the way the woman was looking at his
face all the while she was speaking.</p>
<p>The man answered her in the same strange
language, and then the woman in a not unkind
voice bade him sit down.</p>
<p>While her husband, for Ned judged him so to
be, had gone to fetch a rough-looking pony—whose
coat did not look as if it had been clipped since
the day it was born, so ragged was it—and tether
it up for the night, the woman got the supper
ready, bringing out three tin plates, three iron
spoons, and a loaf of bread.</p>
<p>With what appetite Ned set to work on the
fowl may be easily imagined. It was a little
tough, perhaps, but hunger and sharp teeth were
equal to it.</p>
<p><said>When did you eat last, child?</said> asked the
woman after she had helped him a second time.</p>
<p><said>I've only had a bit of bread all day,</said> said Ned.</p>
<p><said>That's odd, isn't it? How does it come about?
Havn't run away from home, have you?</said></p>
<p><said>No,</said> said Ned stoutly. <said>I want to get home.</said></p>
<p>The woman and the man exchanged looks.</p>
<p><said>And where is your home?</said> asked the man.</p>
<p><said>In London. That's where I want to get to.
Perhaps you could tell me the way?</said></p>
<pb n="168"/>
<fw>Ned Finds Employment.</fw>
<p><said>Why, we're <choice><reg>a-going</reg><orig>agoing</orig></choice> to London,</said> said the
woman. <said>If you like to stop with us you're
welcome, and we can show you the way.</said></p>
<p>Just the very thing thought Ned. But how
was it these people were so kind, that was what
he couldn't make out.</p>
<p><said>I'm much obliged,</said> said he hesitating a little,
<said>but won't it be a trouble to you?</said></p>
<p><said>Not a bit. Will it, Sam?</said></p>
<p><said><emph>I</emph> should think not,</said> replied Sam. <said>If the
boy likes to do as we do, and help us a bit, that's
all we want.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, I'll help you. I'm not afraid to work.
What is it you do?</said> asked Ned, whose tongue the
savoury stew had unloosed. <said>You're gipsies,
aren't you?</said> said he rather timidly.</p>
<p><said>Not quite,</said> said Meg laughing. <said>Half-and-half
like. The country folk think we are, and that's
enough for us. You'll see what we does when we
get to a fair. 'Tisn't hard work, is it, Sam?</said></p>
<p><said>I should rather think it wasn't,</said> returned
Ned's new acquaintance, who had thrown himself
down in front of the fire now that his supper was
over, and was amusing himself with flinging the
bones from his plate to the dog, who crunched
them in his white teeth as if they were so many
sweetmeats. <said>A nice light ockeypation, that's
what it is. Only to pick up sticks.</said></p>
<p><said>Is that all. I could do that <emph>I</emph> know!</said> ex-
claimed Ned.</p>
<pb n="169"/>
<fw>A Snug Berth.</fw>
<p><said>Ah, that you could. You're a lively little chap,
I can see, and ought to be brought up to the
business.</said></p>
<p><said>It's a funny sort of business—picking up
sticks,</said> thought Ned; <said>but I suppose it's for
bundles of firewood.</said></p>
<p><said>It's very kind to take me with you,</said> said he,
<said>and I'll help you all I can.</said></p>
<p><said>That's well. I thought you was the right
stuff.</said></p>
<p>And then Sam, pulling out a short clay pipe as
black as a coal, began to smoke, and Meg, seeing
that Ned looked tired, said he might go to bed if
he liked, a proposal which the boy was glad
enough to accept.</p>
<p>The interior of the caravan was snug enough,
and quite large compared to the cabin. Perhaps
there was not much more room to move about,
but it was much higher, and seemed at first quite
strange to Ned, who had been accustomed in the
cabin to walk with his head bent lest he should
get a nasty knock from striking it against the
ceiling.</p>
<p>The caravan was divided into two portions, so
as to make two little rooms. One was used as a
living-room when the weather was bad—though
the <soCalled>gipsies</soCalled> never used it unless they were
absolutely obliged—and the other as a sleeping
apartment. Like the cabin of the barge there
were lockers and pigeon-holes, but all was dis-
<pb n="170"/>
<fw>On the Way to the Fair.</fw>
order compared with the neat arrangements of
the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Betsy Jane</name>.</p>
<p><said>You can lie down there,</said> said Meg, pointing
to a corner of the sitting-room which was unoccu-
pied by anything, <said>and here's this old blanket.
That'll keep you warm.</said></p>
<p>Thankfully Ned took the blanket, curled him-
self up, and in less than two minutes was sound
asleep.</p>
<p>The next morning he was awakened by a tre-
mendous jolting of the caravan. He was so tired
that it took a good deal of jolting to do it, and
his elbows and knees felt as if they had been
rubbed against something very hard. Slowly he
became aware that the caravan was moving, and
he struggled to his feet, only to be pitched against
the side, for the <soCalled>house on wheels</soCalled> had no springs
and the lane was full of deep ruts.</p>
<p>The riding was so uncomfortable that he was
glad to jump out and join the woman who was
walking behind, while her husband led the ragged
pony. On their way the woman went up to a
farm-house that they passed, and begged a drink
of milk. She brought back about a pint, and
this with bread formed their breakfast, which
they had sitting down on the grass at the road-
side.</p>
<p><said>Have you ever been to a fair?</said> asked <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Hoggins—for this was the name of the worthy
couple—when they were trudging on again.</p>
<pb n="171"/>
<fw>Strange Company.</fw>
<p><said>Yes,</said> said Ned, <said>I've been to Stepney fair,
and I should like to go again.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, we're going to a fair that's every bit as
good as Stepney fair. Better, because there's sheep
and cattle, and you don't get them in London.</said></p>
<p>Ned did not seem particularly impressed with
the attraction of sheep and cattle. But he only
said he hoped there would be shows.</p>
<p><said>Shows! I should just think there would be!
Lasts a fortnight too, though I don't suppose we
shall stop all the time. It all depends what busi-
ness we do.</said></p>
<p><said aloud="false">Business,</said> thought Ned; <said aloud="false">what has picking
up sticks to do with fairs?</said></p>
<p><said>And where is the fair held?</said> he asked.</p>
<p><said>At Stamford,</said> said the woman shortly. <said>It's
all on the road to London.</said></p>
<p>Ned said he was glad to hear that, for he wanted
to get to London as soon as he could.</p>
<p><said>Oh, you'll get there all right; never fear.</said></p>
<p>On the road they fell in with other caravans
all going to the fair. There was the fat lady, the
giant, the dwarf, the sheep with six legs, the wax-
work show, and a host of other sights. Not that
the giant, the dwarf, and the fat lady made their
appearance, for they were getting very near Stam-
ford, and it was necessary they should seek the
seclusion of their own apartments, lest any of the
country people going along the road should see
them.</p>
<pb n="172"/>
<fw>What <soCalled>Picking Up Sticks</soCalled> Meant.</fw>
<p>They reached Stamford after dark, but there
was plenty of life in the <soCalled>fair field,</soCalled> as it was
called. All were busy in making ready for the
morrow, and, with the aid of flaring naphtha
lamps, were engaged in building stages, erecting
booths, and putting up swings. Whatever busi-
ness took Sam and Meg to the fair, it did not
require them to be at work during the night; but
Ned found it difficult to sleep, for the hammering
and sawing and shouting were incessant.</p>
<p>When the morning came it was wonderful to see
what a change had taken place. The caravans, for-
merly closed up, had blossomed out into full-blown
shows, the paintings, showing the attractions to be
seen within (one of which faithfully represented
the Queen and the Prince of Wales standing awe-
struck before the fat lady, who graciously smiled
upon them), were simply wonderful; the owners
of the caravans were dressed out in such gorgeous
attire as to be totally irrecognizable; while the
piles of gingerbread in the stalls were enough to
supply an army.</p>
<p>Sam had got up as soon as it was light, and
Ned found him putting up a sort of canvas fence.
As he proceeded the boy began to see what the
business of picking up sticks meant, and he soon
discovered that it was nothing more nor less than
<soCalled>cockshies.</soCalled></p>
<p><said>That's just what it is,</said> replied Sam; <said>and
all as you've got to do is to pick up the sticks as
<pb n="173"/>
<fw>Sharp Practice.</fw>
the people throw, while I stick the cocoa-nuts on
as they knock off, and Meg she looks after the
money.</said></p>
<p>This division of labour Ned found out was an
excellent one from Sam's point of view, for the
country fellows were not very good marksmen,
and the number of nuts knocked off was very
small compared with the number of sticks thrown.
Sam had certainly the best of it, though what
energy he saved in his legs he made up in his
voice, and his requests to the people to come and
have a try, <q>three sticks a penny,</q> might have
been heard a quarter of a mile away. As for Meg
she had a remarkably keen eye for the money,
and what with looking after the stray pence and
serving out the sticks to the customers she had
enough to do.</p>
<p>And the picking up of sticks? Well, it must
be confessed Ned found it no child's play. In the
morning there was not much to do, for most of
the visitors were women and children; but in the
afternoon, when the half holiday to the farm
labourers round about began, business came in
fast and furious. Ned was kept dancing to and
fro without ceasing for three or four hours. In
spite of his quickness he wasn't able to dodge <emph>all</emph>
the sticks which came spinning through the air,
and his arms, and especially his ankles, were
covered with bruises, while he had had a couple
of nasty knocks on his head. Sam and Meg, too,
<pb n="174"/>
<fw>The Wonderful Shows.</fw>
were not quite so nice as they had been at first,
and if he was not quick enough to suit them they
didn't hesitate to tell him so, and very plainly too.</p>
<p>But he was better off than some of the other
show people, for when it began to grow dark his
work was finished, as it wasn't to be expected
people would throw at cocoa-nuts in the night.
The fair, however, was not nearly over; indeed,
the fun only seemed to begin when the naphtha
lamps were lighted. What a roaring, noisy, push-
ing multitude it was! The merchants who sold
<q>all the fun of the fair,</q> otherwise those ingenious
instruments of torture which when drawn down
the back produce a horribly crawling sensation,
did a thriving trade; for the lasses as well as the
lads were constant customers, indeed, if anything,
the ladies bought more than the gentlemen. The
gingerbread and the toy stalls looked absolutely
brilliant when lighted up, and the gilt on the
former—lifelike representations of cock-a-doodle-
doo, castles, ships, and the like—which was no-
thing better than Dutch metal in broad daylight,
appeared to be of veritable gold at night.</p>
<p>And then the circus, the theatrical booth where
it only took ten minutes to perform a play, so
that the enterprising proprietor managed to secure
at least half a dozen audiences during the evening;
the various <soCalled>wonders,</soCalled> the smallest woman in
the world, the Norwegian giant, the Kaffir who
undertook to swallow unlimited quantities of
<pb n="175"/>
<fw>Wages and Work.</fw>
boiling lead—all were infinitely attractive to Ned,
who was never tired of gazing at the coloured
representations outside, at least on the first even-
ing, when everything was novel and strange.
And when one of the men at the circus, who re-
cognized him as <soCalled>one of us,</soCalled> said he might go in
and see the horse-riding, his joy was supreme.
Never had he before beheld anybody so beautiful
or so clever as Signora Scampi, who leaped through
half a dozen hoops at a time from the back of a
horse going at full speed, and afterwards kissed
her hand to the audience. Indeed, he reproached
himself for his momentary faithlessness to Nellie,
whom he regarded as the prettiest girl in the
world, and was quite glad when the signora hap-
pened to come near him, and he saw she was old,
haggard, and had her face thickly covered with
paint. Still, he enjoyed himself very much, and
was quite sorry when the performance was over.</p>
<p>And when the buzz and the din, the music of
the circus band, the bell and the gong were silent,
he went back to the caravan, and found that the
proprietors of the <soCalled>picking-up-sticks</soCalled> business had
counted up their takings, and having earned more
than they expected, they were pleased to say he
had done very well, and gave him the magnificent
sum of twopence for himself.</p>
<p>One day was very much like another, and at
the end of a week Ned felt himself able to pick
up sticks with any one. He had got quite skilful
<pb n="176"/>
<fw>A Roundabout Way to London.</fw>
in the art of dodging the missiles, and seemed to
know by instinct when they were coming in his
direction even when his back was turned.</p>
<p>In the second week business began to fall off.
All the country people had spent their money,
and the weather turning wet the fair was practi-
cally over. The change made <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sam grumble
fearfully, and at last he declared it was no use
staying any longer and that they'd better be mov-
ing. Accordingly the canvas tent was taken down,
the cocoa-nuts and sticks repacked, and the cara-
van slowly jolted out of Stamford.</p>
<p><said>Where are we going now?</said> asked Ned.</p>
<p><said>Lincoln,</said> said Meg. <said>We've got plenty of time
though, and I daresay we shall stop a night or
two at Grantham, if there's any business about.</said></p>
<p><said>And are we still on the road to London?</said></p>
<p><said>Of course we are. I shouldn't tell you so if
we wasn't, should I?</said></p>
<p>And yet, as London lies due south of Stamford
and Lincoln due north, the route taken was not a
little singular. But Ned did not know this.</p>

<head type="main">The Plot Succeeds</head>

<p>It was a long time before the inmates of
Gibraltar Cottage recovered from the
fright into which they were thrown by
the discovery of the mysterious footsteps. It
would be wrong to say that Jack Grigsby was
frightened, because the old sailor did not know
what fright was, but he was at his wits' end to
know why <emph>his</emph> home should be selected for rob-
bery.</p>
<p><said>If it had been only <emph>one</emph> lubber</said> he ruminated,
<said>I shouldn't ha' thought so much of it. But
<emph>three</emph>—well, it's quite beyond me.</said></p>
<p>For a careful measurement of the footsteps
showed that three men had certainly been in the
garden. The police hadn't a doubt about it, nor
indeed had Jack.</p>
<p><said>Blest if I don't believe as that there cannon-
ball is at the bottom of it all,</said> he soliloquized one
morning, as, after studying his newspaper and
smoking his pipe, he laid the latter down and
<pb n="178"/>
<fw>Jack Grigsby Meditates.</fw>
surveyed the solid globe, which still occupied a
prominent position on the sideboard.</p>
<p><said>What did you say, John?</said> asked his wife,
putting her head inside the door, for she heard
Jack's voice, and knowing no one was in the room
with him, imagined he was calling to her.</p>
<p><said>Why, I was thinking as it was that cannon-
ball as them scoundrels came after the other
night.</said></p>
<p><said>My dear John, what could they do with it if
they did steal it? It's worth nothing.</said></p>
<p><said>That's true; but somehow it's always stuck
in my mind as the cause of everything that's
happened the last six months. Didn't that
Yankee fellow try to rob me of it the very first
time I had it in my hand? Wasn't it through
that ball as we got hold of young Ned (I'd give
something to know where the boy is)? Didn't
that rascal Locket want me to give it him?
Don't tell me as it hasn't got nothing to do with
these circumstarnces, because I say it has.</said></p>
<p>And Jack brought his brown freckled hand
down on the table with a tremendous thump
that made his pipe and his tobacco-jar fairly
dance again.</p>
<p><said>Well, John, if it does you any good to think
so, I've no objection,</said> said the blind woman softly;
<said>only if it is so these men, whoever they are, that
are so anxious to get hold of it, won't be contented
until they have another try.</said></p>
<pb n="179"/>
<fw>Jennie Recommends Patience.</fw>
<p><said>I should just like to see them, that's all,</said>
roared <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby. <said>I'd shoot 'em, that's what
I'd do.</said></p>
<p><said>No, no, you wouldn't.</said></p>
<p><said>I shouldn't, Jennie? And why not? why not,
I say?</said></p>
<p><said>Because, my dear John, you've no firearms
in the house.</said></p>
<p><said>But I can buy a pistol, can't I? I tell you
what, my lass; I think it's time I did. It sha'n't
be said that Jack Grigsby allowed his property to
be taken from him under his very nose. As for
them police they're worse than useless. They
came here and talked very big about what they
were going to do; I gave them a sovereign just
to start 'em on a bit, and what's it all come to?
Nothing.</said></p>
<p>And for once in his life Jack Grigsby really
seemed very angry.</p>
<p><said>Things are going all wrong,</said> he continued
with a sort of desperation, <said>and I don't see how
to set 'em right.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, well, my dear, you must have patience,</said>
said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby in her soothing voice. <said>Now,
if I were you, I'd go out for a stroll. It's a fine
morning and the walk will do you good.</said></p>
<p><said>I don't know but what you're right, old lady.
I've half a mind to steer Limehouse-way and have
a look at that <q>Jolly Waterman</q> where that
fellow Locket lives.</said></p>
<pb n="180"/>
<fw>A Visit to <q>The Jolly Waterman.</q></fw>
<p><said>Yes, but pray don't lose your temper if you
do come across <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket.</said></p>
<p><said>Lose my temper, indeed!</said> returned Jack with
indignation. <said>You don't often see me lose my
temper?</said></p>
<p><said>No, <emph>I</emph> don't, but I think other people some-
times do,</said> replied the old lady with a smile.</p>
<p><said>Ah! but not without cause, Jennie.</said></p>
<p><said>Of course not, Jack. I know you too well
for that.</said></p>
<p>Whereupon <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby expressed himself satis-
fied, and promised, if he did come across the objec-
tionable <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket, to speak fair; that was, of
course, if he received no provocation.</p>
<p><said>Do you know what I have been thinking,
John?</said> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby, while the pilot was
struggling into his great-coat.</p>
<p><said>No; how should I?</said></p>
<p><said>Well, it occurs to me that as you're going to
the <q>Jolly Waterman</q> you might see <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Locket
if you did not happen to see her husband. Now
if you could do that, and just questioned her a
little, cautiously you know, you might find out
what <emph>she</emph> has to say about the boy's supposed
death. If their stories didn't agree, why either
one or the other must be telling a falsehood, and
if so I should think Bob Locket would be far more
likely to be untruthful than his wife.</said></p>
<p><said>That's a good idea, Jennie, and no mistake!</said>
exclaimed Jack in admiration. <said>I'll do that if
<pb n="181"/>
<fw>A Curious Discovery.</fw>
I have to wait half the day. Bob Locket will
find I'm his match in artfulness before long.</said></p>
<p>Which was very consoling to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, who
quite forgot that it was his wife's suggestion and
not his.</p>
<p>When he had gone <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby set about her
household duties, part of which was the dusting
of the thousand and one curiosities in the little
parlour. In <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's seafaring days he never
went a voyage without bringing back some rarity.
Ivory fans from China, curious carvings from
India, bows and arrows from New Zealand, stuffed
birds from South America, and pipes from every
quarter of the globe, were only a few of the curio-
sities which were orderly ranged in that wonder-
ful parlour. But the most wonderful thing was
that the blind woman never allowed any one to
dust any of them but herself. She knew the
place of every individual treasure, and could tell
when the smallest had been shifted from its ac-
customed position. Her light fingers moved harm-
lessly over them, and her touch was so sensitive
that she could almost tell by the feel when an
article had dust upon it.</p>
<p>This morning, as we have said, she proceeded
to dust as usual, and in due time came to the
memorable cannon-ball. As she passed her hands
over the surface—for touch to some extent filled
the place of sight, and it was a pleasure every
morning to feel the outline of the various objects
<pb n="182"/>
<fw>The Lockets Have Disappeared.</fw>
in the room, objects she knew the shape of quite
well, though she had never seen them—she was
conscious of an unevenness in the metal she had
never noticed before. This unevenness took the
form of a circular ridge, as if a portion of the
metal was higher than the rest.</p>
<p>Whatever <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby may have thought
about this discovery, which after all was a trifling
one, she said nothing about it to Nellie, but waited
until her husband came home, which he did much
sooner than she expected.</p>
<p><said>You have not seen <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Locket, then,</said> said
she before he had time to say a word, for with
the marvellous perception which most blind
people have, she detected something of disappoint-
ment in his very footstep.</p>
<p><said>Not seen her? No, that I havn't, nor him
neither. The house is shut up, my dear.</said></p>
<p><said>Shut up!</said> echoed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby.</p>
<p><said>Aye. I found out after a bit as there'd been
a lot of complaints about Locket. Bad characters
used to go to the house, and the police began to
suspect Locket himself, so the magistrates took
away his licence. Well, after that he couldn't
keep the place open, and so he's gone no one
knows where. And that's all I've got to tell you.</said></p>
<p>With which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby sat down with quite
a blank look on his honest face.</p>
<p>His wife said nothing of the subject which had
filled her thoughts all the morning until dinner
<pb n="183"/>
<fw>A Secret Experiment.</fw>
was over and Nellie had gone to school. Then
she told him about the discovery she had made
on the surface of the cannon-ball.</p>
<p>The result of her communication was the bring-
ing of the cannon-ball on the table, and a minute
examination on the part of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, in which
examination a gimlet and a small chisel were
brought into great request. As the pilot had
taken the precaution to lock the door while the
examination was going on, I am not able to say
what he found, but I know this that in about an
hour's time <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby ran hastily <emph>out</emph> of the
house, returned with a cab, rushed <emph>into</emph> the house,
came out again with his well-known travelling bag
heavily laden, got into the vehicle and dashed off.</p>
<p>He was absent another hour, and when he re-
turned there was every sign of satisfaction on his
weather-beaten countenance.</p>
<p><said>Well, that's safe, my dear,</said> he whispered,
rubbing his hands.</p>
<p>And for two whole days the cannon-ball was
absent from its accustomed place, but on the third
it reappeared, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby dusted it rever-
ently every morning as before.</p>
<p>One thing, however, was noticeable, and this
was that Jack Grigsby seemed day by day to
grow more convinced that the thieves would try
a second time to break into his house. He did
not, of course, say a word to his granddaughter
about his fears, but he often talked over the
<pb n="184"/>
<fw>Watching for Thieves.</fw>
matter with his wife. Indeed he at last became
so certain that the attempt would be made that
he sent Nellie away into the country to stay with
some friends, bought a pistol as he declared he
would, and very often sat up in the <choice><reg>bedroom</reg><orig>bed-room</orig></choice> at
night, and kept watch in the dark.</p>
<p>But the days went by and so did the nights,
and nothing happened. Jack had made so cer-
tain of their coming that he was positively dis-
appointed, and he actually began to grumble at
what he called his bad luck.</p>
<p><said>Why trouble any more about it?</said> asked his
wife.</p>
<p><said>Because I should like to catch the scoundrels.
Havn't I laid out fifteen shillings in a revolver?
It's too bad after spending the money to find as
it isn't wanted.</said></p>
<p><said>Which I sincerely hope it won't be. If they
do come let them take what they like so long as
they don't harm us.</said></p>
<p><said>That's all very well, but I want to trap 'em
besides, d'ye see, Jennie.</said></p>
<p>And so Jack continued his watch, which he
was able to do uninterruptedly, for he had retired
from the profession of piloting ships, his old com-
rade's ship the <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good Fortune</name> being almost his
last commission.</p>
<p>But he gradually grew lax, and began to think
of having Nellie home, for it certainly appeared
as if the robbers he expected were not coming.</p>
<pb n="185"/>
<fw>The Cannon-ball Stolen at Last.</fw>
<p>And so from watching every night he took to
watching just when the fit seized him, which
perhaps was two or three times a week.</p>
<p><said>I think I'll turn in to-night,</said> said he one
evening, when after supper he had fallen asleep
in his arm-chair. <said>I feel quite done up.</said></p>
<p>Accordingly he went to bed a little earlier than
usual, and slept so soundly that the screaming of
Hannah, the rosy-cheeked serving-maid about
seven o'clock the next morning, and the entreaties
of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby that he would get up, failed for
a long time to wake him.</p>
<p>When he did he jumped out of bed with much
more activity than one would imagine he could
have shown; struggled with his trousers, which
of course, as he was in a hurry, <emph>would</emph> get twisted
and tangled, and finally half dressed rushed down-
stairs.</p>
<p>He wasn't away more than a minute before
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby heard him racing upstairs.</p>
<p><said>Old lady,</said> he cried bursting into the room,
<said>they've done it this time. The cannon-ball's
gone!</said></p>
<p>Yes, it was stolen, and the loss must certainly
have turned poor Jack Grigsby's brain; for, instead
of groanings and lamentations coming from his
mouth, he sat down in a chair and laughed till
his sides ached again!</p>

<head type="main">Ned Hears Strange News</head>

<p>We are once more at the old cathedral
city of Lincoln. The streets are for
once positively crowded, and the
shopkeepers are almost lively, for it is fair time,
and the country people for miles round have
trooped in, some to sell their sheep and cattle,
others to make purchases, and others to see the
sights. One country fair is a great deal like an-
other, so that I need not say very much about
the fair itself. To Ned the novelty had gone off,
and even if his work of picking up the cocoa-nut
sticks had not kept him fully employed, he would
not have spent much time in the fair itself, but
would have preferred to ramble about the streets.</p>
<p>Now Lincoln fair begins on the 24th of April
and lasts for four days; and it so happened in
this particular year that Sunday fell on the 26th
so that there was an interval, when of course no
business was done. Ned had thus the day to
himself.</p>
<pb n="187"/>
<fw>Ned in Lincoln Cathedral.</fw>
<p>Wandering about the city in the morning he
noticed that all the church-going people were
streaming in one direction towards the cathedral.
<said aloud="false">I wonder what a cathedral's like inside!</said> he
thought.</p>
<p>Then he looked at his travel-stained clothes,
and the fine dresses of the ladies, and the well-
brushed coats and trousers of the gentlemen, and
shook his head.</p>
<p><said>I suppose they'd turn me out,</said> he muttered.</p>
<p>But the bells from the tower sounded so sweetly
he couldn't help staying and listening. They
seemed to draw him on, and gradually he ascended
the hill leading to the cathedral, and at last found
himself outside the porch as Great Tom—the
largest bell in the famous peal of Lincoln cathe-
dral—was striking ten o'clock. Soon he heard
the solemn yet sweet tones of the organ, and he
crept inside the porch. Then came, as he thought,
the most beautiful sounds he had ever heard in
his life, the singing of the choir. He felt spell-
bound, for it seemed to him the voices were more
like those of angels than of men and boys.</p>
<p>He could no longer resist the influence of the
place. He stole softly in, and looked up wonder-
ingly at the high vaulted roof, the pillars and the
carvings. One of the vergers glanced severely
and suspiciously at him as if he was not quite
sure so shabby a looking boy should be admitted,
but he said nothing, and Ned made his way to
<pb n="188"/>
<fw>A Gentle Nap.</fw>
some benches where a number of people were sit-
ting. There was room for him next to a woman
who had her head bent down studying her prayer-
book, and he sat down a little distance from her.</p>
<p>For a time the stillness, broken only by the
voice of the clergyman and the responses of the
people, had a strangely soothing effect upon him.
Perhaps it was all the more noticeable because
for the last two days he had lived amid an inces-
sant din and turmoil. However, whether this
was so or not it was very pleasant, he thought,
to be in that peaceful place, and he was very glad
he had come.</p>
<p>He did not know very much about the church
service; but had he been in the habit of going to
church all his life, he could not have behaved
better. Keeping a watch upon the people round
about him, he rose when they did, sat down when
they did, and knelt when they did. But when
the sermon came his vigilance was fairly over-
come. Where he was sitting was outside what is
called the <soCalled>choir</soCalled>—a portion of the cathedral set
apart for the service, and separated from the main
body by great gates. So far away was he from
the preacher, and so subdued was the preacher's
voice, that after nodding several times, and re-
covering himself just at the point when he was
in danger of falling off his seat, Ned gradually
subsided into the most delicious sleep he had ever
experienced.</p>
<pb n="189"/>
<fw>Forty Winks.</fw>
<p>As a rule the verger of a cathedral, or for the
matter of that the beadle of a church, has a very
decided opinion that to sleep while the sermon is
being preached is a most dreadful crime. In a
grown-up person it is bad enough, but in a boy
or a girl it is abominable. Accordingly it was
not long before <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Giles Scroggins, the head ver-
ger at Lincoln Cathedral, and a most important
person in his way, spied out the unfortunate Ned,
and pounced down upon him as a spider pounces
on a fly.</p>
<p>Unconscious of the approach of the enemy, Ned
was in the middle of a most delightful dream,
wherein he saw himself once more at Stepney
playing with Nellie in Jack Grigsby's back gar-
den. He thought he was digging his playmate's
flower-bed, when suddenly the wooden admiral,
with a look of anger on his usually amiable face,
lifted his arm and brought it down on Ned's head
with tremendous force.</p>
<p>The next thing Ned felt was a hand laid on his
collar, and himself being dragged he didn't know
exactly where. Finally having by this time be-
come thoroughly awake, he was made aware of
the crime he had committed.</p>
<p><said>If you can't behave yourself you'd better get
out,</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Scroggins in a hoarse voice. <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Scroggins was a dark-featured individual with
huge black whiskers just turning gray, black eye-
brows which stuck out as if they were always
<pb n="190"/>
<fw>Ned is <soCalled>Run Out</soCalled> of Church.</fw>
being brushed the wrong way, and a red nose of
the kind which is known as of the <soCalled>bottle</soCalled>
shape, and he looked so formidable that the boy
was positively frightened.</p>
<p><said>I haven't done anything,</said> he ventured to say.</p>
<p><said>Don't let me catch you here again, that's all,</said>
was the only answer <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Scroggins deigned to
give.</p>
<p>Naturally the little incident attracted some
attention, for the good people, who could no more
hear the sermon than could Ned, and also I dare-
say had felt quite as sleepy as he did, were glad of
something to look at. Ned, consequently, with
one side of his face burning and red from the
rousing slap with which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Scroggins had hon-
oured him, and which in his dream he had attri-
buted to the admiral, felt exceedingly awkward,
and ruefully picking up his cap prepared to get
away as soon as he could.</p>
<p>So with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Scroggins marching solemnly
behind, and keeping his eyes fixed upon the de-
linquent lest he should be inclined to be rebellious,
Ned went out feeling extremely like a criminal.</p>
<p>Now it so happened that Ned was not the only
one who quitted the cathedral at this moment.
The woman near whom he had been sitting, and
who like the rest had turned to see what was the
matter, had risen after the boy had been so igno-
miniously expelled and had followed him out.</p>
<p>Ned was walking away feeling very indignant
<pb n="191"/>
<fw>An Old Acquaintance.</fw>
at his treatment, when he felt a hand laid on his
shoulder. He at once thought it was a fresh out-
rage on the part of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Scroggins, and he turned
round determined, now that he was no longer
inside the building, not to submit to any more
bullying.</p>
<p>To his surprise it was not the verger, but the
woman who had been sitting on the same bench
with him. He had not taken much notice of her
while in the cathedral, for his attention had been
too much occupied with the service, but now they
were face to face he uttered a joyful cry of re-
cognition.</p>
<p>It was Ann Locket, the wife of his cousin Bob
Locket.</p>
<p><said>Why, Ann, I never expected to see you.</said></p>
<p><said>Nor I you, dear.</said></p>
<p>The woman was paler and more faded than
when Ned last saw her at the <q>Jolly Waterman.</q>
Indeed she looked so thin and wasted that Ned,
young as he was, could see that she was very ill.</p>
<p><said>Come here, Ned,</said> she whispered, <said>I want to
talk to you.</said></p>
<p>She looked round with quite a frightened
glance, and led the wondering boy to an unfre-
quented part of the cathedral close.</p>
<p><said>Tell me, my dear,</said> said she, <said>have you come
here with Bob?</said></p>
<p><said>Come here with Bob?</said> repeated the boy in
astonishment. <said>Of course I haven't.</said></p>
<pb n="192"/>
<fw>Meg and Sam Are Found Out.</fw>
<p><said>Then you do not know he is at Lincoln?</said></p>
<p>At Lincoln! How extraordinary that chance
should have brought him to the same place as his
cousin, the man whom of all others in the world he
most feared to meet.</p>
<p><said>No,</said> he replied. <said>I have not heard anything
about Bob since he had me taken away. Some
day Bob and me'll meet, and I'll pay him out for
all his cruelty. You'll see if I don't.</said></p>
<p><said>Hush, dear! Bob is a very wicked man, but
he is my husband, worse luck. Don't let us talk
of him just now. Tell me about yourself, and
what you have been doing. You have grown
such a fine big strong fellow, no wonder I did not
know you when you were sitting in the cathedral.</said></p>
<p>And this was the fact. Living almost entirely
in the pure air of the country for the last few
weeks, and working hard all the time, had won-
derfully improved Ned's stature and strength; and
Ann, who last saw him when he was pale and
thin from confinement and semi-starvation, was
not far from the truth when she said she did not
know him.</p>
<p>Of course he had a great deal to tell, and the
woman listened attentively to the story of his
adventures. But when he wound up with saying
that he had remained with his friends Meg and
Sam because they were going to London, she
smiled.</p>
<p><said>They've been imposing on you, Ned, if they
<pb n="193"/>
<fw>A Bitter Enemy.</fw>
told you that. Why, ever since you've been with
them they've been travelling <emph>away</emph> from London.</said></p>
<p><said>What! isn't Lincoln on the road to London,
then?</said></p>
<p><said>Of course it is if you go back all the way you
came, through Grantham and Stamford.</said></p>
<p>Ned was so enraged at the trick played on him
that for a few moments he could not speak.</p>
<p><said>It is too bad!</said> at last he cried. <said>I can see
now what they've done. They wanted me to
work for 'em for next to nothing, and I suppose
they thought I wouldn't have joined them if I
hadn't believed they were going to London.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, dear, there are more ways than one of
getting to London. You mustn't stop in Lincoln,
that's certain, for you are not safe here.</said></p>
<p><said>Not safe, Ann? Why, what is there to be
afraid of?</said></p>
<p><said>Didn't I tell you that Bob was here? Ah! you
don't know what he's capable of. He hates you,
and—but I dare not, no, I dare not tell you any
more. You must go away at once, Ned. I would
not have Bob find out you were here for worlds.</said></p>
<p>Ned was confounded, stupefied. He could
not understand why his cousin should hate him
so. And it was something more than an ordinary
hatred too, for, as he had gathered from what he
overheard the canal boatmen Mattie and Coney
saying. Bob had paid them five pounds to take
him away, and Bob, he knew well, was not the
<pb n="194"/>
<fw>Bob Locket is at the Fair.</fw>
man to spend five pounds unless he had a very
good reason for so doing.</p>
<p><said>And why is Bob in Lincoln?</said> he presently
asked.</p>
<p><said>Don't you know that his mother and <emph>your</emph>
aunt lives here?</said></p>
<p><said>My aunt! I never knew I had an aunt.</said></p>
<p><said>Ah! it's a long time since she's seen you. She's
cross and sour in her manner, but she's got a good
heart. I must take you to her, Ned. Poor thing,
she's had a lot to try her. Things have been very
bad with us, Ned, since you were sent away. It
seems like a judgment on us, that it does. We
had to shut up the <q>Jolly Waterman,</q> and without
a farthing in my pocket, for Bob had gone off I
don't know where, I had to beg my way down
here to Bob's mother. She was the only one I
could turn to. Well, I hadn't been here a week
before we had a letter from Bob, saying he'd gone
into partnership with two friends, and he was
coming down to the fair.</said></p>
<p>All this was wonderful news, but it did not ex-
plain to Ned why his cousin hated him. It was
curious, he thought, that he had not met Bob at
the fair, but no doubt this was owing to the fact
that both had been too busy to go far from the
spots where their business was being carried on.</p>
<p><said>And what line is Bob in?</said></p>
<p><said>Something to do with shooting and conjuring,
but I don't exactly know. He tells me he is mak-
<pb n="195"/>
<fw>A Secret Visit Proposed.</fw>
ing money, but <emph>I</emph> don't get any of it, nor his mother
either.</said></p>
<p><said aloud="false">Shooting and conjuring!</said> thought the boy. <said aloud="false">I
must keep a sharp look-out for the shooting-gal-
leries and the conjuring booths.</said></p>
<p><said>You said just now, Ann, there were more ways
of getting to London than one. I wish you'd tell
me how to do it. I <emph>must</emph> go back to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby.
He'll think I'm the most ungrateful chap in the
world. But you know I'm not, am I?</said></p>
<p>Ann thought for a moment and then said, <said>If
your aunt liked she could pay for you to go to
London by the train. It will be such a surprise
for her when you come, for she doesn't know
whether you're alive or dead.</said></p>
<p><said>And when shall I come?</said></p>
<p><said>To-night after dark. If you see a light in the
window you will know that Bob is not there, and
you may safely knock.</said></p>
<p><said>Very well, I will come; but you haven't told
me where the house is.</said></p>
<p>Ann described as well as she could, the quaint
house built in the old abbey wall, and Ned having
already noticed it because of its singular appear-
ance, there was little fear of his making a mistake,
and so, after imploring him to be careful and keep
a good look-out for Bob Locket, the woman went
away, leaving Ned pondering over the strange
intelligence he had just heard.</p>

<head type="main">Ned Meets his Aunt</head>

<p><said aloud="false">I wish I knew why Bob hated me,</said> he
thought as he walked slowly back to
the fair. But all the thinking in the
world couldn't solve this problem, and after
puzzling his brains to no purpose he gave it
up.</p>
<p>He had to own that he was very glad when he
was safely inside the caravan. All the way from
the cathedral he was fearful lest he should come
across his cousin, and especially so when he got to
the fair. But though he saw nothing of him he
did not feel at all relieved, for it seemed scarcely
possible they could be so close together and not
at some time happen to meet each other.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was this thought that made him
look rather grave, for Meg, when she had finished
disclosing the mysteries of a beef-steak pudding
which formed their dinner, inquired what was
the matter.</p>
<p><said>Nothing,</said> said Ned.</p>
<pb n="197"/>
<fw>Ned Asks an Awkward Question,</fw>
<p><said>Don't you tell me that, boy. I can see through
a millstone as well as most people. If you ain't
satisfied why don't you say so?</said> said she in her
rough voice.</p>
<p><said>What's the good of rowing when a fellow's
having his dinner?</said> inquired Sam, whose respect
for his meals was intense, he being blest with an
appetite which was one of the heartiest.</p>
<p><said>Who's a rowing?</said> retorted his wife. <said>What
I say is this—that if there's dissatisfaction let's
know what it is.</said></p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances what Meg said
on such an occasion would not have mattered to
Ned. She was of a querulous disposition, and
<soCalled>getting up</soCalled> the dinner, as she called it, always
tried her temper. But now that he knew she and
her husband had been deceiving him, he was rather
disposed to take advantage of her fault-finding to
disclose his grievance.</p>
<p><said>Well,</said> said he suddenly, <said>if you want to know
the truth I'll tell you. When I came to live with
you, didn't you say to me that you were going to
London?</said></p>
<p>The man looked at the woman and the woman
looked at the man. They knew what was coming;
<emph>that</emph> was evident. But Sam wasn't to be taken
aback so easily.</p>
<p><said>And so we are,</said> he growled out. <said>We ain't
going there direct, p'raps, but we can't afford to
throw away money. If this fair hadn't come off
<pb n="198"/>
<fw>and Makes a Startling Statement.</fw>
just now we should ha' been on the road to London
by this time. Shouldn't we, Meg?</said></p>
<p><said>Of course we should,</said> replied Meg. <said>We've
kept our part of the bargain, anyway,</said> she added
in a tone implying it was not altogether certain
that Ned had kept his.</p>
<p>But in spite of their assertions the boy knew
they were deceiving him. Only two days ago Meg
had said something about going on to York, which,
he now knew, was still further north. But he did
not think it worth while to refer to this.</p>
<p><said>Well,</said> said he, <said>anyway, if you don't mind, I
think we'd better part.</said></p>
<p>Ned's announcement came like a thunderbolt
upon the couple. Sam laid down his knife and
fork and stared blankly at the lad.</p>
<p><said>Well,</said> he ejaculated, <said>if that ain't the most
ungratefullest thing as I ever heard tell on. Here
we've fed you and lodged you for weeks, and you
turns round and says you want to go.</said></p>
<p><said>I'm very sorry,</said> began Ned.</p>
<p><said>Sorry!</said> repeated Meg indignantly. <said>What's
the use of being sorry? Where are we to get
another boy at a moment's notice?</said></p>
<p>Ned thought to himself, if they did get another
boy to work as he had done for twopence a day
they would be extremely lucky; but he did not
say so.</p>
<p><said>Oh! I'll stay till the fair's over, of course,</said> he
answered.</p>
<pb n="199"/>
<fw><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hoggins is Sarcastic.</fw>
<p><said>Oh, will you? Come, now, that's mighty per-
lite and condescending, 'pon my word,</said> rejoined
Sam in an ironical tone. <said>And suppose we don't
ask you to stay?</said></p>
<p><said>Oh! that's all nonsense, Sam,</said> put in his wife
impatiently. <said>He'll have to stay whether he likes
it or not, over to-morrow. You're a young stupid
thing, Ned, to give up such friends as we've been
to you.</said></p>
<p>Ned was of a different opinion, but he did not
care to argue the point. In their way Meg and
Sam had been kind to him, but then he had
worked for them, and was certainly under no
obligation.</p>
<p><said>And what are you going to do?</said> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Hoggins after a pause.</p>
<p><said>I'm going to London, as I told you. I've
found some friends in Lincoln who may help me.</said></p>
<p><said>Friends in Lincoln!</said> returned Meg curiously;
<said>and who may they be?</said></p>
<p><said>Oh! somebody I knew a long time ago,</said> he
replied. He did not think it necessary to explain
very precisely; indeed it occurred to him imme-
diately after she asked the question that he had
acted rather unwisely in telling her he knew any-
body in Lincoln. Supposing Meg or Sam met his
cousin, and nothing was more likely, the whole
affair would come out.</p>
<p><said>You're precious close, my young gentleman,</said>
said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hoggins with a short laugh.</p>
<pb n="200"/>
<fw>A Visitor to Sam Hoggins.</fw>
<p>She tried him with a few more questions, but
he was not to be drawn out, and so at last she
desisted.</p>
<p>All that afternoon Ned remained in the cara-
van, being, in fact, afraid to venture out until
nightfall. When evening approached he slipped
away, however, and took the direction leading to
his aunt's house.</p>
<p>He had scarcely been gone half an hour before
a man with a hang-dog look and a slouching gait
came lounging by, and accosted <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sam Hoggins
as he sat on the steps of his caravan smoking a
pipe.</p>
<p><said>Good evening!</said> said the stranger.</p>
<p>Sam nodded in response. He was not a man of
many words, and the civilities of life were with
him reduced to their very lowest terms.</p>
<p><said>You don't know me, I dare say. I've got the
next pitch to yours, t'other side of your canvas
there.</said></p>
<p><said>What! the shootin'-gallery?</said> returned Sam.</p>
<p><said>Aye.</said></p>
<p><said>You ain't been long in the line, have you? I
don't know your face, and I know most of 'em as
comes to the eastern counties.</said></p>
<p><said>Ah! that's where it is. I've been travelling
in the west—Bath, Bristol, Wells, and them parts.
But I've gone in partnership, and we thought we'd
try the east.</said></p>
<p><said>Business pretty brisk?</said></p>
<pb n="201"/>
<fw><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket on the Look-out for Ned.</fw>
<p><said>Fairly tidy. The people have spent all their
money though. We're off to-morrow morning.</said></p>
<p><said>Are you, though?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, and that's what brought me round to see
you. I've been noticing a boy as you've got with
you. Now, that boy—</said></p>
<p><said>Hold hard there, mate. My missis must be
brought into this. Hallo, Meg!</said></p>
<p>In response to the summons <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hoggins made
her appearance at the door of the caravan, dressed
in quite a gala costume, consisting of a bright pink
cotton dress, with a still brighter yellow handker-
chief on her shoulders.</p>
<p><said>Here's some one come about that boy, Meg,</said>
said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hoggins, taking his pipe out of his
mouth and pointing with it to the stranger.</p>
<p><said>Well,</said> said the lady, <said>and what about him?</said></p>
<p><said>Nothing particular. Only I recognize him as
a bad lad as it's my misfortune to be related to.
No one knows what I've done for that boy.</said></p>
<p>This was more true than the speaker would have
cared to own. The visitor, as my readers may
have guessed, was Bob Locket, and as he had
never done anything for Ned but what was bad,
no wonder he kept it to himself.</p>
<p><said>He run away from one of the best homes, and
he's given me more trouble than I can tell you,</said>
resumed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket.</p>
<p><said>Well, he do seem rather ungrateful,</said> replied
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hoggins, mindful of her own remark at the
<pb n="202"/>
<fw>Quite Overcome With Admiration.</fw>
dinner-table. <said>He wants to leave <emph>us</emph>, and I'm
sure he can't say as <emph>we've</emph> ever been unkind to
him.</said></p>
<p><said aloud="false">Oh, wants to leave, does he!</said> thought Bob;
<said aloud="false">then I've come just in time.</said></p>
<p><said>Might I ask, ma'am, how you came to meet
him?</said> said he aloud.</p>
<p>Upon which Sam told how he came across Ned
near Rothwell in Northamptonshire, footsore and
weary, and how he suspected the boy had run
away from somewhere.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">I thought I couldn't trust those bargees,</said> mut-
tered Locket to himself. <said aloud="false">He's given them the
slip, that's plain.</said></p>
<p><said>What did you say, guv'nor?</said> asked Sam.</p>
<p><said>I was saying to myself as it must have been
soon after he run away from me that he met you,</said>
returned <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket.</p>
<p><said>Wery likely. Well, I suppose as you wants
him back?</said></p>
<p><said>It's only because I don't like to see him go to
rack and ruin. I promised his poor father as I'd
look after him, and so I will.</said></p>
<p>Really the goodness of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket was surpris-
ing. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hoggins was quite overcome by it.</p>
<p><said>You're a right good sort, that you are. If it
was me now I'd pack him off, bag and baggage.
I suppose, then, as you wants to take him with
you?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, but you'd better not say a word to him.
<pb n="203"/>
<fw>A Good Evening's Work.</fw>
The boy's that artful he'd be off before you could
say Jack Robinson.</said></p>
<p><said>Would he though? What a young weasel!</said></p>
<p><said>I should think he was. Now, look here, we're
a going away to-morrow night just after dark.
I'll look in here about eight o'clock, and take him
by surprise. Do you see?</said></p>
<p>Sam nodded.</p>
<p><said>And here—I daresay you've been put to some
expense over him—take this.</said></p>
<p>And he held out five shillings.</p>
<p><said>Well, I'm sure it's very kind of you, not but
what we have spent something over him; still—
well, thank ye.</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hoggins would have been more than human
had he resisted the sight of the money.</p>
<p><said>I'll look in, then, about eight o'clock to-mor-
row. Good night!</said> said Locket, turning on his heel.</p>
<p><said>Well, missis, it hasn't been a bad turn-out for
us meeting with the young scamp,</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hog-
gins, reflectively. <said>It isn't everybody as would
have done what his relation has just done.</said></p>
<p><said>I suppose not,</said> returned Meg; <said>but I tell
you what, I don't believe all that fellow said.
There's too much soft soap about him for me.</said></p>
<p><said>That isn't our business. The boy was bound
to go, whether we liked it or not, to-morrow.
We hadn't any right to keep him.</said></p>
<p>And so, on the whole, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hoggins was well
pleased with his evening's work.</p>
<pb n="204"/>
<fw>A Grim Welcome.</fw>
<p>If <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hoggins could have heard <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Locket's
soliloquy as he slowly strolled away towards his
own booth, she would have been more than ever
justified in her estimate of his character.</p>
<p>Directly he had turned his back the smooth
look departed from his face, and his natural evil
expression took its place.</p>
<p><said>I'll get rid of him this time for good,</said> he mut-
tered between his teeth. <said>I'll have him under
my own eye, and he'll be clever if he ever gets
away from me. I've got a plan for you, my young
gentleman, better than the canal-boats. I'll take
you up to Hull or Grimsby, and 'prentice you
to the skipper of a fishing smack. That'll suit
<emph>your</emph> book, I'll warrant.</said></p>
<p>And he laughed an evil, grating laugh that
made his face look uglier than ever.</p>
<p>In the meantime Ned had made his way to his
aunt's. As soon as he got near enough he saw
the light—a feeble glimmer it was certainly—
promised by Ann, supposing all was safe.</p>
<p>He went up the well-worn stone steps and
knocked softly. The door was opened imme-
diately by Ann.</p>
<p><said>It's all right, Ned,</said> said she. <said>We haven't
seen him to-day, and I don't think he'll come now.</said></p>
<p>Ned went into the room, and saw sitting by a
little fire a gaunt, bony woman with a thin, pale,
worn face.</p>
<p><said>Come here, my boy,</said> said she directly she saw
<pb n="205"/>
<fw>Ned Hears of Jack Grigsby.</fw>
Ned. Her voice, he thought, was not nearly so
harsh as her face.</p>
<p>He went up to her, and she put her hand on
his shoulder and drew him to her, looking ear-
nestly into his face.</p>
<p><said>Yes,</said> she murmured, <said>you've got Sam's eyes.
Do you know me?</said> she asked.</p>
<p><said>You're my aunt,</said> answered Ned; <said>but I
never saw you before.</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, yes, you have. It's a long while ago,
though. And so you've made some friends in
London?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, and I want to get back to them—that is
if you don't mind, aunt.</said></p>
<p><said><emph>I</emph> mind! Not I, indeed. This is not a very
cheerful place for you, and I am not a very cheer-
ful companion. And who is your friend, Ned?</said></p>
<p><said>He's the best man in the world, I believe,</said>
exclaimed Ned enthusiastically. <said>His name's
Jack Grigsby.</said></p>
<p><said>Grigsby! Why, that is the name of the old
man who called upon me.</said></p>
<p><said>Called upon you, aunt!</said></p>
<p><said>Aye; he came to inquire about you.</said></p>
<p><said>About me!</said> returned Ned, more mystified
than ever. <said>But I was living with him. Ah!
perhaps it was after I—(he was going to say <q>was
stolen,</q> but he altered his mind)—came to the
<q>Jolly Waterman.</q> I suppose he wanted to know
where I was?</said></p>
<pb n="206"/>
<fw><q>Have I a Father?</q></fw>
<p><said>He did, and yet he didn't. If I'd only been
as wise as I am now I should have saved you
much trouble, my boy. But how could I tell that
the lad he was in search of was the lad whom
he had befriended?</said></p>
<p>Again Ned looked puzzled. His aunt was
speaking in that musing tone which people assume
when their thoughts are far away. The woman
was looking back to the time when she and her
brother—the wild lad who used to get into all
kinds of scrapes, and who finally ran away to sea
—were boy and girl together. Perhaps she recog-
nized in the lad before her much that reminded
her of his father. She drew the wondering boy
to her side and fondled with his hair.</p>
<p><said>My dear,</said> said she, <said>it was an evil day for
you when your father went away and left you in
my charge.</said></p>
<p><said>My father!</said> said Ned, his heart beating with
a new-found joy. <said>Have I a father?</said></p>
<p><said>No, indeed, my boy. He is dead; and it was
to tell me of his death that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, your
friend, came down to Lincoln.</said></p>
<p><said>Then <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby knew my father?</said> returned
the lad quickly. <said>I am glad of that.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes; he was an old shipmate of his. Your
father was a sailor, my dear; and a braver fellow
never commanded a ship than Captain Sam Somer-
set. I should like to see the person who'd con-
tradict me.</said></p>
<pb n="207"/>
<fw>Explanations.</fw>
<p>The woman was quite excited. Her eyes shone
brightly and the colour came into her face, and
she looked almost handsome. Indeed, when she
was young she had been very good looking, though
few would have recognized in her faded features
the Rhoda Somerset about whom half the farmers'
sons in the neighbourhood went mad and quar-
relled and fought.</p>
<p><said>Yes, my dear,</said> she went on, her excitement
fading away, <said>your father died just when he
neared England, and hoped never to go to sea
again. I had long since given him up for lost,
for since he went away and left you with me I
had not heard from him.</said></p>
<p><said>But,</said> objected Ned, <said>if he left me with you,
aunt, how is it I do not remember you?</said></p>
<p><said>Because you were very young, and my son
Robert, and your cousin, wanted to take care of
me.</said></p>
<p><said>To take care of me!</said> cried the boy, flushing,
for he never heard his cousin's name mentioned
without feeling angry. <said>Why, he did nothing
but ill use me, and then turned me out into the
streets when I was only a little chap. You know
that, Ann, don't you?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, dear,</said> replied Ann with a sigh; <said>but
you need not have stopped away.</said></p>
<p><said>Needn't I? Didn't I know, although I was
so young—I suppose I wasn't more'n five, was I?
—that if I once went back he'd half kill me, and
<pb n="208"/>
<fw>The Cause of Bob Locket's Hatred.</fw>
perhaps you as well? No, I didn't want to come
back.</said></p>
<p>The elder woman heard this with a stony, set
look, which seemed to say that she was prepared
to hear anything that was bad concerning her
son Bob. It was news to her that he had ill used
the boy, whom, as she told <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, she be-
lieved to be dead. It was only when Ann came
to Lincoln that she discovered the truth, namely,
that Ned was not drowned, but had disappeared;
for even Ann had not the heart to say that it was
her husband who had turned the boy out of doors.</p>
<p><said>Well, Ned,</said> said his aunt, <said>we'll say no more
about this. The best thing you can do is to get
back to London. Your friend, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, will
be of more use to you than I can be. Do not let
Bob know you are here. He is not to be trusted,
take my word for it, though I am his mother—
worse luck.</said></p>
<p>Ned was silent for a moment, and then said
<said>Why is it Bob hates me so?</said></p>
<p><said>I can't tell you,</said> replied the elder woman
shortly.</p>
<p><said><emph>I</emph> can,</said> said Ann suddenly. <said>He was all
right while your father sent money for your keep,
but directly that was left off he turned against you.
And now—well, it is the little bit of money your
father has left you that he wants. Cannot you
see, mother,</said> she continued, turning to Ned's aunt,
<said>that if Ned were not in the way his father's
<pb n="209"/>
<fw>Ned Says Good-bye to His Aunt.</fw>
money would come to you? and then—well, you
know what you've done before—given every far-
thing you had to him, and so you will again. Ned,
my boy, your aunt is right. Get to London as
soon as you can, and go to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby and tell
him everything. If he wants any evidence that
you are the son of Captain Somerset let him come
to me and to your aunt. Mother,</said> she added,
turning round quickly to the other woman, <said>there
was a sovereign in that old vase on the mantel-
shelf this morning. That will be more than suffi-
cient to take Ned to London. Can he not have
it?</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, let him take it, Ann,</said> said the elder
woman, rocking herself to and fro.</p>
<p>And so Ann went to the mantel-shelf, took up
the vase, and put the sovereign it contained into
the boy's hand.</p>
<p><said>You had better go now, my dear,</said> she whis-
pered.</p>
<p>She kissed the lad, who put his arms round her
neck and returned her embrace.</p>
<p><said>Good-bye, aunt!</said> said he going up to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Locket.</p>
<p><said>Good-bye, Ned!</said> she answered, in a kinder
tone than she had hitherto used. But she did
not kiss him as Ann had done. He paused for a
moment, and then seeing she had no more to say,
turned and went out.</p>

<p>When he got outside the house he found
it was a lovely moonlight night. The
houses on either side stood out with
sharp outlines against the pale sky, and the tower
of the cathedral looked almost fairylike in the
distance.</p>
<p>But it cannot be said that either the houses or
the cathedral occupied a place in Ned's mind.
What with the deceitful behaviour of Sam Hog-
gins and his wife, and hints which Ann and his
aunt had let fall as to the reason of Bob's hatred,
he had plenty to think about. Yet, though the
latter was the most important, the thing that
aggravated him most was the discovery that Meg
and Sam had deceived him.</p>
<p><said>It is too bad,</said> he exclaimed indignantly, <said>I
should have been half-way to London had it not
been for them. I won't stay another day with
them after to-morrow, and they can't make me.</said></p>
<p>He was in no hurry to go home, in fact he did
<pb n="211"/>
<fw>A Strange Recognition.</fw>
not much care whether he went back to the cara-
van or not. Without noticing where he was
going, he had gradually left the city behind him,
and had got into the country. It was very flat
on either side, and the road to the north lay before
him as straight as though it had been ruled by a
ruler. The straightness of this road is accounted
for by the fact that it was originally made by the
Romans, who were the finest roadmakers in the
world. This great north road, in days long gone
by, was called Ermine Street, and ran from Lon-
don though Enfield, Ware, Huntingdon, Lincoln,
right away to the River Humber.</p>
<p>But Ned knew nothing of this, and perhaps
would not have noticed the straightness of the
road had it not been that this quality enabled him
to see two persons who were walking towards him
much sooner than he would have done had the
road, like most roads, turned and twisted.</p>
<p>Ned was blessed with remarkably sharp sight,
and though these two persons were nearly a
quarter of a mile away, there was something he
could see in their appearance even at that dis-
tance which excited his curiosity. One of the
two persons was a man much taller than the
other, which perhaps was nothing very extraordi-
nary; but what <emph>was</emph> extraordinary was that he
could not tell whether the <emph>other</emph> was a man or a
woman. Half a dozen times he decided that the
person must be a woman from the flowing gar-
<pb n="212"/>
<fw>Tracking the Thieves.</fw>
ments which blew about as he walked, and as
often he altered his mind, and said to himself that
no woman would walk as this individual did, swing-
ing the arms and legs like the sails of a windmill.</p>
<p>By and bye as the two got nearer he found that
the last conjecture was the true one. The un-
certain individual with the loose dress and the
swinging arms was a man, and what was more, a
Chinaman!</p>
<p>Ned knew him at once, and he knew also his
companion.</p>
<p><said>If it isn't that Yankee chap that tried to steal
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's bag! A pair of thieves he and that
Chinaman, I'll swear!</said> exclaimed the lad.</p>
<p>But what could they be doing in Lincolnshire,
was the mystery which Ned could not solve. Of
all the strange things he had found out that day
this was the strangest. How vividly the singular
look of the Chinaman recalled that eventful night
when he so cleverly outwitted the celestial and
checkmated the American!</p>
<p><said>I followed them before to some end. I've a
good mind to follow 'em again,</said> he muttered.
<said>They mean no good to some one, <emph>I</emph> know.</said></p>
<p>While watching the two men approach he had
sat down on the bank in a small opening in the
hedge which bordered the road, and quick as
thought he slid backward through the gap, and
was out of sight in half a minute.</p>
<p>Presently the men went by without turning
<pb n="213"/>
<fw>The American Shooting-Gallery.</fw>
their heads towards the opening where he had
disappeared, and he made sure they had not seen
him. Waiting until they had got some distance
away, he stole out cautiously, and keeping close
to the hedge kept them in sight until they entered
the city, when he ran forward fearing they might
escape him in the streets.</p>
<p>But there was little chance of his missing them.
It was nearly ten o'clock, and the good people of
Lincoln were nearly all indoors eating their sup-
pers, so that the streets were quite clear. The
men made their way straight to the fair field, and
thither Ned went also, but not without some tre-
pidation lest he should meet Bob Locket.</p>
<p>This fear made him doubly careful, and instead
of walking directly behind the two he dodged
them from the back of the caravans and stalls,
and finally saw them safely landed at a booth,
which oddly enough was immediately at the back
of the canvas which Sam had stuck up to pre-
vent the cocoa-nut sticks from flying too far.</p>
<p>Ned watched them disappear, and then cau-
tiously wound his way in and out the line of
caravans so as to bring him in front of the booth.
When he saw the flaring announcements outside
he could scarcely believe his eyes, for on one side
was a gaily painted canvas proclaiming that the
interior was the great American shooting-gallery,
while on the other an equally gay placard asserted
that <emph>the</emph> attraction of the fair was the conjuring
<pb n="214"/>
<fw>Late Home to Supper.</fw>
performance of the world-renowned Chinese jug-
gler, Ah Ling Foo!</p>
<p>But as if to make assurance doubly sure, while,
half hidden by the framework of a roundabout,
Ned was gazing at the booth, the curtain forming
the door was moved aside, and a man put his
head out The boy had no doubt now that he
had come upon the three partners, for the face of
the man which the moonlight revealed was the
face of his cousin Bob Locket!</p>
<p>The combination of these three men struck him
with peculiar significance. How was it they had
come together? It was more than strange, and
he could not help thinking they had other business
besides shooting and jugglery.</p>
<p><said>I should like to stay and find out what it is,
but I'm afraid. There's only one more day for
the fair, it's true, but we're so close together Bob
might see me, and I wouldn't like to fall into <emph>his</emph>
hands again,</said> he muttered.</p>
<p>He had found his way back by this time to
Sam's caravan. He had not eaten anything since
dinner, and was very hungry. He found that
Sam and his wife had already had supper, and Sam
himself, after having indulged in a pipe, had gone
fast asleep on the floor.</p>
<p><said>I thought you'd given us the slip,</said> said Meg
in no very gracious tone.</p>
<p><said>Not yet, ma'am. I should like to have some
supper first.</said></p>
<pb n="215"/>
<fw>A Voice Through a Canvas Wall.</fw>
<p><said>You ought to think yourself fortunate there's
supper for you. There, look sharp and eat it. I
can't stand waiting about all day for boys.</said></p>
<p>Meg, it was clear, was in a bad temper; and as
Ned did not care to engage in a quarrel he said
nothing, but sat down to some bread and cheese,
which he despatched in a remarkably quick time.</p>
<p><said>You'd better clear out,</said> said Meg when he had
finished. <said>I want to tidy up the place a bit afore
I go to bed, and don't want you bothering me.</said></p>
<p>Ned accordingly took his cap and went out.
He was half inclined to go there and then and
never return, but he could not make up his mind.
It would be better on the whole, he thought, to
wait and keep to his agreement.</p>
<p><said>Hi! you, Ned,</said> shouted Meg, suddenly appearing
at the door of the caravan. <said>Just fix up the canvas
there. It'll be torn to ribbons. Here's some string.</said></p>
<p>And she pointed to a place where the wind,
which had been very high all that day, had torn
the canvas from the pole.</p>
<p><said aloud="false">I suppose I'd better do it,</said> he thought.</p>
<p>He picked up the ball of string which Meg had
thrown to him, walked towards the canvas, and set
about repairing it.</p>
<p>He had not been more than two minutes at his
work when he heard the shrill voice of the China-
man exclaim:</p>
<p><said><emph>Chin chin, chop chop</emph>. Muchey richy after.</said></p>
<p><said>Ah Ling's right,</said> replied some one with a
<pb n="216"/>
<fw>A Spy-hole.</fw>
nasal twang. It was not his cousin's voice, so it
must be the American who spoke, thought Ned.</p>
<p><said>Supper first and then to divide the swag, eh,
Bob?</said></p>
<p><said>Right you are, though I shouldn't ha' thought
as chin chin, chop chop, meant all that.</said></p>
<p><said><emph>Chin chin</emph> is food, <emph>chop chop</emph> is quick, right
away, smart,</said> Ned heard the American explain.</p>
<p>And soon by the clattering of a plate, and the
guggling sound of some liquid being poured from
a bottle, Ned guessed the men were at supper.</p>
<p>Now, as we have already said, the conjuring
and shooting booth was close to the canvas which
Ned was mending. Indeed so close was it that
scarcely a foot of ground was between the two.
The word <q>swag</q> mentioned by the American
told Ned much more than it would another boy,
because he knew well enough that it generally
meant the proceeds of some robbery. Seeing that
the booth was so close, it occurred to him that he
might reach it easily without moving from his
own side of the canvas, make a hole in a portion
of the slight woodwork of which the booth was
composed, and by just putting his head through
the hole torn by the wind, see into the interior.</p>
<p>He was more fortunate than he expected to be.
The back of the booth was made of very thin
planks of wood called matchboard lining, scarcely
more than an eighth of an inch thick. These had
been loosely nailed on uprights, and the whole
<pb n="217"/>
<fw>Strange Preparations.</fw>
roughly papered. Owing to the contraction of
the paper in drying there was a crack half an inch
at the widest part extending quite a couple of feet,
and through this he could see easily enough.</p>
<p>There they were, the Chinaman, the American,
and his cousin, seated round a small coke fire, and
eating their dinners with much appetite, particu-
larly the Chinaman, who was devouring a big
plate of boiled rice with extraordinary rapidity,
his chop-sticks travelling between the food and
his mouth at express speed. They were, indeed,
so busily engaged in eating that they talked but
little, yet every word they uttered was heard dis-
tinctly by Ned. Above them swung a flaring
naphtha lamp, and by its light the boy could easily
see their features.</p>
<p>When they had finished, Ah Ling, who seemed
to act as the servant, cleared away the plates,
leaving, however, the mugs, for the big stone
bottle had still plenty of beer in it, and Ned's
attention grew keener than ever, for some odd
preparations were being made.</p>
<p>From a basket Bob Locket produced a couple
of files and half a dozen of steel wedges, sharpened
to a fine point and of various sizes, and brought
from a corner a huge sledge-hammer. These he
placed on the ground. Then he and the American
went to a dark corner of the booth and brought
between them a sack, which apparently contained
something that was very heavy.</p>
<pb n="218"/>
<fw>The Cannon-Ball Once More.</fw>
<p>This was deposited by the side of the files and
wedges. Bob and Hosea Lampard took hold of the
bottom of the sack, lifted it up, gave it a vigorous
shake, and out rolled a black shining round can-
non-ball!</p>
<p>Ned was transfixed with astonishment. The
cannon-ball that Jack Grigsby had nearly been
robbed of once by the identical Chinaman and
American who were now before him, the cannon-
ball that he had seen every day of his life at
Gibraltar Cottage, to be here in a booth in a
country fair! It was incredible.</p>
<p>Of course there was more than one cannon-ball
in the world, and had the men been perfect
strangers to him Ned would not have thought
so much of the matter, though the coincidence
would have been strange. But to see a cannon-
ball, as nearly as possible like the one he had left
behind in the pilot's house, in the possession of
the very two men who wanted to get hold of it,
was something so remarkable, he could not but
think the cannon-ball before him had been stolen
from Gibraltar Cottage.</p>
<p>But he had little time to think over all this, for
what was going on before his eyes was so singular
it drove everything else out of his head.</p>
<p>The ball had been fixed tightly in a kind of
vice by Bob Locket and Hosea Lampard, and then
the former, taking up one of the files, began to
work away as if he wanted to cut it in half. After
<pb n="219"/>
<fw>Labour in Vain. Who's the Cheat?</fw>
filing for about two minutes or so, Lampard and
Ah Ling anxiously watching meanwhile, Locket
left off and looked carefully at the small line he
had made in the metal. A singular change came
over his face, and Ned could see his hands tremble
with excitement.</p>
<p><said>You're a pair of cheats!</said> he burst out all at
once, and dashed the file to the ground.</p>
<p><said>Cheats!</said> echoed Lampard. <said>What d'ye mean,
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bob Locket? If anybody is a cheat it's your-
self, I reckon.</said></p>
<p><said>Look at it for yourselves. Look at it, I say.
It's <emph>iron!</emph></said> shouted Locket.</p>
<p>His companions bent down instantly and al-
most put their noses against the cannon-ball, so
closely did they peer into it.</p>
<p>The next word Ned heard was an oath from
the American, who, springing to his feet, clutched
Locket by the throat and shook him as though he
had been a kitten.</p>
<p><said>You thief!</said> he hissed. <said>You've changed it—
you know you have.</said></p>
<p><said>Let go!</said> gurgled Bob Locket, half black in the
face. <said>Let go!</said></p>
<p>Hosea Lampard relaxed his grasp a little, and
Bob, giving his head a wrench, shook himself free.</p>
<p><said>You're a nice 'un, you are, to pretty near kill a
fellow. The thing's never been out of your sight. If
anybody's played us false, it's your Chinese friend
there. I told you I never thought much of him.</said></p>
<pb n="220"/>
<fw>Was It All a Lie?</fw>
<p>Upon this, Lampard, who was in a furious pas-
sion, turned upon Ah Ling, who immediately fell
upon his knees, and in the most abject fashion
protested that he had acted honestly throughout.
Then all three began to talking excitedly together,
and so great was the confusion Ned could not dis-
tinguish one voice from another.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a lull. The American loosed
the vice, seized the cannon-ball, turned it round,
and began filing at the opposite side till the per-
spiration poured off his face. Then once more all
three examined the marks which had been filed,
only to burst out into a fresh torrent of reproaches
mingled with oaths and lamentations.</p>
<p>Now the only part of this scene which was at
all intelligible to Ned was that the three men ex-
pected to find the cannon-ball quite different from
what it was. Still clearer was it to him that the
ball had been stolen from Jack Grigsby, and that
if Jack Grigsby valued it, no matter how worth-
less it was, he would do his best to restore it.</p>
<p>If he had been in any doubt about the matter the
conversation which ensued would have settled it.</p>
<p><said>Wasn't it all a lie, now, that you told me about
this cannon-ball?</said> said Locket after his rage had
subsided, and after he had been staring in the fire
for two or three minutes in a state of stupefaction.</p>
<p><said>Lie,</said> retorted Lampard. <said>No. I tell you Ah
Ling saw it in the captain's cabin, and so did I.
Excepting the sailor who told you by accident,
<pb n="221"/>
<fw>Ready to Try Again.</fw>
and it was only hearsay on his part, none of the
crew knew what we did. And I'll swear that old
fellow Jack Grigsby took it home.</said></p>
<p><said>Then what's the meaning of <emph>that</emph> useless thing?</said>
demanded Locket pointing to the despised cannon-
ball.</p>
<p><said>How should <emph>I</emph> know? You were one of the
party that took it—</said></p>
<p><said>Say, stole it. What's the use of mincing the
matter?</said> put in Locket sullenly.</p>
<p><said>Well, <q>stole</q> it, if you like; <emph>I</emph> don't care. You
were one, I repeat, and you know as much about
it as we do, I calc'late.</said></p>
<p><said>All I've got to say is that it's a beastly shame,</said>
groaned Locket.</p>
<p>And this seemed to be the opinion of the three, for
they sat there in the most dejected attitude possible.</p>
<p><said>I tell you what, Robert Locket,</said> said at last
the American. <said>I guess we'd better dissolve part-
nership. This shooting game's too slow for me. You
Britishers don't spend enough money. They've got
no spirit, they haven't.</said></p>
<p><said>What! and leave you alone to have another
try for the cannon-ball? You're very artful, cap'en,
but you're not artful enough to do me. Now I'll
just ask you a plain question. Do you believe
there's another cannon-ball, and that we've got
the wrong one? That's the point.</said></p>
<p><said>Of course I do,</said> returned Hosea Lampard after
thinking a little while.</p>
<pb n="222"/>
<fw>Ned Waits to Run Away.</fw>
<p><said>Well, then, why shouldn't we have another try?
The old man's house is easy enough to break into?</said></p>
<p><said>Oh, if that's your game I'm with you.</said></p>
<p>And then their voices gradually died away into
a whisper.</p>
<p>Ned could hear no more, and so he crept away,
his head confused and in a whirl. What was he to
do? he asked himself. To go to the police station,
was his first thought; but how could he get away
at that time of night without exciting suspicion?</p>
<p><said>I won't say anything to Sam about it. He's
deceived me once, but he sha'n't do it a second
time,</said> he muttered. <said>I'll get up as soon as it's
daylight to-morrow morning and go to the police.</said></p>
<p>And his mind made up on this point he went
back to the caravan, Meg receiving him with a
scowl, for he was now entirely out of her favour.</p>
<p><said>You'd better get to bed. Hanging about so late
at night, I've no patience with you.</said></p>
<p>Ned did not think it worth while to answer,
but went quickly to the corner where his bed was,
and threw himself down.</p>
<p>But not to sleep.</p>
<p>Hour after hour he heard chime from the cathe-
dral clock, and then when it was broad daylight
he got up softly, dressed himself, and went out
without making the least noise.</p>

<head type="main">Jack Grigsby's Clever Trick</head>

<p>Jack Grigsby was having a pipe after
supper, as was his custom Sunday or week-
days. To-night was Monday night; some
friends had called in during the evening, and the
consequence was that the whole household was
up later than usual.</p>
<p><said>Nine o'clock and you not in bed, Nellie!</said> said
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby. <said>I don't know where your roses
will be to-morrow.</said></p>
<p><said>Only five minutes more,</said> pleaded Nellie, <said>and
then you'll see how quick I can be.</said></p>
<p><said>Very well; but, mind, you must keep your
word.</said></p>
<p>Which Nellie having promised to do buried her
head in the picture-book she was looking at, and
began to make the most of the time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, laying down his pipe,
rose from his chair, and began walking about the
room, an exercise he had that evening several
times indulged in.</p>
<pb n="224"/>
<fw>Jack Grigsby's <soCalled>Presenteriment.</soCalled></fw>
<p><said>My dear John,</said> said his wife, <said>how restless
you are to-night!</said></p>
<p><said>It's a rum thing, Jennie,</said> remarked the pilot
reflectively, <said>that I feel just as I did afore the
<name rend="i" type="vessel">Sea Foam</name> struck the <name rend="i" type="vessel">John Fletcher</name>. I had a sort
of presenteriment all that day as something was
going to happen, and so it did, as you remember,
don't you?</said></p>
<p>Yes, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby well remembered the day,
twenty years since, when the intelligence was
brought her that her husband's ship was run into
during a fog and sank, her captain and crew sav-
ing nothing but their lives.</p>
<p><said>I can't get that boy out of my head,</said> said he.</p>
<p>And the pilot looked at the sideboard where the
cannon-ball used to stand, and sighed.</p>
<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby seemed almost to know in what
direction her husband's eyes were turned, for she
made a significant gesture with her hand towards
Nellie, as if to warn him not to say anything
about the cannon-ball, lest it should revive un-
pleasant recollections of the thieves.</p>
<p>Jack Grigsby understood her, and nodding his
head slightly said he would have one more pipe
and then go to bed.</p>
<p><said>The five minutes must be up, Nell, I think,</said>
said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby.</p>
<p><said>It wants another half minute, grannie,</said> re-
plied the young lady, who had divided her atten-
tion between her book and the clock on the mantel-
<pb n="225"/>
<fw>A Startling Appearance.</fw>
shelf, and had no notion of being defrauded of her
rights.</p>
<p>The second-hand of the timepiece had not made
thirty steps forward when a loud double knock
was heard at the street door.</p>
<p><said>What did I say, my dear?</said> asked the pilot.
<said>Wasn't I right when I said something was going
to happen. We've no friends as would call upon
us this time o' Sunday night. I'll go myself and
open the door.</said> And away the old man trudged.</p>
<p>As no one was expected so late, the door had
been locked, bolted, and chained, and it took some
little time to undo all the fastenings. When the
door was opened Jack saw standing before him a
tall man in a long <choice><reg>great-coat</reg><orig>greatcoat</orig></choice> of blue cloth, but-
toned up to the chin in military fashion.</p>
<p><said><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby?</said> said the tall man.</p>
<p><said>That's my name, skipper,</said> responded Jack.</p>
<p>Upon which the visitor turned round to some
one who was standing behind him.</p>
<p><said>Perhaps you know—</said> he began.</p>
<p>But he didn't finish the sentence, for Jack,
catching sight of the man's companion, exclaimed
in a voice loud enough to be heard half-way down
the street: <said>Bless my stars if it isn't young Ned!</said></p>
<p>And dashing at the boy he dragged him into
the passage to look at him under the lamp, and
make sure he had not deceived himself.</p>
<p>But when he saw Ned's face beaming all over
with smiles he knew he had not made a mistake,
<pb n="226"/>
<fw>The Inspector Says His Say.</fw>
and such a pulling and hauling into the parlour
was never seen, for Nellie, hearing her grand-
father's exclamation, had run out and assisted in
the triumphant entry. For the next five minutes
everybody was talking together, and in the excess
of joy not one of the party could speak fast enough.</p>
<p>In the meantime the tall man had stepped into
the passage, carefully closing the door behind him.
He waited until something like order was restored,
and then said quietly: <said><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby, I've come all
the way from Lincoln this afternoon to speak
with you on very important business. I am In-
spector Brown of the Lincolnshire constabulary.</said></p>
<p>A policeman! <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby's face fell. Had
Ned got into trouble? was his first thought.</p>
<p><said>Well, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Inspector,</said> he replied, <said>I'm a man
of few words, and I like everything plain and
straightfor'rard. Whatever you've got to say,
out with it.</said></p>
<p><said>I learn, on the information of the boy here,
that there's been a robbery on your premises.</said></p>
<p><said>Yes, you're right, so far.</said></p>
<p><said>What was the article stolen?</said></p>
<p><said>Why, a cannon-ball.</said></p>
<p>Upon which Ned shot a glance of triumph at
the inspector. The latter expected he had been
brought to London on a fool's errand, and his face
showed he was agreeably disappointed.</p>
<p><said>You don't seem to be much upset by the loss,</said>
he replied.</p>
<pb n="227"/>
<fw>Jack Grigsby's Triumph.</fw>
<p><said>Of course I ain't, because the rascals didn't
get the cannon-ball they expected. Look here,
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Inspector, if ever there's been an artful plot,
it's been this plot to get hold of this cannon-ball.
But whoever the scoundrels were I've been even
with 'em. Ha, ha! The cannon-ball as they
took away was only iron, the cannon-ball as they
thought they'd got, and which was safe at the
bank all the time, was of <emph>solid gold!</emph></said></p>
<p>Gold—a cannon ball of gold! Never was heard
such a curious thing. No wonder the inspector
was staggered and Ned and Nellie stared open
mouth. Jack Grigsby and his wife were the only
persons who were at all unmoved.</p>
<p><said>But I tell you this, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Inspector,</said> continued
Jack Grigsby emphatically, <said>that though this
cannon-ball as these fellows have stolen isn't
worth more than twopence, I'm going to punish the
thieves just as if it was worth a thousand pounds.
Now, then, what's the names of the gang?</said></p>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Inspector referred to his note-book.</p>
<p><said>Number one is a Chinaman, named Ah Ling
Foo; number two an American, Hosea Lampard;
number three an Englishman, Robert Locket.</said></p>
<p><said>I knew it. I was certain of it,</said> cried <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Grigsby, snapping his fingers with delight. <said>And
do you say you've got 'em in custody?</said></p>
<p><said>They're safe in Lincoln jail, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, if this isn't the best thing as ever I
heard. Jennie, my dear, mix some grog—Nellie,

you puss, help your grandmother to get the
glasses—sit down, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Inspector, sit down, sir,
there's a long yarn to spin, <emph>I</emph> can see—Ned, you
young rascal—bless me, how tall and strong the
fellow looks!</said> and away went <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby bust-
ling into the kitchen, to return with a kettle of
water, which he stuck on the fire, talking all the
while, and looking the picture of happiness.</p>
<p>In spite of the lateness of the hour he would
make Ned spin his <soCalled>yarn,</soCalled> which Ned did in a
much shorter time than it has taken me to tell it.</p>
<p>The only thing he had to add to what we al-
ready know, was how he ran to the police station
and told Inspector Brown what he had seen inside
the booth. Perhaps the policeman would not
have taken so much trouble as he had if it had
not been that Locket had kidnapped the boy.
This in his eyes was a much more serious offence
than the stealing of a valueless iron ball. So put-
ting everything together he resolved to take the
three men into custody at once, and coming to
London to inquire into the truth of Ned's story.</p>
<p><said>Well, now, that's a wonderful story, Ned, my
lad; but I've got one that'll beat it, haven't I,
Jennie? Ah! and it's through my wife, <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Inspector, that we haven't got to charge these
fellows with stealing gold instead of iron. This
is how it all happened. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grigsby was a dust-
ing that ball one day when she feels a something
sticking up like a ring. She thinks to herself,
<pb n="229"/>
<fw>How It Was Found Out.</fw>
<said aloud="false">That's rum. I've never felt nothing like that afore.</said>
Well, sir, when I comes home she shows it me,
and <emph>I</emph> feels it, and I says to her that looks un-
commonly like a plug, I says. Well, I just puts
in a gimlet, and sure enough it <emph>was</emph> a plug made
of wood, fitting as near as maybe, and painted
over like the rest of the ball. By looking at it
you couldn't have told it was there, and it was
only through my wife's clever fingers that we
found it out.</said> And the look of admiration which
Jack Grigsby gave his wife just here would have
done anybody's heart good.</p>
<p><said>Well, sir, you may be sure it wasn't long afore
I had the plug out, and then if I didn't open my
eyes at what I found. Here it is all written on
this piece of paper, which I've carried in my
pocket-book ever since. I wouldn't trust it to
nobody else's keeping. Not I.</said></p>
<p>Taking an old brown leather pocket-book from
his breast pocket, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby produced from an
envelope a scrap of paper, which he read out as
follows:—</p>
<q>
<p>San Francisco, August 3rd.</p>
<p>This day John Harbledon &amp; Co., goldsmiths of
this city, have delivered to me the golden cannon-
ball which I instructed them to make out of the
nuggets I got at White Stone Camp. My reason
for having the nuggets hammered into this shape
is this: I recognize among the crew two men
who know I have been lucky at the diggings. I

<fw>What It Really Was.</fw>
know Ah Ling Foo and Hosea Lampard to be
unscrupulous fellows, and I adopt this mode of
deceiving them.</p>
<p>Samuel Somerset,
(Master) Ship <name rend="i" type="vessel">Good Fortune</name>.</p>
</q>
<p><said>And we found, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Inspector, as what Captain
Somerset said was gospel truth. That cannon-
ball, weighing somewhere about twenty pounds
or so, was solid gold painted black. No sooner
did we find it out than we knowed why those
three rascals wanted it. But I was even with 'em.
I wouldn't have the gold in the place at all. I
rushed off with it to the bank, and the next day
I was down at Woolwich and got a friend to give
me a cannon-ball as near as possible the same size.
And it was <emph>that</emph> one as the thieves took.</said></p>
<p>The recollection of his own cleverness was too
much for Jack Grigsby, and he had to stop to
chuckle for at least a minute and a half.</p>
<p><said>I should like to have seen their faces when
they thought they was going to break up the
gold and divide it. Ha, ha! ho, ho! Didn't they
look foolish, Ned?</said></p>
<p><said>They were all in a great passion, I know that,</said>
said Ned. <said>Each one, I expect, thought the other
had got the real cannon-ball.</said></p>
<p><said>Well, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grigsby,</said> said the inspector, <said>I
must compliment you on your sharpness. But
where is Captain Somerset?</said></p>
<p><said>Captain Somerset, my old shipmate, is dead,</said>
replied the old pilot in reverent tones.</p>
<pb n="231"/>
<fw>Who He Turned Out To Be.</fw>
<p>The reply was so unexpected the inspector
started.</p>
<p>Jack Grigsby was silent for a few seconds, and
then rousing himself said in his usual voice, <said>Now
you, Nell, be off to bed. Ned, you're tired out, I
can see. You'd better go too.</said></p>
<p>Ned protested that he was not a bit tired, but
his eyes told a different tale, and he at last con-
fessed that he would like to sleep.</p>
<p><said>I didn't tell you before the boy,</said> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Grigsby to the inspector, <said>but it's my belief as
he's Captain Somerset's son. This fellow Locket
was the captain's nephew, and took care of the
boy. Now what I want to find out is whether
that boy and Ned are the same.</said></p>
<p><said>My dear John, surely you haven't been listen-
ing to the boy's story?</said> suddenly put in <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Grigsby in her quiet manner. <said>Hasn't he re-
peatedly mentioned his cousin Bob Locket and
his wife Ann. Why, you've actually forgotten
all about his going to his aunt—Bob's mother—
and her giving him a sovereign. There's no more
doubt about it. Our Ned <emph>is</emph> Ned Somerset.</said></p>
<p>Jack Grigsby took a long breath, and then gave
his leg a vigorous slap.</p>
<p><said>Right again, old lady. Blest if you don't find
out everything. What a lubber I must ha' been
not to have seen it all along.</said></p>
<p>Jack Grigsby persisted in prosecuting the three
plotters, and right well did they deserve their
<pb n="232"/>
<fw>The True Legacy.</fw>
punishment. Only once did Bob Locket appear
on the scene again, and that was when he came
out of prison, and went to Jack Grigsby begging
him to help him to get to Australia. Ned,
who had long ceased to think about reveng-
ing himself on his cousin for his cruelty, inter-
ceded in his behalf, and at last Jack consented
and lent him the passage-money. As for Ann,
she lived but a very short time after the convic-
tion of her husband, and the sister of Captain
Somerset survived her many years.</p>
<p>And what about the golden cannon-ball? Well,
it, or to speak more correctly, its equivalent value
in crisp bank-notes came into Ned's possession
when he was twenty-one, which important event
happened not so very long ago. He has be-
come a sailor like his father, greatly to the
delight of Jack Grigsby, now a grizzled old salt,
and I am told that when he obtains a captain's
certificate there is to be a wedding, in which
Nellie, prettier if possible as a woman than as a
girl, will be the bride.</p>
