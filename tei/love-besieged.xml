<p>More than half-a-century has passed since the Mutiny of
1857 shook the structure of our supremacy in India to
its very foundations. The causes of the disaffection, the
identity of the actual leaders, the methods of organisation,
are as mysterious now as they were then. Time has done
little to add to our knowledge of the native of India. He
moves slowly and silently, he goes about his avocation
apparently contented, he pays his taxes, and probably
grumbles less than the average Englishman. So long as
all is quiet, his rulers do not trouble; they are satisfied
everything is well if nothing is seen. But the Eastern
nature never changes. It is as it has ever been, subtle,
secret, patient. No one at the time of the Mutiny was able
to penetrate below the surface. The episode of the greased
cartridges was but the spark which ignited the fuse. The
fuse itself was invisible, the hands that laid it unknown.</p>

<p><q>Unrest in India</q>—the words might almost be stereo-
typed. From time to time a mist of doubt has arisen, has
floated across the horizon, has melted away. Until two
years ago, no serious importance was attached to simmer-
<pb n="6"/>
ings of discontent. The events of the past two years, how-
ever, show that this <q>unrest</q> has entered upon a new
phase. Western education and training, grafted upon
Eastern traditions, custom, character, religion, have intro-
duced fresh dangers, the result of which no man can
foresee.</p>

<p>We in England must never forget the fixed, immutable
characteristics of the Indian race. It is well, therefore,
that the memory of the past should not be allowed to die
out. This end I have had in view in selecting the Siege of
Lucknow as the background of a story in which an attempt
has been made to picture the circumstances and conditions
of the time, the character and methods of the mutineers,
the influence of caste, the treachery of which the native is
capable and the loyalty which upon occasion he can show,
and the heroism, the fortitude, the unflinching devotion of
the defenders. For colour I have gone to the pages of
Mr Commissioner Gubbins, Major Wilson, Colonel Inglis,
whose graphic accounts glow with actuality. Colonel S. B.
Malleson has, in his <q>History of the Indian Mutiny,</q>
brought together most of the salient facts in connection
with the siege, and Mr Archibald Forbes' account of the
entry of the relief force under Havelock can scarcely be
bettered. To the authors of <q>Defence of Lucknow, by a
Staff Officer,</q> and <q>A Lady's Diary of the Siege</q> I am also
under an obligation.</p>

<p>A few words need to be said of Azimoolah Khan, the
mysterious figure of whom I have ventured to give an im-
<pb n="7"/>
perfect outline. The only historian of the Indian Mutiny
who, so far as I know, has dealt with Azimoolah Khan is
Lieutenant Mowbray Thomson, one of the survivors of the
Cawnpore Massacre. Lieutenant Thomson writes, <q>Subtle,
intriguing, politic, unscrupulous and bloodthirsty, the man
betrayed no animosity to us until the outburst of the
Mutiny, and then he became the presiding genius in the
assault of Cawnpore.</q> Lieutenant Thomson attributes to
Azimoolah Khan the instigation of the rebellion. Nana
Sahib, he asserts, was but a puppet in the crafty villain's
hands, <q>for this Azimoolah was the actual murderer of our
sisters and their babes.</q> Lieutenant Thomson adds that
when Havelock's men entered the Nana's palace at Bithoor
they found piles of letters from leading society ladies in
London—unmistakable proofs of Azimoolah's fascination,
and of his amazing duplicity. The words I have placed in
the mouth of the club gossip's description of Azimoolah,
his origin, and the object of his mission to England, are
based on Lieutenant Thomson's statement. The end of
Azimoolah Khan, like that of his infamous confederate
Nana Sahib, is buried in darkness. Taking advantage of
the licence of romance, I have endeavoured to supply a
solution of the mystery.</p>

<head type="main">Azimoolah Khan</head>

<p>One fine morning in the early spring of 1857, an
open carriage, drawn by a couple of superb horses,
was proceeding at a slow pace along the Mall, towards
St James's Palace. In it were seated two ladies and
a man, unmistakably an Oriental, even had he not
been wearing the characteristic Hindoo headdress.</p>

<p>The man's dark velvety eyes were fixed admiringly
on the fresh fair face of the younger of the two ladies
—a graceful girl with large tender eyes, and masses
of dark brown hair. The mouth was mobile and
sensitive, the chin small and firmly rounded, the
forehead broad, and the brows strongly marked.</p>

<p>The lady at her side, who was twice her age, was
of a totally different type. Handsome, certainly, but
weak and vain, possibly frivolous.</p>

<p><q>And so you are about to visit my country, Miss
Atherton,</q> said the Oriental, addressing the younger
lady, with a bow.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> she answered. <q>I'm going to live with my
father. He will meet me at Calcutta, and we shall
continue the journey together up the Ganges to
Ghazeepore. It will be so strange—so wonderful to
me. Of course it's familiar enough to you, Prince
Azimoolah.</q></p>

<pb n="12"/>
<p><q>Oh yes. Ah, you will like Ghazeepore—the
centre of the rose garden of India. Your roses in
England are nothing like those of Ghazeepore,
though you, Miss Atherton, can compare with any
rose that India can boast.</q></p>

<p>The compliment so direct would have sounded
vulgar and commonplace but for the smooth, liquid
voice in which it was expressed—a voice which, for
all its softness, sometimes uttered a jarring guttural
note which suggested that Azimoolah Khan could
on occasion speak in very different tones.</p>

<p><q>How nice of you, Prince, to say that!</q> exclaimed
the elder lady laughingly. <q>Don't you feel flattered,
Jean?</q></p>

<p>Jean Atherton's brown eyes had lowered beneath
the ardent gaze of the Oriental. She did not receive
the flattery in very good part.</p>

<p><q>I'd rather not be flattered, Lady Constance,</q>
said she. <q>Flattery is not always sincere.</q></p>

<p><q>I agree with you,</q> said the man, bending slightly
forward, his eyes fixed on the girl's face. <q>What I
said was not intended to be flattery. I hope, Miss
Atherton, it is not a crime to express admiration
of what is beautiful. The women of my race——</q></p>

<p>Prince Azimoolah suddenly stopped. The blare of
trumpets had cut his honeyed speech in two. Then
followed the shrill note of the fife, the peremptory
rattle of the side drum.</p>

<p>The startled horses reared, but were soon soothed
by the coachman, who drew the carriage on one side
of the road. A company of footguards was ap-
proaching from St James's Palace. It was coming
from the ceremony of the trooping of the colours.</p>

<p>The soldiers, many of them Crimean warriors, swept
<pb n="13"/>
by, their bayonets gleaming in the sunshine, their
coats and bearskins suggesting a moving solid
structure of red surmounted by a parapet of black.</p>

<p><q>How grandly they march!</q> cried Jean, forgetting
in her enthusiasm her momentary irritation.</p>

<p><q>And do they fight as grandly as they walk?</q>
inquired the Prince.</p>

<p>Azimoolah may not have intended the sneer in
his voice, but intentionally or not it was there.</p>

<p><q>Your countrymen ought to be able to answer
that question,</q> was the quick answer.</p>

<p>Prince Azimoolah laughed softly, but there was no
mirth in the eyes. Their velvety aspect was gone,
and a fierce glitter occupied its place.</p>

<p>The drums and fifes ceased for a minute or so, and
nothing was heard but the tramp of feet, as even and
as regular as the sound of a great machine. Then
the band burst into a joyous triumphant strain. The
tone of the brass was pleasant enough, but not so
weird, not so barbaric as that of the shrill fife, and
the musketlike rattle of the side drums.</p>

<p>The carriage proceeded towards St James's Palace.
Azimoolah Khan ceased to pay compliments—ceased
his flow of small-talk. His eyes were fixed on the
patch of red and black, gradually becoming less and
less in the distance.</p>

<p>Jean Atherton felt constrained to follow his gaze.
She too watched the departing soldiers. Their
regular tread could no longer be heard, though the
band had stopped. A brief silence followed. Why
should that silence suggest to Jean's imagination
something vaguely sinister? Her heart seemed to
beat more slowly, but only for a few seconds. The
next minute the ear-piercing fife penetrated the air
<pb n="14"/>
again, shrill, insistent, not wailing. It was like a
woman's call to arms, to be answered by the drums.</p>

<p>The sounds died away. The carriage passed out
of the park into Pall Mall. The windows of some
of the clubhouses were open. At one was a group
of retired Anglo-Indian officers, pensioned East
India Company's officials, and others, tempted from
the study of the newspapers to enjoy the fresh spring
air and bright sunlight.</p>

<p><q>What's this trouble about the greased cartridges
in India?</q> said an old gentleman, a county magnate
up in town with his wife and daughter, for the pre-
sentation of the latter at Court. <q>You've got Indian
matters at your fingers' ends, General Patterson, I'd
like to be posted up in the subject. Is the thing
likely to become serious, as some of the newspapers
seem to fear?</q></p>

<p><q>English newspapers know nothing about India.
At the same time, the business must be handled
carefully. I'll give you the story in a nutshell.
You've heard about the new Enfield rifle of course.
The top of the cartridge for this rifle has to be bitten
off before insertion into the barrel. Now it's got
about that bullocks' fat is used in the preparation of
these cartridges, and as it's a grievous sin for the
Hindoo to touch bullocks' fat, you can imagine the
hubbub among the sepoys.</q></p>

<p><q>Very absurd all these religious prejudices,</q> said
the county magnate pompously. <q>I thought our
missionaries were knocking that nonsense out of
the natives.</q></p>

<p><q>My dear Hubbard, when you knock a Hindoo's
religion out of him, you knock out his life as well.
His religion is part of his life. You in England who
<pb n="15"/>
save your religion up for Sundays don't understand
that.</q></p>

<p><q>That's true,</q> said a yellow-faced, shrivelled-up
old gentleman, a director of the Honourable East
India Company. <q>Now that we're on the subject,
I'd like to read you an extract from a letter as to
how the greased-cartridge trouble began. A soldier
walking to his cooking place to prepare his food was
met by a low caste man. The sepoy had with him
his <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">lopah</foreign>, or brass pot, full of water—and the low
caste fellow asked for a drink. The soldier was
a Brahmin. Said he: <q>I have scoured my <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="reoman">lopah</foreign>.
You will defile it by your touch.</q> The refusal
annoyed the other, and he replied jeeringly: <q>You
think much of your caste, but wait a little. The
sahib-log [the masterman] will make you bite
cartridges soaked in fat, and then where will your
caste be?</q> That's how the story goes, Mr Hubbard.
Of course I don't know if it's true, but my corre-
spondent says everybody in Calcutta is talking about
it.</q></p>

<p><q>And is fat really used in making these cart-
ridges?</q> asked the county magnate.</p>

<p><q>I don't think that matters a rap,</q> cut in the
General impatiently. <q>If the fellows once get the
idea into their heads, it'll be deuced hard to drive it
out. I'm afraid there's something afoot deeper than
greased cartridges. If my suspicions are correct,
anything will do for an excuse to bring the discon-
tent to a head.</q></p>

<p><q>Surely, General, you don't dread a revolt!</q> ex-
claimed the startled magnate.</p>

<p><q>A British soldier dreads nothing, sir,</q> returned
the General, a little nettled. <q>At the same time, he
<pb n="16"/>
ought to look matters fairly in the face. I'm not
in the Company's service now, but I thought it my
duty to lay my views before the directors the other
day, and you know how I was received, Sir Oliver.</q></p>

<p><q>My dear General,</q> rejoined the yellow-faced
gentleman, <q>you were quite right to give us the
benefit of your advice, but you're an alarmist, you
know. A revolt amongst the native troops is un-
thinkable. We've read 'em too many lessons in the
past for that.</q></p>

<p><q>The past isn't the present,</q> retorted the General.
<q>The forward policy of Lord Dalhousie, with
which of course I agree, though I don't like the way
it was carried out, has placed a tremendous responsi-
bility on the small British army which the East
India Company has hitherto found sufficient. The
addition of the kingdom of Oudh has made an
enormous difference. There's a good deal of sullen
dissatisfaction. It's known to exist in Lucknow.
The failure of the King of Oudh to get any redress
when he visited England last year hasn't done us
any good with the natives—but there, I won't be
a prophet of evil. We shall pull through all right
no doubt.</q></p>

<p><q>I should think so, indeed,</q> said a retired Com-
missioner. <q>This cartridge business will soon die
out. We shall hear no more of it in a month or
two's time. In any case, we haven't anything to be
afraid of in the sepoys. What do you think,
General?</q></p>

<p><q>Left to themselves, sir, they're not much.
Officered by our fellows, they make splendid soldiers.
I'm not afraid of the sepoys. I believe the majority
are absolutely faithful. But behind them—the subtle
<pb n="17"/>
intriguers—the silent plotters—the—— Well—by
Jove!</q></p>

<p>Everyone stared at the white-haired General.
The transition in tone, in manner, was so sudden
What had happened? He was staring into the
street at the occupants of an open carriage. The
carriage containing Prince Azimoolah, Lady Con-
stance Harwood, and Jean Atherton had stopped
opposite the clubhouse. Lady Constance had re-
cognised a friend, a young man on the pavement,
and he was standing at the side of the carriage
talking to her.</p>

<p>Azimoolah had his eyes turned towards the club-
house. The rage of the old soldier seemed to amuse
him mightily. He stared insolently into the open
window.</p>

<p><q>Gad—d'you see that black rascal?</q> stormed the
General. <q>I've a mind to drag him out of the
carriage and give him a thrashing. Surely those
women can't know who he is.</q></p>

<p><q>Eh—what?</q> exclaimed the magnate. <q>Surely
you don't mean Prince Azimoolah. Why——</q></p>

<p><q>Prince? He's no more a prince than you are,
sir,</q> burst out the irate warrior.</p>

<p><q>Well, but he was introduced to me as Prince
Azimoolah and by the very lady who's sitting in
that carriage—Lady Constance Harwood.</q></p>

<p><q>Then if Lady Constance doesn't know better,
someone ought to tell her. Look here, the last time
I saw that fellow he was a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign>. If you
don't know what a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign> is, Mr Hubbard,
I'll tell you. A <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar's</foreign> a waiter at table, a
fellow you'd kick if he didn't attend to you properly.
He's a devilish clever rascal, mind you—knows
<pb n="18"/>
English and French thoroughly, and somehow
became a teacher in the Cawnpore Government
schools. I'd heard a Prince Azimoolah was in
London two years ago, on behalf of that Seereck
Dhoondoo Punth who now dubs himself Nana Sahib
but I hadn't the least idea this so-called prince was
Azimoolah Khan. Were you aware of it, Sir Oliver?</q></p>

<p><q>Not I,</q> rejoined the director. <q>All I know
is that when Nana Sahib aired his grievance against
the Company, he sent yonder man to lay his case
before the directors, and very well the fellow did
it. Whether he's a prince or a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign>, it can't
affect the merits of the question.</q></p>

<p><q>Perhaps not,</q> retorted the General, <q>but he's
an impostor, and it's time he was exposed. I've
heard of him buzzing about in the best society with
the women actually running after him. By George,
it's too bad. Look at Lady Constance. If the
rascal were the Emperor of the French, she couldn't
be more languishing. The girl sitting opposite the
fellow doesn't seem so impressed—thank goodness!</q></p>

<p>The carriage by this time had moved, Azimoolah
never shifting his insolent glance so long as he could
look without trouble to himself.</p>

<p>The talk about Nana Sahib of Cawnpore continued.
Sir Oliver Markham, as a director of the East India
Company, of course was well up in the history of the
man whose name was afterwards to become a synonym
for all that is ferocious and bloodthirsty.</p>

<p>Nana Sahib, he explained, was the son of a corn-
dealer of Poona. Bajee Rao, the last of the
Mahratta kings, who was childless, adopted him as
his heir. The British Government dethroned Bajee
Rao and liberally pensioned him. When Bajee Rao
<pb n="19"/>
died, Nana Sahib expected the pension would be
continued. According to the Hindoo law, he was
entitled to claim this, notwithstanding that he was
not the son of the late King. The East India
Company ignored the Hindoo law, and cut off the
pension; hence the object of Azimoolah Khan's
visit to London.</p>

<p><q>And you say he argued the case well?</q> asked
the General.</p>

<p><q>Very well indeed. We all thought he was
exceedingly plausible. Certainly his manners were
charming. His first visit to England was soon after the
death of Lord Raglan in the Crimea. I should like
to know what's brought Azimoolah here again.
We've seen nothing of him in Leadenhall Street.
But of course he knows it's of no use coming. We
refused to grant Nana Sahib his pension two years
ago, and we certainly sha'n't reopen the question.</q></p>

<p>The curiosity of Sir Oliver Markham as to the
object of Azimoolah Khan's second visit to London
was natural. Azimoolah Khan pretended it was the
attractions of England, especially the attractions
of the English ladies, which had brought him to
London a second time. This was a falsehood. The
failure of his negotiations with the East India
Company had embittered him against England, and
he returned to India breathing vengeance.</p>

<p>He journeyed back to India <foreign>via</foreign> Constantinople,
arriving there just when the prospects of the Crimean
War were gloomy, and when the opinion was
gaining ground in the East that the struggle with
Russia had crippled the resources of England.</p>

<p>On his arrival, he comforted the Nana for his
disappointment by telling him the English were
<pb n="20"/>
ruined, and that one decisive blow would destroy
their rule in the East. And then he set to work
to foment rebellion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lady Constance Harwood's carriage
stopped in front of a house in Lowndes Square, and
Azimoolah Khan assisted the ladies to alight.</p>

<p><q>You'll stay to lunch, Prince?</q> said Lady
Constance.</p>

<p>A glance full of meaning shot from her pale blue eyes.</p>

<p>Azimoolah bowed assent.</p>

<p><q>How nice it is you're not a Hindoo,</q> went on the
lady. <q>I shouldn't know in the least what to give
you to eat. And if I did, I suppose you'd lunch and
dine by yourself?</q></p>

<p>Azimoolah's white teeth gleamed for an instant.
He laughed grimly. He was a Mohammedan.</p>

<p>It was clear Azimoolah received the invitation with
intense pleasure. At lunch he was most agreeable,
even fascinating. Jean Atherton was compelled to
own this.</p>

<p>But his charm of manner did not overcome her
innate dislike of the man, and when Lady Constance
rose she rose also.</p>

<p>A frown went over her ladyship's insipid face.</p>

<p><q>Don't leave the Prince. He'll think it so rude,</q>
she whispered sharply.</p>

<p><q>But he's your friend, not mine,</q> returned Jean.
<q>I've no end of letters to write this afternoon, and I
want to catch to-night's mail.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, very well—as you like.</q></p>

<p>The acidity in the lady's voice crept in very easily.
She was subject to what she called <soCalled>nerves.</soCalled> She
was readily irritated, and could not help showing her
irritation.</p>

<pb n="21"/>
<p>Jean's excuse was no fictitious one. She had been
at boarding school until she was eighteen, and had
hosts of friends among her schoolfellows.</p>

<p><soCalled>Finishing</soCalled> schools were an institution of the
fifties. The very superior ladies who presided over
these establishments had very superior ideas. As
a rule they bowed down to rank and only tolerated
wealth when it had not been acquired by shopkeeping.
Mr Atherton, a widower, had to trust his daughter
to the care of the Misses Dunkerley of Clapham and
without a doubt these amiable if somewhat narrow-
minded ladies fulfilled the trust faithfully, according
to their lights.</p>

<p>After Jean's stay at the <soCalled>finishing</soCalled> school, it was
necessary to find someone to chaperon her. The
period was that of the <soCalled>young person.</soCalled> The <soCalled>young
person</soCalled> has ceased to exist, and to-day Jean would
have gone to a boarding house without any fuss or
bother.</p>

<p>Not so in the fifties. Girls of nineteen were
supposed to be unable to look after themselves, so,
in accordance with Mr Atherton's instructions, the
Misses Dunkerley sought for some lady who for an
<soCalled>honorarium</soCalled> would consent to take charge of Jean
until the time of her departure arrived.</p>

<p>The simple-minded ladies, firmly believing that
anyone belonging to the aristocracy must necessarily
possess all the virtues, thought themselves highly
fortunate in securing the services of Lady Constance
Harwood. No one could deny that she was the
daughter of the Earl of Rockingham. If the Earl
ran through his fortune and ended by breaking his
neck in the hunting field, leaving little more than his
entailed estates to represent his worldly possessions
<pb n="22"/>
that was not the fault of Lady Constance Harwood.
But it was the reason why she condescended to take
care of Jean Atherton. The lady might have had
the bluest of blood, but she also had the slenderest of
purses.</p>

<p>Of course dear good Misses Dunkerley had not
the slightest idea that Lady Constance Harwood
was an inveterate gambler. Love of play ran in the
blood of the Harwoods, and her ladyship, when luck
went against her, had to live on her wits.</p>

<p>Jean was not long in making this discovery, and it
was always a puzzle to her how her ladyship con-
trived to secure the best of everything, even when
there was not the least prospect of paying for it.
Whatever the solution of the problem might be,
Lady Constance kept it to herself.</p>

<p>Perhaps Azimoolah Khan could have thrown a
little light on the mystery, in so far as the last six
months were concerned. It was Lady Constance
who introduced him into society. He was the lion
she was only too glad to exhibit. She procured him
invitations to balls, concerts, <foreign>fêtes</foreign>, and the assemblies
which served as <soCalled>At Homes</soCalled> half-a-century ago.</p>

<p>Azimoolah Khan found Lady Constance very
useful. The Nana had supplied him with unlimited
funds, and Lady Constance for once in her life had
the pleasurable experience of handling money, and
of knowing that she could get more by asking for it.</p>

<p>Her ladyship was always wanting more, so much
so that Azimoolah Khan was beginning to show
signs of reluctance. Lady Constance, anxious to keep
the Indian in good humour, tried all she could to
make use of Jean to this end. So shrewd a woman
was not likely to be blind to the evident admiration
<pb n="23"/>
Azimoolah had for the fresh young English girl.
To-day her manoeuvres to leave Jean alone to
entertain the Prince had failed. When after her
defeat she returned to Azimoolah, her lips were white
with rage.</p>

<p><q>You're disturbed, Lady Constance,</q> said Azi-
moolah smoothly.</p>

<p><q>Yes. You saw what happened. Why didn't you
come to my assistance? I'm doing my best for you
with her, but of course I dare not let her suspect
anything. I thought you men of the East were rapid
in your conquests.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> returned Azimoolah, a hard glitter in his
eyes, <q>when the time comes for conquest. We lay
our plans beforehand, and we wait—oh, for a long
while, till we are quite ready.</q></p>

<p><q>And while you're waiting, someone intervenes.
In six weeks' time Jean will start for India.</q></p>

<p><q>And I also.</q></p>

<p><q>You?</q> cried Lady Constance angrily. <q>But
you told me the other day you intended to stay in
England for quite three months more.</q></p>

<p><q>So I thought. But my plans are altered. I
shall travel in the same steamer as Miss Atherton.
Do you understand?</q></p>

<p>He smiled. Lady Constance bit her lips. Her
sources of income were coming to an end sooner
than she expected.</p>

<p><q>I suppose,</q> she went on, a little ironically, <q>you
would rather that Jean didn't know of your inten-
tion. It would come better as a surprise, would it
not?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes—as a pleasant surprise.</q></p>

<p><q>Then I musn't tell her.</q></p>

<pb n="24"/>
<p>The Indian fixed his eyes upon the lady. His
penetrating gaze confused her. It was as much as
to say, <q>How much do you want for holding your
tongue?</q></p>

<p><q>No, you musn't tell her,</q> said he presently. <q>I
fear you've been put to a great deal of trouble and
expense in my interest lately. May I venture to
acknowledge your services in some way?</q></p>

<p><q>Really, Prince, already you've been most gener-
ous,</q> said the lady deprecatingly.</p>

<p>Azimoolah shrugged his shoulders. He took from
his pocket-book a bundle of banknotes and passed
them to her across the table.</p>

<p>It would have been bad taste to unfold them.
Lady Constance contented herself with thanking
Azimoolah, and left the notes on the table where he
had placed them.</p>

<p>The Indian rose to go.</p>

<p><q>It is understood—silence?</q></p>

<p><q>Why, of course.</q></p>

<p>The next Indian mail brought a letter from Mr
Atherton to his daughter in which he said:</p>

<p><q>I shall be in Calcutta earlier than I expected,
and you must come by the first steamer after you
receive this letter.</q></p>

<p>The letter arrived within a week after Lady
Constance Harwood's compact with Azimoolah
Khan. Lady Constance at once called at Azimoo-
lah's hotel, to find that he had gone a journey. The
hotel people believed he was at Brighton, but were
not sure. At any rate he left no address and they
did not know when he would return.</p>

<p>Lady Constance waited three days, and during
that time did all in her power to delay Jean.
<pb n="25"/>
But the girl was determined. She was only too
glad to get away from her ladyship and from
Azimoolah Khan. The next P. &amp; O. steamer left
Southampton the following week, and she deter-
mined to go by it. Nothing could turn her from
her purpose. Lady Constance was almost angry at
her obstinacy, but for the lady's anger Jean cared
but little. She put it down to the fact that Lady
Constance would lose her income by her departure.
Her ladyship accompanied the girl to Waterloo
Station, and parted from her there with an effusive-
ness more fashionable than sincere.</p>

<p>The following day Azimoolah Khan returned to
the hotel. He found awaiting him a letter from
Lady Constance Harwood, scolding him for leaving
London at the very time when his presence was
most needed.</p>

<p><q>I believe Jean Atherton is really inclined
favourably towards you,</q> wrote the lady. <q>You
don't understand English girls. They are brought
up to say no when they mean yes. You've lost
your chance of becoming her <foreign xml:lang="fr">compagnon de voyage.</foreign>
I helped you all I could, but I can't do impossi-
bilities. You must follow up your conquest in
India.</q></p>

<p>At the end of the letter was a postscript:</p>

<p><q>I open this to tell you I have just heard that the
steamer with Jean on board was delayed at Fal-
mouth for a couple of days. Something wrong with
the engines. By travelling <foreign>via</foreign> Marseilles, I'm told,
you may join her at Cairo. But you must start at
once.</q></p>

<pb n="26"/>
<p>He did not need her ladyship's hint. There
were other motives besides the pursuit of Jean
Atherton which hastened Azimoolah Khan's de-
parture from England. The time was fast approach-
ing when the long meditated blow which was to
shake the English rule in India to its very founda-
tions was to be struck.</p>

<p>He hurried away; to reach Cairo the day after
Jean had departed.</p>

<head type="main">Signs of the Coming Storm—The Mysterious
Chupatties</head>

<p>The scene was the deck of a Ganges steamer, pro-
tected from the scorching rays of the sun by a
substantial roof of wood. The picture beneath that
roof was a pretty one, both in form and colour.</p>

<p>A slim, graceful English girl, dressed in white, her
little slippered feet resting on an Eastern rug of
gorgeous tints and grotesque design, was resting in
a deck-chair, an open book upon her lap.</p>

<p>The man sitting at her side one could see at a
glance was her father. He had the same refined
features, the same deep-set, shining eyes, the same
pitch of the voice.</p>

<p><q>Shall we reach Ghazeepore in good time do you
think, papa?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes; we ought to unless we get stuck on a sand-
bank—a not at all unlikely thing. It's a pity we
have to travel at this season of the year, or we might
have gone straight up the Hooghly into the Ganges.
As it is, we must go through the channels of the
Sunderbunds and that will make a difference of
nearly a thousand miles. But it doesn't much
matter, everything moves slowly here.</q></p>

<p>The Sunderbunds comprise the vast labyrinth of
small islands, intersected by lagoons, that form the
delta of the Ganges.</p>

<pb n="28"/>
<p>For six days the cumbrous steamer, dragging
behind it a flat loaded with cargo, had been thread-
ing tortuous streams steaming from one lagoon into
another, until the eye became tired of the monotony
of the perpetual verdure to be seen on either side.
On the seventh day the vessel entered the Ganges.
Hills were just visible in the distance, but the river
itself glided through a dead level of country—so
level, indeed, that it was almost difficult to tell which
way the current flowed.</p>

<p>The cool breezes which swept over the vessel when
it left Calcutta had long since died away. Now and
again came the breath of the <q>hot wind,</q> an omin-
ous precursor of what was to follow later on. This
<q>hot wind</q> was a new experience to Jean. It
seemed to scorch everything it touched, and was
loaded with a fine dust, filling eyes, ears, nostrils,
and even pockets. The verdure of the delta gave
place to long, wide stretches of white sand, looking
in the glaring sunshine almost like snow.</p>

<p>The river journey had, indeed, become terribly try-
ing. What with the stifling heat and the attentions
of the mosquitoes, it was almost impossible to sleep.</p>

<p>From Patna to Ghazeepore, the journey was
extremely tedious. It occupied nearly a week, the
steamer grounding several times, and each time
lying obstinately on its sandbank for hours.</p>

<p>At Ghazeepore, where they landed, came a welcome
change of scene from the eternal river and the narrow
confines of the steamer. They were now in the dis-
trict famed for its rose-water. Hundreds of acres of
rose bushes were just bursting into flower, the air
was pure and sweet, and there were not quite so
many mosquitoes and flies.</p>

<pb n="29"/>
<p>Jean Atherton was in good spirits, and quite ready
for her new experience—travelling by dak to
Lucknow.</p>

<p>At Ghazeepore they stayed at the house of Mr
Gibson, a representative of the East India Company,
and an old colleague of Mr Atherton, and it did not
need much shrewdness on the part of Jean to note
the sense of anxiety which seemed to pervade the
household. Her father's manner was no longer that
of the placid, well-to-do official, secure in the receipt
of a large salary, and assured of a comfortable pen-
sion for his declining days. He held long conversa-
tions in an undertone with his host; but of the
nature of the talk Jean knew or understood nothing.</p>

<p>Mr Atherton had had six months' leave of
absence from Lucknow, and much had taken place
in the interim.</p>

<p>On the day following their arrival at Ghazeepore
a curious circumstance transpired. Jean was out
walking with her father and Mr Gibson in the early
morning, when she saw a native accost another and
place something formally in his hand. At the same
moment Mr Gibson suddenly stopped speaking, in
the middle of a sentence, and, stepping quickly
across the road, passed close to the two natives.
The natives immediately separated, and in a minute
or two Mr Gibson rejoined Jean and her father.</p>

<p><q>Atherton,</q> said Gibson abruptly, <q>did you see
that?</q></p>

<p><q>I did,</q> returned Mr Atherton, in a low voice.
<q>Was it the passing of the chupatties?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. That fellow who handed the chupatty
does not belong to Ghazeepore. He is a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">chowkedar</foreign>
[village policeman] of Buxar. I heard him say to
<pb n="30"/>
one man: <q>Make ten more, and give two each to
the nearest <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">chowkedars</foreign>, with the same orders.</q></q></p>

<p><q>I don't like that,</q> said Mr Atherton uneasily.</p>

<p><q>Like it?</q> exclaimed Gibson emphatically.
<q>It's dam—— I beg your pardon, Miss Atherton—
deuced bad. I hope it doesn't mean mischief.</q></p>

<p>Jean looked from one to the other. She saw alarm
written in the faces of the two men.</p>

<p><q>Has anything happened, papa?</q> she asked anxi-
ously.</p>

<p><q>Oh no; and nothing may happen. Those things
which you saw the one man hand to the other were
little unleavened cakes, called chupatties. They are
eaten by every native from one end of India to the
other. When there is something unusual imminent
and the people have to be warned to be in readiness,
these cakes are passed from hand to hand as you ob-
served just now. These chupatties are only used by
the civilians. In the case of soldiers, a lotus leaf is
employed.</q></p>

<p><q>But I don't understand,</q> said Jean. <q>You say
the people are warned to be in readiness. In readi-
ness for what?</q></p>

<p><q>Ah,</q> returned her father, drawing a long breath,
<q>if we only knew! Gibson,</q> said he, turning to his
friend, <q>we must lose no time in getting to Lucknow.
Sir Henry Lawrence ought to be told of this.</q></p>

<p><q>You're quite right, old friend. The dak shall be
in readiness to-morrow morning.</q></p>

<p>Mr Gibson was as good as his word, and the next
day Jean found herself jolting towards Lucknow in a
kind of palanquin running on four high wheels, and
drawn by a single horse.</p>

<p>Mr Atherton judged it prudent to disguise the
<pb n="31"/>
truth no longer from his daughter, and for the first
time Jean learned that all the Europeans in the
stations and cities of the North-West Provinces were
becoming conscious that grave trouble was impending,
though from what quarter it would first proceed it
was impossible to foresee.</p>

<p>Jean and her father reached Lucknow in little
more than a week. The journey should not have
taken them so long, but the roads were bad, and the
horses in ill condition. In spite of the benedictions
maledictions, persuasions, and commands of the
drivers, supplemented with a liberal application of
whip-cord, not more than five and twenty miles could
be covered in a day, and Jean was heartily sick of
travelling by dak by the time the towers of the
palaces and the minarets of the mosques of Lucknow
came in view.</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous afternoon in the early part of
May when they arrived in the capital, and at that
season of the year the climate is very trying to
Europeans. All the day the scorching rays of the
sun had been terribly oppressive, and the wind
seemed as though it had passed through a furnace.</p>

<p>They approached the city from the south-east,
skirting the beautiful park which surrounds Dilkoosha,
the magnificent hunting-box, or country seat, built
by Saadat Ali Khan, King of Oudh. The sun had
already begun to decline, and the white stone of the
distant palaces, so dazzling in midday, was bathed
in a crimson glow. The towers and pinnacles cast
long, frowning shadows upon the ground.</p>

<p><q>In half-an-hour we shall be at home,</q> said Mr
Atherton. The heat of the day was over, and he
was walking by the side of Jean's carriage.</p>

<pb n="32"/>
<p>The girl started. It seemed so strange that hence-
forth her home should be in this glowing Oriental
city, where the life of to-day was so strangely tinged
by the poetry, the romance, the tradition, and the
mysticism of the past.</p>

<p><q>Do you see that building on the right, with the
tall column in front? That is called <q>La Martinière,</q>
after the name of its founder, General Claude Martin,
who eighty years ago was in the service of the King
of Oudh,</q> said Mr Atherton.</p>

<p>The dak was stopped for a few moments, that Jean
might view the building the better. Superb and
impressive it certainly was, for the distance concealed
the details of its fantastic and grotesque architecture.
In front of the building, rising from the placid
waters of the lake, was a lofty column, quite plain in
its ornamentation in comparison with the barbaric
luxuriance of the structure behind.</p>

<p>The setting sun dyed the waters of a blood-red,
the column threw a rigid shadow, black as ink, across
the crimson. There was something sinister in the
startling contrast of colour. Jean was strangely
impressed. A feeling of uneasiness, almost of fore-
boding, crept over her.</p>

<p>Presently they crossed the Dilkoosha bridge, span-
ning the canal. This canal, she noticed, had no
water in it. It was simply a gigantic ditch with a
sandy bed.</p>

<p><q>Ah,</q> said her father, <q>that canal is a type of
a good many things in India. It was commenced in
the reign of one of the old kings of Oudh, and was
intended to run from the Ganges for the purpose of
irrigating the country between Lucknow and Cawn-
pore. Only a few miles had been excavated when
<pb n="33"/>
funds failed. The fact was, the contractors simply
took all the money they could lay their hands upon
and decamped. Honest, wasn't it? And so you see
the reason of that dry ditch, which, so far as I know,
is good for nothing.</q></p>

<p>They were now in the city of Lucknow. The
streets, long and narrow, were teeming with life.
The picturesque costumes gave a wonderful anima-
tion and picturesqueness to the scene. Unlike the
Bengalese, the men of Oudh are often tall and stal-
wart, and the women graceful and of noble carriage.
There were many of these, and mingling with them
were beggars of the vile and squalid aspect peculiar
to the East.</p>

<p>No city is more remarkable for the variety of its
inhabitants and the mixed character of its architec-
ture than Lucknow, and at every turn were scenes
glowing with real Oriental vividness of colouring.</p>

<p>Mr Atherton's house was not far from the Resi-
dency, the headquarters of the Chief Commissioner,
Sir Henry Lawrence. It was a bungalow of con-
siderable size. When the carriage drew up in
front of the verandah a host of servants, squatting
in the shade, came forward with low salaams, and
with noise and gesticulation began to unpack the
luggage.</p>

<p><q>There's the household—or at least a part of it,</q>
said Mr Atherton laughingly. <q>You must do your
best to govern them, Jean. Hitherto I fancy they've
governed me. You'll find they like their own way
better than anything else in the world.</q></p>

<p>Jean looked with dismay at the row of dusky faces,
some grave, some smiling, and wondered how she
should get on. Though she could speak a little
<pb n="34"/>
Hindustani, she could scarcely say she was at home
in the language.</p>

<p>When at eight o'clock she went down to dinner
the moon was shining with that clear, pale, silvery
light seen only in the East. The lamps had not
been lighted, for fear of attracting the mosquitoes
and other pests of Indian life. Jean went into the
verandah where her father was slowly pacing to and
fro, his hands clasped behind him, his head bent in
thought.</p>

<p>She touched his arm. He started.</p>

<p><q>I haven't frightened you, have I, papa?</q></p>

<p><q>Frightened me? Of course not, my dear,</q> he
replied a little hesitatingly. <q>Come,</q> said he, sud-
denly changing his tone, <q>let us go into dinner.
Our first meal in our own house must be a happy
one.</q></p>

<p>Atherton drew his daughter's hand within his arm,
and led her into the room. It was flooded with
moonlight and everything was almost as distinct as
in the daytime.</p>

<p>Whether from the strangeness of the scene, or the
vague feeling of unrest which seemed to permeate
the very atmosphere, or from her own sense of
inexperience and insufficiency for the duties that
awaited her, the fair girl sighed deeply as she seated
herself for the repast, and her father, who read his
own meaning into the wordless expression, looked
down lovingly upon her, and seeing her mother in
her face, stooped and kissed it with feelings which
hovered betwixt hope and fear.</p>

<p>A dinner by moonlight is an unnatural sort of
thing. On Atherton clapping his hands, half-a-
dozen servants, all barefooted, came in. While one
<pb n="35"/>
man lit the lamps, others pulled down the blinds and
drew the gauze curtains across the windows.</p>

<p>Mr Atherton was full of talk during the dinner,
but it seemed to the keen perception of his daughter
that his gaiety was forced. Whenever there was a
pause in the conversation, his eyes became uneasy
and were fixed upon her with a look in them she had
never seen before.</p>

<p>She knew her father had been in the Residency
since their arrival, and she wondered if he had heard
any disquieting news. She hardly dared to ask
him.</p>

<p><q>We ought to take stock of our domestics, and
see how many we have really got,</q> said he. <q>Just
before I left for Calcutta I tried to reckon up. I
found I had a head-bearer, a mate-bearer, six under-
bearers, a cook, a gardener, a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="r">khansaman</foreign>, or butler,
three <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgars</foreign>, a water-carrier, a washerman, a
tailor, a coachman, two grooms, two grass-cutters,
and two messengers. I fancy others have been
added since. I must leave you to appoint your own
women staff.</q></p>

<p><q>The ayah I brought from Calcutta ought to be
enough for me, papa. I hate being fussed over by a
host of servants,</q> said Jean.</p>

<p>Her father laughed.</p>

<p><q>My dear, you'll have to get used to that. The
Hindoo believes firmly in a division of labour. The
bearer—the man, you know, who pulls the punkah—
won't take a plate off the table for love or money;
and no power on earth will induce the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign>,
or waiter, to pull the punkah. So what are you to
do?</q></p>

<p>Just then the sound of wheels and the tramp of a
<pb n="36"/>
horse was heard outside. A <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign> brought in
a card.</p>

<p><q>Dr Lennard,</q> exclaimed Mr Atherton. <q>Yes,
show the doctor in.</q></p>

<p>A young man, with a refined and intellectual
rather than a handsome face, entered hastily. He
paused a moment when he saw Jean, and bowed
low.</p>

<p><q>My daughter Jean—Dr Lennard,</q> said Mr
Atherton.</p>

<p><q>Why didn't you come earlier, Lennard, and dine
with us?</q> he continued, when the introduction was
complete.</p>

<p><q>I'd no intention of calling; but, visiting a patient
near here, he told me you had just arrived, so I
thought I'd look you up.</q></p>

<p><q>That's right; you'll be able to tell us the latest
news. Jean must be posted up in Lucknow fashion-
able gossip. She knows nobody yet. You're the
first resident to whom she's been introduced.</q></p>

<p><q>I esteem it an honour,</q> said the young man,
with his grave eyes fixed earnestly on Jean's hand-
some face. <q>I could have wished that Miss Atherton
had arrived at any time but the present—though, of
course, the loss would have been ours.</q></p>

<p><q>It's very nice of you to say that, Dr Lennard,</q>
said Jean smilingly; <q>but may I ask what is the
matter with the present time? Papa's convinced
that all fear of a disturbance is at an end, aren't
you?</q></p>

<p>She turned suddenly upon her father, and once
more saw the uneasy expression which she had
noticed before in his eyes.</p>

<p><q>All fear? Yes, I think so—I hope so,</q> replied
<pb n="37"/>
her father slowly. Then, with an abruptness which
seemed to indicate that something was brooding in
his mind, he said: <q>Lennard, what's this story
about Dr Wells? I was at the Residency just now,
and heard one or two men speaking of it, but
couldn't get at the facts.</q></p>

<p><q>It's rather a serious business—more serious than
some seem to think. Dr Wells, as I daresay you
know, is the surgeon of the 48th Native Infantry,
and unintentionally he did what was rather an
unfortunate thing. Having occasion to visit the
medicine store of the hospital, and feeling at the
time indisposed, he incautiously applied to his mouth
a bottle containing a carminative. This bottle was
taken from the hospital medicines and the regimental
apothecary saw the act.</q></p>

<p><q>Put it to his mouth?</q> cried Mr Atherton. <q>How
confoundedly thoughtless!</q></p>

<p><q>You see, Miss Atherton,</q> continued Lennard,
turning to the girl, <q>this act was a defiance of the
rules of Hindoo caste. No high-caste Hindoo could
afterwards have partaken of the medicine contained
in the polluted bottle. Under ordinary circumstances
the incident might have been passed over as acci-
dental, but just now everything is twisted to support
the unlucky belief which has got abroad that we
want to upset the Hindoo religion. It so happened,
too, that the native apothecary who attended Dr
Wells was unfortunately on bad terms with him, and
immediately went and blurted out the thing among
the sepoys in the hospital. Well, of course, there was
a terrible bother.</q></p>

<p><q>And what was done?</q> said Mr Atherton, rising
from his chair and pacing up and down the room.</p>

<pb n="38"/>
<p><q>First of all there was an outcry, and not a patient
would touch any medicine. Upon that Colonel
Palmer assembled the native officers, and in their
presence destroyed the bottle which Dr Wells had
put to his lips, besides giving him a severe rebuke.</q></p>

<p><q>Colonel Palmer could hardly do more.</q></p>

<p><q>True: but the offence had been committed. The
men took their physic; but what happened? Dr
Wells' bungalow a few nights after was burnt down,
and everything inside destroyed. Wells himself
narrowly escaped with his life.</q></p>

<p><q>How wicked and revengeful!</q> exclaimed Jean
indignantly. <q>Were not the men who set fire to the
house punished?</q></p>

<p><q>Their guilt could never be brought home to them.
It was well known the incendiaries belonged to the
48th Regiment; but as no proofs could be obtained,
no punishment could be inflicted. They know in
India how to keep secrets,</q> said the young doctor,
with a grim smile.</p>

<p><q>It's terrible! Why, no one's life is safe if so
small a thing as this can lead to such frightful conse-
quences,</q> said the girl, fixing her large, liquid eyes
on Lennard's face. <q>I shall have to be very careful
I don't offend any of the servants; they might burn
this house down.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, it's not quite so bad as that. You mustn't
alarm yourself unnecessarily. Perhaps I ought not
to have mentioned this matter before you.</q></p>

<p><q>Why not?</q> cried Jean impulsively. <q>There can
be no good in keeping me in the dark. I know it's
the fashion for men to believe that women cannot
bear misfortune, and that directly bad news comes
we go into hysterics. They're wrong.</q></p>

<pb n="39"/>
<p><q>I am sure they are in your case!</q> rejoined Len-
nard, with emphasis.</p>

<p>Jean coloured slightly at the glance of admiration
which the doctor had directed towards her. The
conversation had taken an unexpectedly personal turn.</p>

<p><q>You don't think, then, Dr Lennard, that women
are cowards?</q></p>

<p><q>My experience has taught me just the reverse.
In the majority of cases they bear pain better than
men, and I believe in times of real danger they
display a courage and heroism quite equal; when
peril assails anyone they love, women will sometimes
dare more than men.</q></p>

<p><q>Is that really your opinion?</q> cried Jean, her eyes
glistening.</p>

<p><q>Yes. I only hope events won't put my opinion
to the proof.</q></p>

<p>The young doctor's manner, always earnest, took
a solemnity of tone which was strangely impressive.
It seemed to bring to Jean's mind all the forebodings
and disquieting presentiments which at times weighed
so heavily on her spirits. Lennard noticed her pensive
expression.</p>

<p><q>I've made you sad, Miss Atherton. I didn't
intend to play the part of the raven.</q></p>

<p><q>Lennard,</q> said Mr Atherton, suddenly breaking
into the conversation, <q>come to my room. I want
to talk things over with you. You can amuse your-
self while we are away, can't you, Jean? There's
the piano I had sent from Calcutta on purpose for
you. See whether it's in decent tune.</q></p>

<p><q>Mr Atherton,</q> said Lennard, in a low voice,
<q>is it a private matter you wish to speak to me
about?</q></p>

<pb n="40"/>
<p><q>In a way, yes; but not precisely so. I want to
get from you some idea of the exact position of
affairs here. You move about a good deal, you go
among the natives, and you probably know more
than the military authorities. I heard some very
ugly rumours at the Residency this evening.</q></p>

<p><q>Very likely. I'll give you my candid opinion.
Can't we talk here?</q></p>

<p><q>You forget Jean is fresh from England, and I
don't want to frighten her.</q></p>

<p><q>You won't do that. I think Miss Atherton ought
not to be left in the dark.</q></p>

<p><q>Eh? Well, perhaps you're right,</q> said Mr
Atherton, after a pause. He was looking at Jean
as he spoke, and noted her bright, eager, expressive,
intelligent face. Before her arrival at Calcutta he
had not seen his daughter for five years, when he
spent his last leave of absence in England. In the
interval she had, from a slim slip of a girl, blossomed
into all the glory and grace of womanhood. Possibly
when he suggested a private conversation with Dr
Lennard, he had Jean in his mind as she had been.
He was not yet accustomed to the Jean that was.</p>

<p><q>Jean dear,</q> said he quietly, <q>Dr Lennard's about
to tell us what has happened in Lucknow during the
last few weeks.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm sorry that what I have to say isn't more
pleasant,</q> began Lennard, his eyes fixed upon Jean's
eager face. <q>I'll put the story as briefly as I can.
First came the episode of the medicine bottle. After
this Sir Henry Lawrence began to take precautions,
and these he now continues. The arrangements for
the English troops were horribly inconvenient and
unsafe. Sir Henry has altered all that, and, besides
<pb n="41"/>
concentrating his forces, he is making the Residency
defensible in the event of the worst. You noticed,
Mr Atherton, I daresay, how all the huts and
outbuildings close to the house have been cleared
away.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh yes. I wondered what it meant.</q></p>

<p><q>That's to give sharpshooters no chance of cover.
The astute old chap has been slaving from morning
till night. He has laid in stores and ammunition,
arranged for a constant water supply and had the
treasure from the city and outlying stations moved
to the Residency, and outworks are gradually
being thrown up all round. Of course everything
has to be done cautiously. The sepoys are terribly
suspicious. In spite of the care taken, things came
to a head on the 3rd of May, when the 7th Regiment
of Oudh Irregular Infantry broke out. They first
refused to bite the new cartridges. Then, after
brooding over their grievances for a couple of days,
they arrived at the amiable conclusion that they must
kill their European officers. By Jove! Nothing but
the coolness of Adjutant Mecham averted a horrible
catastrophe.</q></p>

<p><q>Good heavens!</q> cried Atherton.</p>

<p><q>It was this way. The men were all on the
parade ground, and the officers were arguing with
them, when Mecham was taken unawares by the
mutineers, and told to prepare to die. <q>Very well,</q>
said he pluckily, <q>you may kill me; but what good
will my death do to you? Another adjutant will take
my place, and you will be subjected to the same
treatment you receive from me.</q> They seemed to
be struck with the force of the reasoning, didn't
injure him, and returned to their lines, but refused
<pb n="42"/>
to lay down their arms. Of course this insubordina-
tion couldn't be tolerated. So that very night the
7th were ordered up by Sir Henry, and told to give
up their weapons. They were surrounded by the
32nd Foot and a European battery, and they saw
the wisdom of obeying. The next day the ring-
leaders were arrested. Now to-morrow Sir Henry
holds a durbar, when rewards will be given to those
native officers who have given him information as to
what is going on. That's all I can tell you.</q></p>

<p>At that moment the voices of the servants sud-
denly broke into the conversation, and a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign>
ran in, his arms upraised, and crying:</p>

<p><q>Sahib! Sahib! Bad news!</q></p>

<p><q>What do you mean? What has happened?</q></p>

<p><q>Dhoonah Rah has just come from the bazaar.
He's been told the soldiers at Meerut have risen and
murdered their officers. The mem-sahibs, the
children have been killed.</q></p>

<p><q>The women and the children. Impossible!
Dhoonah Rah is either telling you lies, or has
himself been deceived!</q> cried Atherton.</p>

<p>The <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign> salaamed in a deprecatory
manner. He was too polite to contradict his
master, but it was evident he believed the story.</p>

<p><q>It can't be true! It's too horrible! Lennard,
what do you think?</q></p>

<p>Lennard glanced at Jean, whose face had suddenly
grown white.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> said he stoutly; <q>I don't believe the
soldiers would be guilty of such atrocities. Besides,
Meerut is two hundred miles away; the news could
scarcely reach us in so short a time.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know that,</q> said Atherton, a little
<pb n="43"/>
agitatedly. <q>The native runners are fleet of foot.
Intelligence is conveyed from village to village with
incredible swiftness. There's but one thing to be
done. You and I must go to the Residency and see
Sir Henry. You don't mind being left alone for
half-an-hour, Jean?</q></p>

<p><q>No, papa,</q> said the girl courageously. <q>You've
said there's nothing to fear.</q></p>

<p>Mr Atherton kissed his daughter, and hurried
away with Dr Lennard.</p>

<p>What a lifetime to Jean that short half-hour
seemed! She could settle down to nothing. She
tried the piano. The sounds jarred upon her
nerves. She took up a book. The letters danced
before her eyes.</p>

<p>Then she went into the verandah. Lucknow,
stretching six miles along the banks of the Ganges,
lay before her. The city seemed an endless vista of
towers, pinnacles, cupolas, turrets, roofs of every
size and shape sharply cutting the pale blue sky.
The white stone, wherever the moonbeams fell upon
it, looked like snow, the shadows were black as
ebony.</p>

<p>But save the whir of insects all was still. There
was nothing to cause her the least fear. Yet she
dared not leave the verandah. Somehow it seemed
safer there than inside the house. She could see
across the compound. If anyone approached, it
could not be without her knowledge.</p>

<p>And so the minutes passed till she saw, to her
relief, the tall, spare form of her father, side by side
with Lennard's more robust figure.</p>

<p>She could not restrain her impatience. She ran
to meet them.</p>

<pb n="44"/>
<p><q>Is the news true?</q> she cried anxiously. <q>Ah,
I can see by your faces it is!</q></p>

<p>Mr Atherton paused before he answered. Then
drawing a deep breath, he said:</p>

<p><q>Too true—unhappily, too true. It's time we in
Lucknow looked to ourselves. To-morrow, by Sir
Henry Lawrence's orders, all the European women
and children are to take up their quarters in the
Residency. We must make our preparations for
moving to-night. But don't frighten yourself, my
dear,</q> he added hastily. <q>It doesn't follow from
this order that we have anything to fear. Sir Henry
is cautious, and likes to be prepared for emergencies.
Take all the rest you can. We needn't start before
daybreak, and that'll be in four hours' time.</q></p>

<p><q>And what will you do, papa?</q> said she, placing
her hand in his.</p>

<p><q>I shall sit here. I feel too restless to sleep.</q></p>

<p><q>Shall I stay, Atherton?</q> asked Lennard. <q>I'd
better see you to the Residency. I don't apprehend
any danger, but I might be of service in case any-
thing should happen.</q></p>

<p><q>Thanks, Lennard, you're a good fellow,</q> rejoined
Atherton heartily.</p>

<p>The doctor's face brightened, not so much at the
words of Mr Atherton as at the grateful look of
thanks in the eloquent eyes of his daughter.</p>

<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="3">III</num></head>
<head type="main">The Storm Bursts</head>

<p>Jean retired to her room, but she found it impos-
sible to sleep. Tara, her ayah, was full of the
news. She had been out into the bazaar, where
the intelligence had spread like wildfire, exagger-
ated, doubtless, by the fervid imagination of the
natives.</p>

<p>The girl gathered that the news had come to
Lucknow from Agra, as all communication with
Meerut was cut off. A private telegraphic message,
sent by the sister of the Meerut postmaster to her
aunt at Agra, postponing a visit as disturbances had
broken out and officers had been killed, was the
first intimation given that matters had taken a
serious turn. The outbreak occurred about five
o'clock on Sunday; the message arrived at Agra at
nine. From that hour all was blank.</p>

<p>Towards morning after a fitful slumber Jean
awoke with a start and a half-suppressed scream.
Tara was moving about the room, making prepara-
tions for their departure, and the pale grey light of
dawn was stealing through the blinds.</p>

<p>She rose, and dressed hastily, and joined her
father and Lennard, when she found a pony carriage
was in readiness at the door.</p>

<p><q>We can't take much luggage,</q> said Mr Atherton.
<q>Just a change or two of clothing. I don't suppose
<pb n="46"/>
we shall remain at the Residency more than a week,</q>
he added.</p>

<p>So he thought, and so thought scores of others who
at that moment were on the same errand as himself.
Had they been told they were destined to be cooped
up in the Residency walls for six months they
would have laughed the idea to scorn.</p>

<p>Lucknow seemed more picturesque than ever in
the golden light of morning. The narrow streets
were already beginning to be thronged, but no one
took much notice of the pony carriage. They met
other vehicles containing Europeans proceeding
towards the Residency, and Atherton and Lennard
exchanged greetings with their many friends, but
nothing more. It was not safe to discuss their fears
in the streets. The worst thing to do was to show
any sign of timidity before the natives.</p>

<p>At last they arrived at the outer wall enclosing
a number of official buildings in the centre of which
was the imposing and elegant structure which gave
the name <q>The Residency</q> to the entire locality.</p>

<p>The Residency itself contained a vast number of
lofty and magnificently decorated rooms. Extensive
verandahs and noble porticoes were among its ex-
terior embellishments. Besides the accommodation
afforded by a ground floor and two upper storeys, it
possessed a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>, or excavated suite of hand-
some apartments, running under the whole super-
structure, and designed to shelter the inmates from
the intense heat of the -day. These apartments were
well lighted and ventilated by shafts and basement
windows. The extent of the ground occupied by
the Residency may be imagined from the fact that
from eight hundred to a thousand persons could
<pb n="47"/>
find accommodation within the building at one
time.</p>

<p>The Residency was situated on the highest point
of an elevated and irregular plateau, sloping down
sharply towards the river. At one of the angles of
the structure was an octagonal dome-crowned tower.
In the interior of this tower a spiral staircase of fine
proportions led to the terraced roof, from which an
extensive view of the whole city could be obtained.
This tower was of the utmost use during the soul-
stirring events which followed thick and fast after
the month of May.</p>

<p>Within the Residency all was confusion. Ladies
and children were arriving every five minutes, and
doing their best to locate themselves in various parts
of the building. The accommodation, ample as it was,
proved none too large, especially as one spacious
room had to be converted into a sort of hospital
ward for the sick men of the 32nd Regiment, who
were being rapidly brought up in <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dhoolies</foreign>.</p>

<p>Every day showed Sir Henry Lawrence untiring
in his exertions. He mixed personally among the
native troops, and tried to find out their real feelings.
He could discover nothing to cause alarm. Yet
there might be disaffected men, and these he deter-
mined to conciliate by holding a durbar, at which
rewards and presents should be distributed.</p>

<p>Not the least precaution did Sir Henry neglect.
At once he began to concentrate the little European
force at his command, and reduce the number of
stations, so that in the event of an outbreak the
Europeans might not be cut off in detail.</p>

<p><q>We had eight posts,</q> he wrote on the 20th of
May, to Sir Hugh Wheeler, who at Cawnpore was
<pb n="48"/>
preparing for the worst. <q>As Sir C. Napier would
say, we are like chips in porridge. We have given
up four posts, and greatly strengthened three.</q></p>

<p>The chief of these three posts was the Mutchee-
bhawun. This fort, which derives its name of Mutchee
(fish) from the device over the gateway, and Bhawun
(Sanscrit for house), occupied a commanding position
to the west of the city which it overlooked. Cannon
was at once planted on its walls, and where that
could not be done, the deficiency was supplied with
<soCalled>jingals,</soCalled> or immense blunderbusses moving on
pivots.</p>

<p>There is an old tradition that he who holds the
Mutcheebhawun might in time of trouble safely
reckon upon an army as numerous as the fish in the
Gumti to rally round his standard. This tradition
did not influence Sir Henry Lawrence. He was
more inclined to believe in the assertion of the
natives that, if the fire of our own guns did not bring
down the place about our ears, the fire of an enemy
would soon convert it into a ruin. It was very ancient
and difficult to make secure.</p>

<p>It was determined to convert this capacious edifice
into a great storehouse and arsenal. Provisions of
all kinds were brought and carefully stored in it.
All the available ordnance and ammunition were
collected and secured. The buildings surrounding
the Residency, dangerous for the shelter they might
afford an assailant, were demolished. Nothing but
a regard for the religion of the natives induced
Sir Henry to allow the mosques, from which a fire
might be directed upon the Residency with terrible
effect, to remain. He had before long occasion to
bitterly repent his forbearance.</p>

<pb n="49"/>
<p>Within a week all the ladies and children were
lodged in the Residency, and by degrees something
like order was secured. The gardens in which the
buildings were situated were spacious, and there was
no need to go outside the walls for exercise.</p>

<p>Despite the confirmation of the alarming news
from Meerut, Sir Henry Lawrence resolved not to
depart from his conciliatory policy, and the durbar
was held as he had arranged, in front of the Resi-
dency bungalow, in the cantonments about three
miles from the city proper.</p>

<p>The time chosen was sunset, and Sir Henry
Lawrence, attended by all his military and civil
officers, met the officers of the native army. Address-
ing them in Hindustani, he appealed to their best
feelings as soldiers and as comrades.</p>

<p>It was an imposing scene. The lawn was carpeted;
the seats ranged for the visitors formed three sides of
a square. Behind them stood groups of sepoys,
eagerly watching the proceedings, and listening to
the words which fell from the venerable chief. And
visible to all were the dresses of honour and the trays
of presents that were to be given to the faithful
soldiers who had earned these rewards by their
loyalty and devotion.</p>

<p>The proceedings passed off quietly. The native
officers were loud in their professions of devotion to
the British Government, and it was hoped that all
danger was at an end.</p>

<p>The result was anxiously awaited by those in the
Residency. Mr Atherton was jubilant. He had
been present at the durbar, and was convinced that
the troops as well as the officers had been completely
won over.</p>

<pb n="50"/>
<p>He found his daughter and most of the other ladies
in the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>, the underground apartment already
described, whither they had gone owing to the intense
heat.</p>

<p><q>We shall be back in our own house in a day or
two,</q> he exclaimed.</p>

<p><q>Mr Martin Gubbins doesn't think so,</q> said a tall,
dark, handsome woman.</p>

<p>Mr Martin Gubbins was the commissioner for
Oudh.</p>

<p><q>Gubbins is an alarmist, Mrs Ross,</q> returned Mr
Atherton. <q>Why, he commenced fortifying his house
long before Sir Henry thought it necessary to send
you all into the Residency; and wasn't he laughed
at for doing it?</q></p>

<p><q>That may be,</q> replied the lady, with a languorous
air, <q>but Mr Gubbins is in a position to know best.
He wouldn't have taken his precautions without
good cause. I'm afraid the trouble isn't at an end.
I suppose I may be allowed to know something
about the Hindoo nature. When the storm breaks
there'll be no warning, take my word for it!</q></p>

<p><q>My dear Mrs Ross, you'll alarm my daughter if
you hold such gloomy views. You forget she's just
come from England, and hasn't yet overcome the
notion, which most new-comers have, that every
native carries a knife concealed somewhere about
him for the express purpose of murdering someone,
preferably a European.</q></p>

<p><q>I never had such a foolish idea as that, papa,</q>
protested Jean.</p>

<p><q>Your father's only jesting,</q> said Mrs Ross quietly.</p>

<p>Mrs Ross had risen while speaking, and was now
gazing out of the window into the Residency gardens.</p>

<pb n="51"/>
<p><q>Here's Dr Lennard,</q> said she suddenly, <q>I don't
know what we should do without him. He has never
omitted calling upon us twice a day to tell us the
latest news. Somebody is with him, I——</q></p>

<p>She stopped abruptly. Her lips went very white.</p>

<p>She turned hastily from the window.</p>

<p>Mr Atherton was standing where he could not see
Mrs Ross. He did not hear what she said. In fact,
he did not know she was near.</p>

<p><q>Who's the man walking with Lennard? It looks
uncommonly like Jack Hawke! But surely Captain
Hawke wouldn't show his face in Lucknow!</q></p>

<p>The man next Atherton nudged his arm.</p>

<p><q>Mrs Ross is close by,</q> he whispered.</p>

<p>Mr Atherton shrugged his shoulders and said
nothing. He remembered the scandal associated
with Captain Hawke and how nearly it touched Mrs
Ross, to whose sister, Agnes, Hawke had been
engaged.</p>

<p>Mrs Ross walked away with a gesture of anger it
was impossible to mistake. Jean heard her words.
Mrs Ross interested her immensely. The tall hand-
some woman—handsome in spite of her somewhat
sallow complexion—suggested romance.</p>

<p>The two men were now about thirty yards from
the Residency, and Jean looked with curiosity at
Lennard's companion. He was a handsome fellow
whose sunburnt face was burnt to almost the same
colour as his tawny hair and moustache. His figure
was erect and firmly set, despite the fact that he
walked with a slight limp. His uniform was torn and
dusty, his boots cracked, and altogether he looked
worn and travel-stained. Whatever was his character,
outwardly he was picturesque.</p>

<pb n="52"/>
<p>Shortly after he came in with the surgeon. His
reception was peculiar. He bowed to the ladies, but
they acknowledged his salutation so frigidly it could
scarcely be said to be an acknowledgment at all.
One or two men pointedly turned their backs, and
others pretended not to recognise him.</p>

<p><q>What did I tell you, Lennard?</q> he growled
savagely. <q>Why did you persuade me to come
here? I was a fool! I ought to have stayed in the
cantonments. All my chums there haven't given
me the cold shoulder. Isn't it deuced droll to find
that the men gladdest to see me should be the black-
skinned chaps—the fellows of my old regiment?</q></p>

<p><q>Not at all, Jack. They know the best side of
you.</q></p>

<p><q>And my own countrymen its worst. Let's get
out of this.</q></p>

<p>But the doctor was loth to go. He had seen
Jean, and the sight of her was to him like a spring
of sparkling water to a thirsty traveller. All the
pulses within him—an impassive, unemotional man
as he was—were stirred by this girl as they had
never been stirred before.</p>

<p><q>Wait a moment, Jack,</q> Lennard whispered,
<q>don't be in such a confounded hurry!</q></p>

<p>Jack Hawke scarcely heard him. His face was
as hard as flint, and his eyes, with a spark of sullen
fierceness in them, were fixed upon Mrs Ross, who,
after meeting his gaze for a couple of seconds, turned
away abruptly, and soon after left the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>.</p>

<p><q>Curse her!</q> Lennard heard him mutter. <q>But
for that woman I might be holding up my head with
the best.</q></p>

<p>The young doctor pressed his arm sympathisingly.</p>

<pb n="53"/>
<p><q>And so you can now,</q> said Lennard. <q>I've but
to tell the story of your doings for the past fortnight,
and there's not a man who won't be proud to shake
you by the hand, nor a woman who would refuse to
kiss you.</q></p>

<p><q>Bah! Don't talk of women. Mind, Ernest, not
a word of the horrible business at Delhi.</q></p>

<p><q>If you wish it, I'll hold my tongue; but it can't
be kept a secret long, and then you'll be a hero.
Atherton, you remember Captain Hawke?</q></p>

<p>Lennard had by this time led him to where Jean
was.</p>

<p><q>Yes, certainly,</q> said Atherton frankly, extending
his hand, and grasping Hawke's heartily.</p>

<p><q>Thank you, Mr Atherton, I've not forgotten
that you stuck up for me at a time when it was with
Jack Hawke a case of give a dog a bad name.</q></p>

<p><q>I know—I know. The past is all buried. This
isn't a time for certificates of good character. We
want men who can fight. No one can fight harder
than you, Captain Hawke.</q></p>

<p><q>By heaven, Atherton, you're right,</q> cried
Lennard, emphatically.</p>

<p>Then Lennard turned to Jean with a somewhat
embarrassed air. He shook hands with her, but
said not a word concerning his companion, although
it was obvious from Jean's expression she expected
he would do so. Lennard looked very embarrassed,
and cast a glance towards Mr Atherton, as if asking
him to come to his rescue, but the magistrate
remained quiescent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hawke stood cap in hand, and, now
that he was bare-headed, handsomer than ever,
despite the cloud on his brow, and his tightly com-
<pb n="54"/>
pressed lips. He gave Jean one swift glance and
then abruptly turned away, as if to relieve Lennard
of all embarrassment.</p>

<p><q>I was an ass to come here—I'm going back to
the cantonments,</q> he said in a low voice to the
surgeon, <q>but you stay. I won't take you from
your friends.</q></p>

<p><q>Wait one moment in the gardens,</q> said Lennard
hurriedly—<q>Atherton and I will join you there.
Will you excuse us, Miss Atherton?</q></p>

<p><q>How troubled he looks,</q> thought Jean, with a
little bow of acquiescence. <q>Can anything have
happened?</q></p>

<p>She watched her father and the doctor walk away
arm in arm. Jack Hawke had preceded them.</p>

<p><q>Miss Atherton,</q> said a voice behind her.</p>

<p>She turned and saw Mrs Ross. A singular change
had come over the woman. Her countenance
seemed convulsed with passion.</p>

<p><q>I hope Dr Lennard hasn't been so indiscreet as
to introduce that man to you?</q> she cried.</p>

<p><q>You mean Captain Hawke? No. But why
not? What is there against him?</q></p>

<p><q>Everything. He's a man no decent woman
ought to know. Some day—— But I won't trouble
you with an old scandal. I'm surprised Lennard
should have brought him here. Thank heaven no
harm's been done. His reception must have con-
vinced him his conduct's neither forgotten nor for-
given. I congratulate you, my dear, on your having
escaped making the acquaintance of Captain Hawke.</q></p>

<p>Before Jean could ask for an explanation Mrs
Ross was gone, leaving the girl both pained and
puzzled.</p>

<pb n="55"/>
<p><q>I dared not introduce Jack Hawke to Miss
Atherton,</q> said Lennard to the magistrate as they
walked across the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>. <q>Had I acted accord-
ing to my own opinion and judgment I should have
had no hesitation in so doing; but I left it for you
to do so if you thought fit.</q></p>

<p><q>You were right,</q> said the magistrate after a
pause. <q>I really believe Hawke is innocent, but
when a man acts as if he were guilty it wants some
courage to go in the face of public opinion. At all
events, at present I don't feel justified in recognising
him to the extent of making him a friend of Jean's.</q></p>

<p><q>It doesn't very much matter,</q> returned Lennard
a little coldly. <q>Before long we shall need all the
friends we can muster. We won't discuss Hawke
now, but rather the frightful tidings he has brought.
Atherton, it's horrible! Delhi's in the hands of the
rebels and they've been murdering right and left!</q></p>

<p><q>Great God! It can't be true—the miscreants!</q>
exclaimed Atherton.</p>

<p><q>It <emph>is</emph> true. Hawke escaped by a miracle, and
reached here he scarcely knows how. For two days
he carried a wounded comrade on his back. The
man is now in the cantonment barracks, and will
tell you much more of Hawke's pluck and endurance
than you'll get out of Hawke himself.</q></p>

<p>Jack Hawke was walking, or rather limping,
slowly in front, and the magistrate, greatly moved,
ran to him and placed his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p><q>Hawke,</q> he exclaimed, <q>tell me about—about
this horrible catastrophe. Is it so bad?</q></p>

<p><q>It's as bad as it can be,</q> answered Hawke,
tugging savagely at his moustache. <q>Todd, of the
Telegraph-office, Fraser, the Commissioner, Mr
<pb n="56"/>
Jennings and his daughter and Miss Clifford,
Colonel Ripley, Captain Burrowes—— My God! I
can't go on with the list; it's too awful!</q></p>

<p><q>My dear fellow, what do you mean?</q> cried Mr
Atherton.</p>

<p><q>What do I mean, man? I mean that they're
all dead—murdered, butchered—and scores more!
I shall never forget the sight—never! Imagine
seeing your comrades, men whom you had laughed
and joked with in the morning, lying in the afternoon
dead, side by side, some almost unrecognisable.
What the man in command at Meerut can be about
I can't conceive. Meerut's only a thirty-six miles'
ride from Delhi, yet no one seems to have thought
of sending on the news of the bad business there.
The arrival of the mutinous sepoys, fresh from the
murder of Colonel Finnis and the massacre of others
—men and women—was the first intimation we had
at Delhi that anything was wrong. Even then the
devils might have been pursued. There were plenty
of troops at Meerut to do it, but no one to give
them orders.</q></p>

<p><q>But General Hewitt——</q></p>

<p><q>General Hewitt simply sat still. Don't talk of
it. It's cruel—cruel. The most ghastly thing in
English history, and to think that it might have
been prevented—my God!</q></p>

<p><q>Still there were European troops in Delhi.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh yes, there were troops—a mere handful; but
what could we do with a city seven miles in cir-
cumference to defend, with enemies without and
mutiny within?</q></p>

<p><q>But you did something?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, we did something. Willoughby and his
<pb n="57"/>
eight men blew up the magazine, and sent a thousand
or so of the devils to perdition. Scully, the plucky
fellow who fired the train, perished in the explosion,
and so did Sergeant Edwards. I wish I'd gone with
them. No such luck. Lennard, old chap, I'm off to
the cantonments. I shall see you later on. Good-
bye, Mr Atherton.</q></p>

<p>He strode away with the fierce hunger for revenge
shining in his eyes.</p>

<p><q>He hasn't said a word about himself,</q> cried
Lennard. <q>That's just like Jack Hawke. I'll tell
you what his comrade said. At the last moment his
regiment, the 38th, turned against their officers. A
few surrounded Major Abbott, who was very popular,
and forced him out, shutting the main guard gate so
that he shouldn't return and be killed. Hawke was
among the officers left behind. He was about to
make a jump from the ramparts into the ditch when
he heard the scream of women. He and another
man rushed back, rescued two ladies, and making a
rope with their handkerchiefs, lowered them safely
into the ditch. They made their way to the river
and lay in hiding. Hawke was the only one of the
party who could swim, and he got his friend and the
two women across safely. Then after terrible priva-
tions, to say nothing of being attacked by three
troopers—two of whom Hawke killed single-handed
—his friend was wounded and almost <foreign xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</foreign>
—they reached a village where the natives were
friendly, and here the women were left—indeed, they
couldn't travel any farther—and Hawke and his
friend came on to Lucknow to bring the news.</q></p>

<p><q>How brave of him!</q></p>

<p>Lennard started. Unperceived, Jean had joined
<pb n="58"/>
them. She was too anxious to remain any longer
in the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>.</p>

<p><q>Go back—go back, Jean,</q> said her father im-
patiently, almost harshly. <q>Don't you know the
danger of sunstroke?</q></p>

<p>The girl looked wistfully from her father to
Lennard as if seeking an explanation from the latter;
the doctor was impassive.</p>

<p><q>I must insist, my dear,</q> reiterated the magistrate.</p>

<p>Jean did not contest the point, but slowly turned
to the Residency with a disappointed look on her
face.</p>

<p><q>The women had better not know of this fresh
disaster,</q> said Atherton. <q>It will only increase their
apprehensions, though I still maintain there's nothing
to fear in Lucknow.</q></p>

<p><q>I hope so,</q> said Lennard curtly. <q>At all events,
we may know more before to-night. I'm going now
to see what gossip I can pick up. You know I've
many friends among the bazaar people.</q></p>

<p>They parted, the magistrate returning to the
Residency, and the doctor passing into the city.</p>

<div n="4" type="chapter">
<pb n="59"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="4">IV</num></head>
<head type="main">At Gun Fire</head>

<p>The following day was Sunday, the 30th May—a
day ever to be remembered in the history of Luck-
now. Everything went on with its usual routine. A
religious service was held which all the European
troops in the cantonments attended. Sir Henry
Lawrence, as was his custom on Sunday evening,
invited his staff to dine with him at the Residency
bungalow.</p>

<p>It was the quarter of an hour before dinner. Sir
Henry Lawrence was surrounded by a group of
officers who were talking eagerly on the position of
affairs. Sir Henry took very little part in the con-
versation, he preferred to listen.</p>

<p>Lennard, who had been invited, was that evening
more than usually impressed by the man upon whom
so much depended. The sight of his attenuated but
soldier-like form, the eyes already sunken with
sleeplessness, the forehead furrowed with anxious
thought, the soft hair cut short on the head, the long
wavy beard descending to his breast, presented a
noble and pathetic picture. Of all the men who
came to the front, in that terrible time, not one was
so beloved as Sir Henry Lawrence.</p>

<p><q>Is it true?</q> exclaimed a young lieutenant, <q>that
that unlucky beggar Jack Hawke has been seen in
Lucknow?</q></p>

<pb n="60"/>
<p><q>Quite true,</q> replied the adjutant of the 71st. <q>I
met him looking as if he had just come back from a
tiger-hunt, and had had a severe mauling. I could
get nothing out of him. He was inquiring for you,
Sir Henry. Did he succeed in finding you?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> was the answer. <q>I saw him.</q></p>

<p>Lennard watched the commissioner narrowly.
Hawke must have made him acquainted with the
horrible details of the Delhi murders, but by not the
movement of a muscle did the staunch old man
betray the possession of his knowledge. It was clear
that besides Hawke and his comrade there were only
three Europeans in Lucknow who at that moment
knew of the Delhi tragedies. Those were Sir Henry
Lawrence, Atherton and Lennard himself.</p>

<p>The conversation suddenly turned upon Hawke.
He was freely discussed, the majority lamenting that
so promising a young fellow should have gone to the
bad. Drink, betting, gambling, dissipation of various
kinds—Jack Hawke had indulged in all the social
vices.</p>

<p>A good many of the men had been Hawke's chums;
and so engrossing was the topic that it was con-
tinued after the dinner was commenced.</p>

<p><q>It's the old story,</q> said the adjutant. <q>A woman
was at the bottom of his misfortunes. He was madly
in love with Agnes D'Arcy, and they were engaged.
Then she jilted him, and he went to the devil as fast
as he could.</q></p>

<p><q>Didn't he pay a great deal of attention to that
pretty widow, Mrs Sandilands, at the time he was
engaged to Miss D'Arcy?</q> asked Major Walters of
the 13th Native Infantry.</p>

<p><q>What of that?</q> exclaimed the adjutant. <q>Mrs
<pb n="61"/>
Sandilands was an awful flirt, and all the fellows went
mad over her.</q></p>

<p><q>But,</q> said Colonel Lambert, <q>nothing excuses his
dishonourable and shameful act afterwards. I mean
the writing of the anonymous letters to George
Holcombe, who married Agnes D'Arcy.</q></p>

<p><q>That was never proved against him, and he denied
it,</q> said the adjutant.</p>

<p><q>Well, the handwriting was exactly like his. His
own orderly swore he posted the letters for his
master, and when Holcombe challenged Hawke, he
refused to fight.</q></p>

<p><q>That wasn't because he was afraid of losing
Jack Hawke's one of the best swordsmen in the
service, and a crack shot besides,</q> put in Lieutenant
Savage of the 71st.</p>

<p><q>Hang it all,</q> said the pompous colonel, <q>he was
glad enough to exchange into another regiment and
get out of Lucknow. That doesn't look like innocence.
I hope I sha'n't have to meet him: I shall feel bound
to give him a piece of my mind.</q></p>

<p><q>How generous,</q> whispered a pert young ensign
to his neighbour, <q>considering how little he has to
give.</q></p>

<p>Sir Henry Lawrence was apparently either in-
different to this talk or he did not hear it. He was
engaged in an earnest conversation with Lennard.</p>

<p>Colonel Lambert had just expressed his determina-
tion of acting the part of the censor when the door
opened, and in walked the very man about whom
they had been talking—Jack Hawke.</p>

<p>The wagging of tongues instantly ceased. Half
of the diners looked at Hawke, the other half at Sir
Henry Lawrence.</p>

<pb n="62"/>
<p>The latter rose and, beckoning to the new-comer,
said:</p>

<p><q>Captain Hawke, will you come to this end of the
table? I've had a seat reserved for you.</q></p>

<p><q>A slap in the face for Lambert,</q> muttered the
ensign. <q>What will he do now?</q></p>

<p>The colonel did what was wisest under the cir-
cumstances—he held his tongue.</p>

<p>Hawke three hours before had reported himself to
Sir Henry, and the latter had sent him to make
cautious inquiries as to the state of affairs. A better
man than Jack Hawke could not have been selected
for the duty.</p>

<p>Before he had been transferred to the 38th Native
Infantry he was a captain in the 71st, stationed at
Lucknow and idolised by his men.</p>

<p>But this was some time since. The 71st were now
regarded by Sir Henry Lawrence with considerable
suspicion. And, indeed, but a few days before
Hawke's arrival, a number of the sepoys belonging
to the regiment had been removed from the Mutchee-
bhawun on account of their suspected disaffection,
and were stationed in the city.</p>

<p><q>Well, have you found out anything, Hawke?</q>
said Sir Henry in a low voice when Jack was
seated.</p>

<p><q>Yes. A man of my old company told me that at
gun fire the signal to mutiny would be given.</q></p>

<p>Sir Henry heard this disquieting piece of news
with perfect equanimity.</p>

<p><q>And what did you answer?</q> he asked.</p>

<p><q>I laughed; but all the same, made inquiries else-
where to see if I could find any confirmation, but I
could learn nothing. Anyhow, the fellow was so
<pb n="63"/>
positive, I'm afraid there's something in it. Have
you any commands for me, Sir Henry?</q></p>

<p><q>Only that you should make a good dinner. You
have a good deal of leeway to make up in that
direction,</q> said Sir Henry, with a kindly smile.</p>

<p>Hawke made no reply, but fell to, heedless of the
astonished glances which were directed towards him
from all sides.</p>

<p>Gun fire was at nine o'clock, and swiftly the
minutes went by, then in the midst of the talk came
the sullen boom of a single cannon.</p>

<p>Sir Henry leaned forward, and said almost jest-
ingly to Hawke:</p>

<p><q>Your friends are not punctual.</q></p>

<p>Scarcely were the words out of his mouth when
the rattle of musketry shook the bungalow.</p>

<p>The Mutiny in Lucknow had begun.</p>

<p>At the sound of that volley, the ominous meaning
of which all knew, Sir Henry Lawrence sprang to
his feet, as did the officers.</p>

<p><q>Gentlemen,</q> he cried, <q>if we have coolness and
courage, it is now the time to show both. Each one
knows his duty. To the lines.</q></p>

<p>Not an instant was to be lost. Already a young
lieutenant had rushed to the stables to hurry round
the horses.</p>

<p>Lennard turned and looked at Jack Hawke.
Hawke's face was that of a man who had nerved
himself to do some terrible deed.</p>

<p><q>Lennard,</q> he muttered hoarsely, <q>I've been
through the horrors of Delhi. I know what these
devils will do if they once lose their heads. I've got
a long score to wipe out in blood before I shall be
satisfied. If they'd only stayed their hand when
<pb n="64"/>
they came to the women! But they didn't—and the
poor little youngsters too. What about the Residency
—is it safe?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I feel sure it is—at least, for the present.
Sir Henry has taken care of that.</q></p>

<p><q>He's a brick. There's one woman there whom I
hate, but I suppose I should save her life, even though
she mightn't thank me. There's another—well, I
know little about her; but I think she'd be worth
dying for—the girl that neither you nor her father
would introduce me to, and you were quite right.
Everybody knows I'm a blackguard, but blackguards
can sometimes fight. I wonder if Sir Henry has a
spare mount for me? If not, I can walk.</q></p>

<p>Hawke spoke in jerks. His manner almost sug-
gested he was talking to himself rather than to
Lennard. Meanwhile the two were crowding out
with the staff to the verandah, where Sir Henry was
awaiting his horse.</p>

<p>The moon was shining brilliantly, and everything
—bushes, trees and buildings—stood out with micro-
scopic sharpness. The volley of musketry had been
succeeded by a few dropping shots, but now there
was a pause of silence, the significance of which no
one could fathom.</p>

<p>Suddenly fierce shouts of exultation were heard in
the distance, and the next moment a tongue of flame
shot into the air, followed by another and another.
It was the firing of the mess-house bungalow, and
the dry wood crackled and blazed with fury.</p>

<p>Sir Henry and his staff were standing in the full
glare of the fierce ruddy light, and all their faces were
recognisable. At that very moment the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">soubadhar</foreign>
of the sepoy guard on duty for the night at the
<pb n="65"/>
Residency bungalow brought up his men, and halted
them facing the group of officers under the verandah.</p>

<p>This, of course, was only in the ordinary course of
things, but to-night in the light of that blazing
bungalow, which was signalling to the million in-
habitants of the city that rebellion had broken out,
who could say what it might mean?</p>

<p>Going up to Captain Wilson and saluting him, the
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">soubadhar</foreign> said:</p>

<p><q>Shall I order the guard to load with ball?</q></p>

<p>Captain Wilson would not take upon himself to
decide such a point at so critical a period.</p>

<p><q>Are the men to load with ball, Sir Henry?</q> said
he, turning to the commissioner.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Lawrence answered without a moment's
hesitation:</p>

<p><q>Yes, let them load.</q></p>

<p><q>My God,</q> said Hawke in a low voice, <q>that's
plucky. He trusts them. Well, perhaps it's the
right thing.</q></p>

<p>The loading then began, Sir Henry and the officers
standing motionless as statues in the glare of the
fire. The thud of ramming down the cartridges was
distinctly heard, and sounded like a menace. Then
the sepoys brought their muskets to the capping
position. The caps were adjusted. What was to
happen next?</p>

<p>All waited in anxious suspense.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Lawrence and other responsible mili-
tary chiefs of the British force were at the mercy of
these men. One bolder than the rest, with the spirit
of rebellion at his heart, could at that moment have
decided the fate of the city, and the fate of those
who from the upper windows of the Residency were
<pb n="66"/>
anxiously watching the red angry glare to the north-
ward, and tremblingly listening for a renewal of the
firing.</p>

<p>There was not one of these calm European men
standing within the portico of the Residency who
did not feel that their lives hung upon the merest
chance. But not an action, not a gesture, not
a word betrayed what was in their minds.</p>

<p>The capping was finished, the last movement
would decide the point. The word of command
rang out sharply. The guard shouldered their
rifles. They marched to their posts. The crisis
was past.</p>

<p>The next moment the horses arrived, and Sir
Henry swung himself into the saddle. Then, fol-
lowed by his staff, he started for the lines.</p>

<p>At first it was thought that the ringleaders of the
outbreak were the disaffected men of the 71st Native
Infantry, who, as already mentioned, had been re-
moved from the Mutcheebhawun to the city. This
proved to be not so. The real instigators were the
men of another company of the same regiment in
the cantonments. These turned out and commenced
firing, while a body of about forty made straight for
the mess-house, ransacked it and set it on fire. The
officers were everywhere on the alert. Hearing the
volley they at once left their messes, and rushed to
the lines to try and reason with the men. All this
happened simultaneously with the departure of Sir
Henry Lawrence and his staff from the Residency
bungalow.</p>

<p>Lennard and Hawke were left standing beneath
the verandah. They watched the officers gallop
away, and not until the party had skirted a line of
<pb n="67"/>
buildings on the left, and were lost to sight, did the
two men speak.</p>

<p><q>We're in for it now, Lennard,</q> said Hawke, draw-
ing a deep breath. <q>I'm off to the stables. If I can
find a horse I won't be left out in the cold when
fighting's to be done.</q></p>

<p>Without waiting for Lennard's reply, Jack Hawke
strode away.</p>

<p>The young doctor stood vaguely watching the
flickering flames. Hawke's reference to Jean
Atherton as a girl worth dying for was still in his
memory.</p>

<p><q>Worth dying for?</q> he muttered. <q>Yes—a
thousand times yes. But better worth living for.
If Jack Hawke should fall in love with her, and she
with him, what chance have I? Jack pretends to
despise women. That's all moonshine. And she—
well, women don't altogether dislike a handsome
reprobate. She said <q>How brave of him.</q> And
it was my praise of Jack which caused her to utter
the words.</q></p>

<p>He spoke aloud with a bitterness in his voice he
could not repress.</p>

<p><q>Bah,</q> he continued, almost fiercely, <q>what does
it matter? Maybe all that either Hawke or I can
do will be to die for her.</q></p>

<p>A rapid step on the verandah caused him to turn.
It was Hawke.</p>

<p><q>All the horses are gone,</q> cried the latter.</p>

<p><q>What are you going to do?</q> asked the doctor.</p>

<p><q>How can I tell? I can't stop here anyway.
Perhaps my old company of the 71st may listen to
me. They would once, I'll swear. It would be
funny if the man who was almost drummed out of
<pb n="68"/>
Lucknow turned out to be of use, wouldn't it?
What will you do—stay here?</q></p>

<p><q>No,</q> said Lennard slowly. <q>I shall try and get
to the Residency. The women will be anxious to
know what's going on. I may be able to ascertain
something on the way.</q></p>

<p><q>The Residency,</q> exclaimed Hawke, twisting his
moustache. <q>Yes, you're right. Lennard,</q> he
added after a pause, <q>each of us carries his life in
his hands. If you should never see me again, say
a good word for me to that brown-eyed little girl.
She will probably hear a few lies from Mrs Ross
about Jack Hawke, and I should like her to know
the truth.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you mean Jean Atherton?</q> said Lennard
huskily.</p>

<p><q>Yes. I can't explain why, Lennard; but I swear
to you that when I looked into the soft eyes of that
girl I felt as though I had been seeking her all my
life, and had at last found her.</q></p>

<p>Lennard made no reply. He understood Hawke
perfectly. He had had the same feeling himself.</p>

<p>At that moment the sharp rattle of musketry fire
awoke the echoes.</p>

<p><q>Musical, isn't it?</q> cried Hawke. <q>What busi-
ness have I to be standing here talking like a love-
sick fool when there's work to be done? Good-bye
old chap.</q></p>

<p>And turning abruptly, he rushed into the night.</p>

<p>The cantonments were northward of the city and
to get to the latter Lennard would have to cross the
bridge over the River Gumti. The Residency lay
a little to the left of the bridge.</p>

<p>Cautiously he proceeded. It was a night of doubt,
<pb n="69"/>
distrust, chaos. No one knew exactly the extent
of the disaffection. The majority of the 71st were
not to be relied upon, but a faithful few had not
wavered in their allegiance.</p>

<p>But there were the 48th, the 13th, the 7th Light
cavalry at Mudkheepore, about three miles away
from the cantonments, to be reckoned with also.
All the force that Sir Henry Lawrence had was
a portion of one solitary regiment of British soldiers
—the 32nd. The Europeans, military and civil,
amounted to about 900, of whom only 300 were
soldiers, and this handful might have to engage in
a hand-to-hand struggle with over 4000 troops, fully
equipped and trained to arms by European officers.</p>

<p>When Sir Henry Lawrence rode from the
Residency bungalow that night to quell, if possible,
the rising storm, he knew full well the formidable
task which lay before him. On the very afternoon
of the 30th, some six hours before the volley of
musketry gave the signal for the sepoys to rise, he
wrote to Mr Raikes, judge at Agra.</p>

<p><q>If the Commander-in-Chief delay much longer,
he may have to recover Cawnpore, Lucknow,
Allahabad—indeed, all down to Calcutta. While
we are entrenching two posts in the city—<foreign xml:lang="la">i.e.</foreign> the
Residency and the Mutcheebhawun—we are virtually
besieging four regiments (in a quiet way) with 300
Europeans. Not a very pleasant diversion from my
civil duties. I am daily in the town four miles off
for some hours; but I reside in the cantonments,
guarded by the gentlemen we are besieging.</q></p>

<p>Lennard knew the terrible situation quite as well
as if he had read the Commissioner's letter. And
as he cast his eyes round, and saw a circle of fire
<pb n="70"/>
gradually gathering, he shuddered. He knew that
Lucknow had been drawn into the vortex of
rebellion. On all sides the officers' bungalows were
being fired. A hailstorm of musketry shots, now
near, now far away, seemed to be descending. The
fierce shouts mingled together sounded like the roar
of an angry sea.</p>

<p>Yet he almost reached the lines of the 71st without
meeting a soul. It was only when he was within
five hundred yards or so of the native barracks that
he heard the sound of a horse's hoofs and the jingling
of arms and accoutrements.</p>

<p>Were they friends or foes?</p>

<p>The next half minute decided the question. That
solid tramp, tramp could not belong to the sepoys.
It was the march of the British soldiers. The
commander now came in sight. Lennard at once
recognised him. It was Brigadier Handscomb, as
fine an old soldier as ever put on uniform. A com-
pany of the 32nd followed him, and they came on
at the double.</p>

<p>At the same moment appeared a mass of dusky
heads and white uniforms from the lines of the 71st.
An angry yell burst from them, but they did not
advance. They had a wholesome dread of the
Europeans, even though they outnumbered the little
force by ten to one.</p>

<p><q>Fix bayonets!</q></p>

<p>The words rang out in the still air with a sharp
metallic sound. Lennard could see that the men of
the 32nd could hardly restrain their impatience.</p>

<p><q>Gently, my lads,</q> cried the old brigadier, half
turning round in his saddle. <q>Not a man must stir
till the order is given. You might kill friends.</q></p>

<pb n="71"/>
<p>The soldiers stood firm, and the brigadier rode
ahead to address the mutineers. He had scarcely
ridden twenty yards before a flash ran along the line
of the sepoys with the rapidity of a fuse.</p>

<p>A hundred muskets were emptied, and the old
commander was seen to fall from his horse. He
was shot dead, riddled by a score of bullets.</p>

<p><q>Charge, my lads,</q> shouted the officer second in
command, almost beside himself with grief and rage.
<q>No quarter to the murderous devils. What! you,
Lennard? For heaven's sake see to the Brigadier,
though I fear it's all up with him.</q></p>

<p>Waving his sword, the young officer bounded away
after his men. They needed no leading. They were
mad to avenge the death of their chief.</p>

<p><q>Dead—dead,</q> muttered Lennard, as he bent over
the corpse of the old man. <q>The first victim in
Lucknow. How many more will follow?</q></p>

<p>The doctor dragged the body of the brigadier to
a place of safety for burial on the morrow—he could
do no more—and hastened onwards.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the little band of the 32nd, with a yell
of fury, dashed forward. The sepoys turned tail,
and made haste to join their comrades, who had
concentrated themselves to the extreme right of the
lines. From here they intended to march to the
city, but Sir Henry Lawrence had been one too
many for them.</p>

<p>He saw from the first the importance of preventing,
as far as possible, communication between the
mutineers outside and the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmashery</foreign>—that is, the
bad and turbulent, the very scum of Lucknow. On
leaving the Residency bungalow, Sir Henry took
with him two guns and a company of the 32nd to
<pb n="72"/>
occupy the road leading from the cantonments to
the bridge.</p>

<p>Towards this point the 71st, mad with the taste
of blood, rushed and opened a hot musketry fire.
They were received with a deadly discharge of
grape. Desisting at once from the attack, they
returned to their lines, passing the infantry picket,
composed of natives and commanded by Lieutenant
Grant.</p>

<p>When the picket saw their comrades hurrying by
in a kind of delirium, shouting, yelling, firing their
muskets at random, they were seized with the in-
fection of excitement.</p>

<p>The <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">soubadhar</foreign> was one of the few who kept his
head cool.</p>

<p><q xml:lang="hi">Hoozur—hoozur,</q> he cried to Lieutenant Grant.
<q>Come with me. They mean to kill you.</q></p>

<p><q>Let them,</q> cried Grant firmly. <q>I shall stay
where I am.</q></p>

<p><q>No—no. What can you do among so many?
Come to my quarters,</q> pleaded the man.</p>

<p>The sepoys in the darkness had not seen Grant.
But it was scarcely possible he could escape without
attracting notice. He trusted the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">soubadhar</foreign>, and
followed him into the bungalow. Scarcely was he
in one of the rooms before the mutineers were heard
in the verandah.</p>

<p><q>Under the charpoy</q> (native four-legged bedstead),
whispered the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">soubadhar</foreign>.</p>

<p>The infuriated mob rushed in.</p>

<p><q>You are too late, brothers,</q> cried the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">soubadhar</foreign>.
<q>the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">hoozur</foreign> has escaped.</q></p>

<p><q>Nur Singh lies,</q> cried the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">havildar</foreign> of the picket.
<q>The <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">hoozur</foreign> is there.</q></p>

<pb n="73"/>
<p>The wretch pointed to the charpoy.</p>

<p>With a yell of brutal triumph, a score of men
rushed at the bedstead. In a second it was over-
turned. Bayonet and sword finished the bloodthirsty
work.</p>

<p>In the middle of the butchery came a pistol shot
fired through the open window of the bungalow.
The <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">havildar</foreign>, red with the blood of his victim, with
a malignant grin on his fiendish countenance, dropped
like a stone, shot through the head.</p>

<p>In a moment the sepoys stayed their hacking and
slashing, though this mattered little to the murdered
officer, and looked with scared faces at each other.
The death of the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">havildar</foreign> seemed like the punishment
of Heaven. Then, recovering themselves, they rushed
out of the bungalow. But those outside could tell
them nothing. They had heard the shot, but that
was all.</p>

<p>While the sepoys were running hither and thither,
thrusting their bayonets into the thickets and yelling
like very maniacs, Jack Hawke was creeping through
the long grass at the back of the bungalow. It was
he who had shot the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">havildar</foreign>.</p>

<p><q>You devils,</q> he muttered half aloud. <q>My own
men too. I know them every one. I would have
showed myself, but to what end? It was too late.
They'd got the blood fever on them. They were
seeing red.</q></p>

<p>This was quite true. Jack knew the native tempera-
ment thoroughly.</p>

<p><q>Anyhow, there's one rascal less in the world,</q> he
continued with a grim smile. <q>That dastardly
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">havildar</foreign> will murder no more.</q></p>

<p>He crept rapidly, like one who was well acquainted
<pb n="74"/>
with the ground, and knew the point he was aiming
for. A very few minutes brought him to the road.</p>

<p>The moonlight showed about fifty men coming
towards him, and Hawke shrank back into the grass
till he had made out who they were. He soon
determined, from their carriage and long, easy strides,
they were Sikhs.</p>

<p>He waited till they were within a dozen yards or
so, and then emerged from his concealment. He
saw they were commanded by a European officer.</p>

<p><q>Who goes there?</q> called out the latter.</p>

<p><q>No stranger to you, Loughnan. I'm Jack Hawke.</q></p>

<p><q>What, dear old Jack? It can't be. Hawke's in
Delhi.</q></p>

<p><q>He was, old chap. Never mind explanations
now; what's the game?</q></p>

<p><q>The rascally traitors of the 71st have secured the
treasure and the colours; but they won't have them
long.</q></p>

<p><q>Not if John Loughnan's on their <choice><corr>track</corr><orig>tract</orig></choice>. I'm with
you. Have you a spare sword?</q></p>

<p>Loughnan turned round quickly, and taking a
tulwar from one of the men, handed it to Hawke.</p>

<p><q>It won't be the first time you've made a stroke
with a tulwar,</q> said he.</p>

<p><q>Nor the last, I hope,</q> returned Hawke.</p>

<p>They wasted no time. While they were talking
they were hurrying on to the cantonments, which now
seemed one mass of flame. The officers' bungalows
had been fired in every direction—indeed, as was
discovered the next day, only the Residency bungalow
and one or two more escaped.</p>

<p><q>The crash has come at last, Hawke,</q> said Lieu-
tenant Loughnan. <q>We've been expecting it for the
<pb n="75"/>
last three weeks. I'm not sorry; we've had a dog's
life.</q></p>

<p><q>How?</q></p>

<p><q>You know the regulation ordering all the officers
to sleep in the native lines. The object was, of
course, to prevent or check conspiracy, and show
confidence in the sepoys.</q></p>

<p><q>Confidence in the tiger,</q> broke in Hawke
abruptly.</p>

<p><q>Exactly—much about the same thing. The
regulation was a stupid farce. As if the men couldn't
conspire and plot and intrigue just as well when we
were present as when we were absent. All it did was
to keep us in a state of constant worry. You know
Farquhar of the 7th Cavalry?</q></p>

<p><q>I remember him.</q></p>

<p><q>He wrote home the other day, and he showed me
the letter; and by heaven, every word he says is
true. I only hope some newspaper in England will
get hold of his letter and print it. He tells how all
the officers of each regiment have had to sleep
together armed to the teeth, and two or three of each
regiment had to remain awake, taking two hours at
a time, to watch over our men. That's what we've
had to do for the last month; and by Jove, we kept
the watches strictly, you bet, when our throats
depended on it. I've slept in my clothes every night
for a fortnight, and I'm jolly well sick of it.</q></p>

<p><q>I know,</q> growled Hawke. <q>And yet, I suppose,
some red tape, doddering fool at Calcutta, squatting
in his armchair, will want to know why you didn't
disarm the native regiments.</q></p>

<p><q>Disarm? How the devil could we? If we'd
a couple of European regiments and a few more guns
<pb n="76"/>
we might have tried the game; but as we were—
rot!</q></p>

<p>They talked on in a low voice, for they did not
want the Sikhs to hear—not that there was much
danger of their being understood even if their
words reached the ears of the men. Still, it was
best to be on the safe side.</p>

<p><q>For two pins,</q> said Loughnan, giving a half glance
round, <q>my men would cut and join in the general
scramble for plunder. The Sikhs are born looters.
I've had to promise them handsome presents if we
succeed in saving the treasure-chest.</q></p>

<p>They had now entered the main street of the
cantonments. On each side bungalows were burn-
ing. The contents which were at all portable were
scattered on the ground. They would not remain
there long. The camp followers, the villagers and
the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign>, with which Lucknow swarmed would
soon be on the scene of the plunder. A few sepoys
were about, but they were too busy making off
with booty to trouble about Loughnan and his
Sikhs.</p>

<p><q>This way, Jack. The bungalow containing the
treasure is on the right. By Jove, we're in time,</q>
Loughnan muttered.</p>

<p>It had not been set on fire, but was filled with armed
men, who were shouting and quarrelling over the
division of the spoil.</p>

<p>Loughnan posted twenty of his men within the
verandah, so as to command the windows. The rest
he led softly within the doorway. Jack Hawke was
by his side. Loughnan's idea was to discharge a
volley of musketry within the room. This he
expected would drive the sepoys to the windows.</p>

<pb n="77"/>
<p><q>Half-a-dozen of you kneel,</q> he whispered, <q>the
rest fire over the others' heads. Now.</q></p>

<p>The interior consisted of a suite of three rooms.
Probably there were at least a hundred men scattered
about. At the discharge of the muskets they gave
a hideous yell. Some, unarmed, sought the windows,
others rushed to seize their muskets, which they had
laid down so as to seize the spoil the readier.</p>

<p>The next moment Loughnan and Hawke, followed
by their men, dashed in. A fierce hand-to-hand
combat ensued. The sepoys had no stomach for
fighting. Most of them, seizing what coin they could,
fled. The treasure-chest containing the money for
the payment of the troops had been forced open, and
was lying in the middle of the centre room. Not far
off was the dead body of a young English officer.
He had given up his life rather than desert his
post.</p>

<p><q>Poor Fitzgerald!</q> muttered Loughnan, stopping
a moment. <q>He was engaged to be married to a girl
in Calcutta. It'll break her heart.</q></p>

<p>The two stooped to restore the rupees to their
receptacle. The Sikhs were quite equal to the task
of driving out the sepoys, and were doing their work
well.</p>

<p>Hawke listened for the firing outside. Loughnan
had given orders that as the sepoys came rushing out
of the windows, the Sikhs he had stationed in the
verandah should open fire. But not a shot had been
heard.</p>

<p><q>Something's wrong!</q> suddenly exclaimed Hawke.</p>

<p>He rushed to the nearest window, pushing the
soldiers right and left. The Sikhs outside had left
their posts. Apparently they were fraternising with
<pb n="78"/>
the sepoys. The glare of the burning bungalows on
all sides made everything as clear as though it were
day. He could see them a few yards away talking
with the mutinous men of the 71st.</p>

<p>This was bad enough, but what he saw beyond was
worse. Some two or three hundred men, attracted
by the firing, were coming to the assistance of their
comrades. If the Sikhs proved traitors, he and
Loughnan would be caught like rats in a trap.</p>

<p>Not a moment was to be lost. Leaping out of the
window, Hawke rushed to the Sikhs. Boldly thrust-
ing himself in their midst, he asked them why they
held parley with traitorous Hindoo dogs.</p>

<p><q>Are we not your friends? Have you not eaten
our bread? You, Ras Singh, are you, too, false to
your oath?</q></p>

<p>Ras Singh was the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">soubadhar</foreign>, and Hawke re-
membered him well, though he had not seen the man
for some two years. But he had once done the Sikh
a service, and now was the time to ask for a requital.</p>

<p>Ras Singh's answer was significant.</p>

<p><q>We like our lieutenant and you, too, <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">Hoozur</foreign>, and
we will not allow you to be harmed; but if the whole
army turns, we must turn too.</q></p>

<p>There was meaning in this. No doubt it explained
the rising of many regiments who felt themselves
bound to obey the mysterious and powerful authority
of the <q xml:lang="hi">Fouj ki Bheera</q> or general will of the army.
Hawke was far too masterful to permit the argument
to override him.</p>

<p><q>But the whole army hasn't turned. <emph>You</emph> have
not turned. I've just come from Delhi, and I tell
you the Sikhs there are faithful.</q></p>

<p>Ras Singh might have proved obdurate, but one
<pb n="79"/>
of the sepoys hastened matters. He raised his
musket, and pointed it at Hawke. He was in the
act of cocking it when Jack sprang forward, swift as
a greyhound. With one sweep of the tulwar, its
short bent blade, keen as a razor, he buried it deep
in the man's neck. The sepoy dropped like a stone.</p>

<p>It was enough. The Sikh to whom the tulwar
belonged was among those who were wavering.
His blade had shed Hindoo blood. Heaven had
ordained this. Therefore it was meant that he
should be faithful to his salt.</p>

<p><q>Come, brothers!</q> he shouted. <q>We were wrong.
Let us follow the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">Hoozur</foreign>.</q></p>

<p><q>Bless you for those words!</q> growled Hawke
in his own vernacular, <q>you know which side your
bread's buttered.</q></p>

<p>Then he shouted the order to close up. The
sepoys heard the order and bolted. One volley
from the Sikhs sufficed to disperse the advancing
force. The critical moment was passed. Hawke
returned in triumph to the bungalow, to find
Loughnan on the point of coming to his assistance.</p>

<p><q>Saved, old chap, and by the skin of our teeth!</q>
cried Hawke. <q>On with the treasure!</q></p>

<p>The coin chest, secured to a couple of poles, was
carried by four study Sikhs towards the spot where
Sir Henry had concentrated his little force of
European soldiers.</p>

<head type="main">A Lull in the Storm</head>

<p>As dawn approached, Sir Henry gradually
grasped the extent of the danger by which he was
surrounded. On only one point was he unsatisfied.
No information had come in concerning the 7th
Cavalry. The lines of this regiment were at Mud-
kheepore, about three miles from the cantonments.
It was a hazardous task for a messenger to get
through the latter, with the bungalows blazing and
lawless marauders in possession of the ground.
Some of the 7th had accompanied the 32nd, being
in the cantonments at the time of the outbreak.
Of these Sir Henry felt pretty certain.</p>

<p>At the first streak of morning light, a party of
horsemen were seen by the picket on guard in the
direction of the Mudkheepore road. They proved
to be a detachment of the 7th—all who had remained
faithful out of those stationed in the lines. The men
had been called out immediately the red glare in
the sky told what was happening in the canton-
ments; but before the line could be formed some
forty of them dashed off at full speed towards the
cantonments, the rest patrolled during the night
and at length found their way to headquarters.</p>

<p>Sir Henry was much relieved in his mind when
he saw them; and after day had fairly broken he
resolved to take the field. The 7th Cavalry were
<pb n="81"/>
directed to move towards Mudkheepore, where the
officers' houses and the troopers' lines had been
seized and fired by the mutineers, who had gone
up from the cantonments in great numbers, hoping
to win over the cavalry. Two companies of the 32nd
were ordered to support the cavalry, the rest being
left behind to guard the approaches to the city.</p>

<p>Just as the force, with Sir Henry Lawrence in
person leading, were about to advance, Mr Martin
Gubbins, the commissioner of Oudh, rode in from
Lucknow. He reported the city to be violently
agitated, but that no outbreak had taken place.</p>

<p><q>Nothing could be better than your arrangements,
Sir Henry,</q> said he. <q>I left some 6000 of the
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign> howling and yelling, and ripe for any
villainy, the other side of the Gumti. They dared
not cross the bridge in face of your troops. But
for that they would by this time have joined the
mutineers.</q></p>

<p><q>And the Residency—the women and children?</q>
asked Sir Henry anxiously.</p>

<p><q>They are quite safe.</q></p>

<p><q>Poor things!</q> said Sir Henry, in a tone of com-
passion. <q>There will be many an aching heart
within those walls before long. But this isn't the
time for sympathy; sterner work lies before us.
I'm off for Mudkheepore.</q></p>

<p><q>And I am with you,</q> said Mr Gubbins.</p>

<p>The word was given, and in the pale light of dawn
the 32nd moved forward with the steady swing of
the British soldier.</p>

<p>Had Jean been present, it might have reminded
her of the trooping of the colours and that spring
morning in the Mall, and of Azimoolah's question:
<pb n="82"/>
<q>Do they fight as grandly as they march?</q> The
sequel proved that Jean's retort was the right one,
and that Azimoolah's countrymen could best answer
his impatient sneer.</p>

<p>There was not a man there who was not burning
to avenge the murder of the old brigadier, of Lieu-
tenant Grant, and of the young officer who died in
defence of the treasury bungalow. There was no
singing, none of the light-heartedness of men on the
march. Their faces were set, their eyes had in
them the angry concentrated look of revenge.</p>

<p>At four o'clock Sir Henry and his little army
reached Mudkheepore. The fort was occupied by
the enemy in force, over a thousand men having fled
thither from the cantonments. When they saw the
British soldiers advancing, they rushed out in
disorderly masses, without any attempt at forming
in line. Apparently they had no leader.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 32nd had been halted, awaiting the
artillery to take up its position. Immediately the
guns were unlimbered occurred one of those sudden
and curious revulsions of feeling without warning,
without premeditation, of which the Indian Mutiny
furnishes so many instances. A horseman rode
from the rebel ranks, and waved his sword before
the yet loyal cavalry. Instantly there was a move-
ment of disturbance. The troopers seemed agitated
by some irresistible impulse which attacked them
simultaneously. There was no appearance of a
concerted arrangement.</p>

<p>The four guns attached to the force were stationed
to the extreme right of the cavalry, and the officer
in command was in a position to see what was going
on. He acted with terrible promptness.</p>

<pb n="83"/>
<p>The guns were loaded and pointed towards the
distant line. The gunners were at their posts.</p>

<p><q>Fire!</q> said he.</p>

<p>The sullen roar of the cannon awoke the echoes,
and at the same moment the wavering 7th Cavalry,
with the exception of about thirty, raised a fearful
yell and galloped over to the enemy, who turned
and fled.</p>

<p><q>Will the rest of your troopers follow you?</q>
asked Sir Henry quietly of Colonel Fielden.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> answered Fielden promptly.</p>

<p><q>I doubt it. Offer them 100 rupees for every
mutineer taken or slain.</q></p>

<p>The colonel galloped up to his men, who were
still occupying their ground and taking no part in
the pursuit, and repeated Sir Henry's words. The
troopers made no answer, and evidently obeyed the
order to advance with reluctance.</p>

<p>The guns were moved slowly with the infantry,
but it was clear the cavalry could not be trusted,
and that pursuit was impossible; and after proceed-
ing a few miles the design was abandoned.</p>

<p>The scene was like the disturbance of an ants'
nest. In every direction men and women were seen
running with bundles on their heads—villagers and
camp followers making off with booty obtained in
the cantonments during the preceding night.</p>

<p>About thirty prisoners were taken, some being seized
by Commissioner Gubbins, who, with his own orderly
and three of Fisher's horse, got detached from the
rest of the cavalry; but the odd thing was, the com-
missioner did not know what to do with the fellows.</p>

<p><q>We had not,</q> said he afterwards, grimly, <q>yet
learned to kill in cold blood.</q></p>

<pb n="84"/>
<p>While Sir Henry was clearing the air outside
Lucknow, the city itself was in a seething ferment.
The streets were teaming with the Lucknow <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">bud-
mash</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">shoda</foreign>—the very scourings of the city.
Every man was armed with his tulwar, and hundreds
swaggered along with their shields of buffalo-hide
and their matchlocks and pistols.</p>

<p>The rabble reached the stone bridge, to find that
Sir Henry Lawrence had forestalled them. The
British soldiers and a half-battery of guns were
between the bridge and the cantonments. <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">Budmash</foreign>
and <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">shoda</foreign> had not the least desire for a conflict with
regular troops, and they swarmed back to their
lairs. Here they commenced a disturbance, promptly
suppressed by the police, assisted by a few faithful
companies of the irregular infantry.</p>

<p>Within the Residency confusion and alarm still
reigned. The flat roof was crowded with men,
women and children. When the musketry fire told
them the critical moment had come, all save those
who were ill ran to the highest points. With terror
in their eyes and fluttering hearts they watched the
fires blazing one after the other in the cantonments.
The musketry, sometimes in volleys, sometimes in
dropping shots, kept their nerves quivering. No
intelligence as to what was going on had reached
them; for aught they could tell, the mutineers might
have repeated the horrors of Meerut and Delhi.</p>

<p>The appearance of Lennard, calm and collected,
gladdened every heart. The doctor looked with
pity on the white faces of the ladies who crowded
round him. It was now three o'clock in the morn-
ing, and they had been watching the lurid sky
northward since nine the previous night. They were
<pb n="85"/>
haggard and worn with anxiety. Four-fifths had
husbands, brothers, lovers, in the little force which
was opposed to such fearful odds.</p>

<p>Lennard did his best to answer and soothe, but
his eyes did not meet those he most wanted to see.
At last he managed to disengage himself from the
groups of persistent and half-weeping women. He
went in search of Jean Atherton.</p>

<p>He found her seated on a wicker chair. She had
a shawl drawn over her head, and the pale light of
dawn gave an almost unearthly beauty to her face.</p>

<p><q>I could hear what you were saying, Dr Lennard,</q>
said Jean quietly, <q>so I didn't seek to monopolise
you. There are so many here who have a much
greater claim on you than I. I've no personal
friends or relatives among those brave men who are
fighting for us out yonder.</q></p>

<p><q>Personal feelings often disappear when we're
face to face with a terrible crisis like this. A com-
mon danger draws us closer to each other. Enemies
may even become friends in the face of peril,</q> re-
joined Lennard.</p>

<p><q>What has become of Captain Hawke?</q> said
Jean suddenly.</p>

<p>A footstep caused Lennard to look round.</p>

<p>It was Mrs Ross.</p>

<p>Mrs Ross seemed a little disconcerted at being
discovered, and moved away a pace or two. Lennard
bowed in acknowledgment of her presence, but did
not speak to her.</p>

<p>He went on to reply to Jean.</p>

<p><q>I can say little about Hawke. We parted soon
after the outbreak. He went off to the cantonments,
and I made the best of my way here. But you may
<pb n="86"/>
depend upon it, Miss Atherton, that where the fiercest
fighting is, Jack Hawke won't be far off.</q></p>

<p><q>That's true,</q> said a voice suddenly.</p>

<p>Mrs Ross had crept nearer to them. Why was
she so anxious to join in the conversation?</p>

<p><q>I'm glad to hear you say that, Mrs Ross,</q> said
Lennard a little coldly.</p>

<p><q>Oh, I'm not unjust,</q> answered the lady in a
peculiar tone. <q>I can even be glad to hear that
Jack Hawke is safe.</q></p>

<p><q>I didn't say anything about his safety,</q> said
Lennard. <q>There's not a man over yonder who can
hold his life as his own for a single minute. It's
more than four hours since I parted from Hawke.
Much may have happened since then.</q></p>

<p><q>Very likely. But men of Hawke's stamp aren't
the first to get shot. Providence seems to take
remarkably good care of the scoundrels.</q></p>

<p>She glided away. The bitterness of her speech
impressed Jean painfully.</p>

<p><q>Why does Mrs Ross hate Captain Hawke?</q> said
she. <q>She's been warning me against him. I should
have thought that at such a dreadful time as this,
as you said just now, all private enmity would be
forgotten.</q></p>

<p><q>Mrs Ross isn't one to forget anything,</q> said
Lennard shortly. <q>But don't let us talk about her,</q>
he went on, suddenly altering his tone. <q>You must
be in need of rest. There's nothing to fear to-
night.</q></p>

<p><q>Are you sure?</q> she inquired anxiously.</p>

<p><q>Yes, indeed. Our men are drawn up between
the cantonments and the city. The mutineers can't
pass over the stone bridge, nor can the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign> get
<pb n="87"/>
out to join them. Ah, here's your father. He'll tell
you the same thing.</q></p>

<p>Mr Atherton had come in search of his daughter.
He had been out in the streets to gather news, and
also to do his best, with the assistance of the police,
to preserve order.</p>

<p><q>There's yet hope,</q> said he. <q>The men haven't
got out of hand. I met Colonel Palmer with a loyal
remnant of the 48th Native Infantry coming from
the iron bridge. He told me that although mutiny
had broken out, and murder and fire and pillage had
begun, yet Sir Henry was more than holding his own.</q></p>

<p>For a few minutes Lennard and Atherton com-
pared notes, Jean listening anxiously the while, and
her face growing white as the doctor told how old
Brigadier Handscomb had met his death.</p>

<p><q>Poor old fellow,</q> said Atherton with a sigh. <q>It
was his fate. Well, he's beyond the reach of trouble
and anxiety. I wish we could all say the same.
Come, Jean, let's take a little rest while we can. I've
been on my legs for the last three hours and I'm
dead beat.</q></p>

<p>Jean turned, and put out her little soft hand to
the young doctor.</p>

<p><q><foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="roman">Au revoir</foreign>, Dr Lennard,</q> said she, with a grateful
smile.</p>

<p><q><foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="roman">Au revoir</foreign>. I'm glad you say that. Good-bye is
too ominous.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, you think that because you're not one of the
scoundrels, to whom, according to Mrs Ross, Pro-
vidence is so kind,</q> said she lightly. <q>I believe she
was unjust if she was alluding to Captain Hawke.</q></p>

<p><q>You're quite right, Miss Atherton,</q> said Lennard
with emphasis. <q>Hawke is no scoundrel.</q></p>

<pb n="88"/>
<p>Hawke's words, <q>If you should never see me again,
say a good word for me to that brown-eyed little
girl,</q> were fresh in Lennard's mind. Well, if he had
taken leave of Jack Hawke for ever, he had kept
his word.</p>

<p>As morning crept on apace the angry light of the
still smouldering bungalows disappeared. Wreaths
of curling smoke alone were visible. The musketry
shots had long since ceased. A faint and confused
murmur of voices came from the busy quarters of
the centre of the city.</p>

<p>Lennard's thoughts were not of Lucknow—not
even of the mutiny. Jean's sad face and large
tender eyes haunted his memory.</p>

<p><q><q>As though I'd been seeking her all my life, and
had at last found her,</q></q> said Lennard. <q>Confound
it! How many more of Jack Hawke's words am I
going to quote to-night ? He used not to be very quot-
able. Well, she's not for me nor for him either. Some
other lucky beggar perhaps has won her. Who? No
one in Lucknow, I'll swear. We're both luckier than
he, after all. We can die for her, he can only grieve.</q></p>

<p><q>Dr Lennard,</q> whispered soft tones in his ear.
He at once recognised Mrs Ross's voice.</p>

<p>Mrs Ross seemed to be hovering about him like a
ghost. What did she want now?</p>

<p>He turned towards her. He was struck with the
look of intense anxiety in her large, dark, lustrous
eyes. Usually they wore a cold, disdainful expres-
sion. Now they were liquid and almost soft.</p>

<p><q>You spoke doubtfully just now, Dr Lennard—
about Jack—I mean Captain Hawke. You said
much might happen in four hours. What <emph>has</emph>
happened? Tell me!</q></p>

<pb n="89"/>
<p><q>I don't quite understand you, Mrs Ross. I spoke
generally, of course.</q></p>

<p><q>Then Jack's safe?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know. We parted, as I told you. Since
then I haven't seen or heard of him.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah!</q></p>

<p>A sound like a suppressed sigh escaped the
woman's white lips.</p>

<p>She drew her shawl tightly about her.</p>

<p><q>Thank you, Dr Lennard,</q> she breathed, and
glided away.</p>

<p><q>What does that mean—love or hate?</q> thought
Lennard. <q>That woman has always been an enigma.
But I suppose much may be forgiven her. Heredi-
tary taint, temperament, climate and opportunity
explain a good deal. Her father, General D'Arcy,
to the day of his death, was a hard liver, and he
never troubled about his two girls. They certainly
followed his example in the way of getting as much
enjoyment out of life as possible. Was it enjoyment?
What about Mrs Ross's life when she was Edith
D'Arcy? Unlimited flirtation, a continual round of
gaiety, engaged to be married three times—bah, she
played with men's hearts as though they were
skittles. One man shot himself because of her,
another was hounded away in disgrace. Her life
ended in a marriage with a rich man who, in spite of
her scorn of him, left her all his money. But <emph>has</emph>
her life ended?</q></p>

<p>And with this question hovering in his brain he
went to snatch a few hours' sleep.</p>

<div n="6" type="chapter">
<pb n="90"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="6">VI</num></head>
<head type="main">Nurse and Patient</head>

<p>In Lucknow, on the day after the outbreak, all was
quiet. On the evening of that day, 31st May, Sir
Henry Lawrence moved his headquarters from the
cantonments into the Residency. The enthusiasm
was tremendous. When he appeared with his staff,
a perfect storm of acclamation burst forth. Loud
<q>hurrahs</q> and shouts of <q>Long life to Sir Henry</q>
continued until he had passed out of sight.</p>

<p>Then commenced preparations for defence.
Though the rebels had for a time disappeared, it
was known that they were but gathering their forces.
From all quarters came mutinous sepoys to swell
their numbers. To conquer the capital city of Oudh
was their ambition. To secure this conquest they
were prepared to make any sacrifice.</p>

<p>Sir Henry was on the alert. He did not wait to
be attacked. The Residency was crowded with
women and children. Every house and outbuildings
were occupied. Preparations for defence were con-
tinued. Thousands of coolies were employed at the
batteries, stockades and trenches. The treasure and
ammunition—of which, fortunately, there was a
large supply—were buried, and as many guns as
could be collected were brought together.</p>

<p>Never was there such a busy, motley crowd!
Soldiers—English, Irish and Scotch—sepoys,
<pb n="91"/>
prisoners in irons, men and women of all ranks,
children—black and white, of all ages—hundreds of
servants,respectable natives arriving in their carriages,
coolies carrying weights, heavy cannons, field pieces,
carts, elephants, camels, bullocks and horses, were
continually passing between the Mutcheebhawun and
the Residency. Shouting and gesticulating, bustle
and noise, and occasionally a little strong language,
were kept up from morning till night. The engineers
were blowing up buildings and endeavouring to
level as many houses as possible. The din was
deafening and incessant Sir Henry was indefatig-
able, and when he slept was a mystery to all.</p>

<p>Nine days had passed since the outbreak, and the
city, apparently, was quiet. But those who, like
Sir Henry Lawrence, were capable of penetrating
below the surface, and knew what Oriental plotting
meant, were not deceived by this apparent calm.</p>

<p>Of all the hard workers in the Residency and the
Mutcheebhawun in those anxious days while await-
ing the attack, which all knew must come before
many days were over, Jack Hawke was the hardest.
He did not seem to know what fatigue was. No-
thing came amiss to him, from searching for hidden
guns in the various suspected houses in the city,
to helping to carry in bags of flour to the stores.</p>

<p>He avoided that portion of the Residency which
had been assigned to the ladies. Those who knew
the scandal attached to his name were not surprised.</p>

<p><q>A meeting between Captain Hawke and Mrs
Ross would be exceedingly embarrassing for both,
and, of course, more embarrassing for him than for
her,</q> said one lady. <q>I don't wonder at his keeping
away.</q></p>

<pb n="92"/>
<p><q>Embarrassing or not,</q> said Mrs Hudson, a blunt
Yorkshirewoman, the wife of a colonel in the 13th
Native Infantry, <q>they'll have to meet if we're
shut up in these walls. Embarrassments won't go
for much when fighting's to be done; and in such
a case I think I know who I'd rather have with
me. It wouldn't be Mrs Ross. I mistrust that
woman.</q></p>

<p><q>Aren't you a little uncharitable, Mrs Hudson?</q>
asked Jean. She, with half-a-dozen more ladies, were
busy making lint.</p>

<p><q>Oh, maybe: but I can't help airing my opinions.
I always believe in speaking my mind. Jack
Hawke's a big, blundering fool. I've told him so
more than once in the old days; but I don't think
he's bad at heart. He hasn't got the brains to be
irreclaimably wicked.</q></p>

<p><q>But don't you think weakness is sometimes as
bad as downright wickedness? It does as much
harm, I'm sure,</q> put in an elderly lady of somewhat
grim aspect—Mrs Bartley, the widow of a com-
missioner, and a Wesleyan Methodist, with all the
conscientious views peculiar to that religious body.
<q>Captain Hawke set a shocking example to all the
young men—drinking, gambling and betting.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, he was much about the same as the rest. I
never could see that the Company's officers required
any example. When they come out to India they
take naturally to pale ale and brandy pawnees. The
first duty of an Anglo-Indian, whether he's in the
Army or the Civil Service, is to ruin his liver as
speedily as possible. Jack Hawke arrived in Calcutta
a mere boy, and he was unlucky in having too much
money, and in falling in with a fast set. The D'Arcy
<pb n="93"/>
girls would ruin any young man—they ruined Jack
Hawke.</q></p>

<p>Mrs Bartley did not dispute this assertion. Indeed
her opinion of the <q>D'Arcy girls</q> was even more
severe than that of Mrs Hudson; but she adhered
to her belief that Hawke was a most disreputable,
unprincipled, worldly-minded young man. Another
lady thought he was <q>horrid,</q> and a third considered
it was a great pity that he had come back to Lucknow.</p>

<p>The talked jarred upon Jean, whose impulses were
generous and forgiving. Hawke interested her. She
knew nothing about his drinking habits, his gambling,
his betting. The sinister insinuations of Mrs Ross
had not resulted in prejudicing her against him, if,
indeed, that was Mrs Ross's object. Jean knew he
was a brave man—her father and Dr Lennard had
said so—and bravery covered a multitude of sins.</p>

<p><q>It's unjust,</q> thought the girl indignantly, <q>to look
only on the one side of anybody's character, and that
side the worst.</q></p>

<p>Suddenly the conversation veered round to the
<q>D'Arcy girls,</q> and some of the scandalised elderly
ladies had a good deal to say concerning their flirta-
tions and their <soCalled>fast</soCalled> ways generally.</p>

<p><q>What became of them?</q> asked a lady, who had
not been in India long.</p>

<p><q>One of them—Agnes—married a Mr Holcombe,
and she went home to England with her husband.
It was over her there was such a scandal with
Captain Hawke. It drove him away.</q></p>

<p><q>And the other?</q></p>

<p><q>Edith D'Arcy? Why, she's Mrs Ross, of course.
Didn't you know that?</q></p>

<p>Jean started. She had not the least idea that one
<pb n="94"/>
of the D'Arcy girls, remembered for their beauty as
for their recklessness, was now Mrs Ross. It seemed
inconceivable that this woman, with the worn, almost
haggard face, sallow complexion and bitter tongue,
could have been the fascinating girl about whom half
the men at the station raved. But beauty ripens
quickly in India, and it might be that Mrs Ross, who
could not be yet thirty, had burned the candle of life
too rapidly. Her features were certainly exquisitely
regular, and her eyes remarkably fine; while her
voice, soft, low and musical, was capable of infinite
modulation. But the expression? At times it was
one of settled melancholy, at others it seemed to show
that the fever of unrest was burning within. She
had been a widow scarcely a twelvemonth when the
mutiny broke out, and to Jean the faded look on the
woman's face was amply accounted for.</p>

<p>According to Mrs Hudson, the D'Arcy girls had
been the ruin of Hawke. What did this mean?</p>

<p>Well, it was no affair of hers, and tired of the
scandalmongering, and with fingers stiff and sore
with work, Jean rose from her seat, walked to the
window, and looked out on the busy scene below.</p>

<p>A long procession of natives carrying burdens on
their heads were coming in through the Baillie Guard
Gate.</p>

<p>They were provision bearers. Then followed
a team of bullocks, dragging a heavy gun, the drivers
urging them on with shrill cries and hoarse maledic-
tions. They were under the charge of three or four
European officers.</p>

<p>Suddenly she saw one of the latter apparently trip
over a package a careless native had let fall, and
come heavily to the ground. She could not see pre-
<pb n="95"/>
cisely what had happened, for the bullocks swerved
round. All she knew was that the man's brother
officers had rushed to help him.</p>

<p>At that moment she was called away from the
window. The chief of the medical staff, Dr Mac-
pherson, had entered the room, and was addressing
the ladies generally.</p>

<p>He was a short, burly, bluff man of about fifty,
a splendid surgeon, and despite his roughness, with
the kindest heart in the world for the genuine
sufferer.</p>

<p><q>Now, leedies,</q> said he, with just the slightest
flavour of Northern accent, <q>I want to have a few
words with ye all. We've got serious work maybe
before us, and we mustn't be taken by surprise.
We'll have need of plenty of nurses, so the sooner
some of ye learn the preliminaries—bandaging and
what not—the better. Who'll volunteer?</q></p>

<p><q>If I can be of any use, doctor?</q> began Jean.</p>

<p><q>Of use, lassie. Why, I'll make a first-rate nurse
of ye in less than no time. That's one. Who's next?
Don't be in too much of a hurry to speak. Mrs
Hudson, I can reckon on you, I know.</q></p>

<p>Yes, Mrs Hudson was quite willing, and so were
half-a-dozen more.</p>

<p>Quite proud of his success, the doctor led the way
to the banqueting hall, which had been turned into
a hospital. A good many sick had been brought
into the Residency when shelter was first sought
there, and some half-a-score of wounded, the result
of the outbreak of the 30th, had been added since.</p>

<p>Dr Macpherson was just beginning a little lecture
when the tramp of feet was heard outside, mixed
with a bumping sound, the meaning of which the
<pb n="96"/>
surgeon knew full well. It was the arrival of a
patient borne on a litter.</p>

<p>An orderly opened the door, and Dr Macpherson
went hastily forward.</p>

<p><q>Case of sunstroke, sir,</q> said the young officer who
accompanied the party, <q>and an accident besides.
Gun carriage wheel went over his arm, but I don't
think it's broken. It was on the loose sand, luckily.</q></p>

<p><q>Ay, ay. Bring him this way. Put him on this
bed. Ye're just in time, leedies, to have a vera
useful preliminary lesson. Ye'll have many sunstroke
cases to look after, and it's as well ye should know
as soon as possible how to deal with them.</q></p>

<p>The man was lifted gently on to the bed, and the
women, after a little hesitation, went forward.</p>

<p>Jean was in advance, but the man's face was
turned from her. Mrs Hudson, who was on the
other side, exclaimed:</p>

<p><q>Why, it's poor Jack Hawke!</q></p>

<p>The doctor's eyes fell upon Jean, and he told her
to come nearer, so that she might watch what he did.</p>

<p><q>This isn't a vera serious case, and I'm glad of it.
We can't afford to lose so fine a lad.</q></p>

<p>Hawke was a stranger to the surgeon, who had
not been long in Lucknow.</p>

<p>The doctor administered restoratives, and eventu-
ally Hawke opened his eyes; but he had only half
regained consciousness. He stared vacantly round.</p>

<p><q>A couple of days' rest and he'll be all right.
The arm will be much longer in getting well. It's
badly sprained and bruised. There'll be plenty
of lotioning and cold-water bandaging for you, Miss
Atherton. He shall be your first patient, and I put
him under your care.</q></p>

<pb n="97"/>
<p><q>Dr Macpherson,</q> hurriedly exclaimed Mrs
Bartley, <q>just one word.</q></p>

<p>There was a look of concern on Mrs Bartley's face,
as though she had something very important to say.
The good-natured doctor turned aside. She said
something to him in a whisper.</p>

<p><q>Pooh! Nonsense! Don't be ridiculous, woman!</q>
Dr Macpherson was heard to say quite sharply.
Whereat Mrs Bartley tossed her head, sniffed, and
put on a resigned, deprecatory attitude, as much as
to say, <q>Well, I've done my duty. For whatever
happens, please remember I'm not responsible.</q></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, she had whispered to the
surgeon, that, in her opinion, a young and handsome
girl ought not to be put to nurse a good-looking
dare-devil of a fellow like Jack Hawke.</p>

<p>Macpherson turned back rather irritably to the
patient. He hated any interference with his orders,
and nothing put him out so much. Nevertheless,
he cast a shrewd glance at both Jean and Hawke.</p>

<p><q>He's a braw lad, and she's a bonnie lassie,</q> he
muttered to himself, <q>but she's no fule. Plenty of
decision in that handsome face of hers, though,
maybe, she hasn't yet been worried about deciding
anything more important than the shape of a bonnet
or the fit of a frock. He'll be out of this place in
two days, or three at the most.</q></p>

<p>And so it came to pass that Jean's first experience
of nursing was to keep Jack Hawke's left arm well
supplied with wet bandages. The duty was not
a very arduous one, and only entailed visits to the
hospital at stated times.</p>

<p>It would be untrue to say that Jean did not feel
an interest in her patient. His tawny hair was cut
<pb n="98"/>
close to his head by order of the doctor, and the
mass of rings which formerly came rather low down
in front, no longer hid his broad rather than high
forehead.</p>

<p>He lay very quiet all that day, and seemed quite
content to watch Jean's soft white fingers deftly
applying the cool white bandages. Not a word
escaped his lips. The effect of the sunstroke seemed
to partake of the nature of semi-paralysis, and for
some hours he remained in a kind of lethargy,
conscious of what was going on, and quite aware of
the ministrations of his nurse and accepting every-
thing in a dreamy, helpless condition.</p>

<p>The coolness of the night air worked wonders, and
about an hour before midnight he fell into a deep
sleep. At five o'clock he awoke. The hospital
orderly happened to be near him.</p>

<p>He cast a quick glance round, and seemed as if
he were making a strong effort to pull himself
together.</p>

<p><q>Orderly,</q> said he, abruptly, <q>what are the arrange-
ments here? Will the same nurse—lady, I mean,
attend me to-day?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know, sir. I suppose so.</q></p>

<p>Hawke was silent for a moment, and then said:</p>

<p><q>Can you shave?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, sir.</q></p>

<p><q>Then just take off this stubble. You'll find a
rupee in the pocket of that waistcoat. I shall look
a little less like a scarecrow with my chin a bit
cleaner,</q> he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>The orderly was only too glad to earn the rupee,
and when his beard of a week's growth was removed,
Hawke looked quite a gentleman. He insisted on
<pb n="99"/>
rising in spite of the orderly's arguments that he
would be much better in bed. <q>A fellow looks like
a molly-coddle,</q> was his rejoinder. <q>Besides I feel
as fit as a fiddle, save this confounded arm of mine.</q></p>

<p><q>You don't look it, sir. Your eyes are queer.</q></p>

<p><q>So would yours be if you'd been working for
three days in the blazing sun. I'm a little giddy
about the nut, but that'll pass off in a few hours.
Can you give me a brandy pawnee?</q></p>

<p><q>Not without the doctor's orders.</q></p>

<p><q>Hang the doctor! Well, what time did you say
my lady attendant was expected?</q></p>

<p><q>About seven, sir, and it's now six. If you like
I could change these bandages for you. They're
very dry.</q></p>

<p><q>Let them alone, will you?</q> said Hawke
fiercely.</p>

<p>He dressed himself with the assistance of the
orderly, and awaited Jean's coming, his eyes con-
stantly wandering to the clock on the wall, as though
time didn't move quickly enough for him.</p>

<p>At last she appeared, and his face brightened.</p>

<p><q>Are you better?</q> said she.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> he said slowly, <q>thanks to you. You've
been very kind.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, it's nothing,</q> she answered lightly, and at
the same time a little nervously. The strange light
in his ardent eyes was something she was not used
to. <q>It's only the duty of the women to help in the
hospital work. Unhappily, we can do no more.</q></p>

<p><q>It's everything. But some of the men here are
not worth the trouble.</q></p>

<p><q>Why do you say that?</q></p>

<p>She was taking off the bandages and she felt him
<pb n="100"/>
wince. His arm was terribly bruised and battered
and the skin was broken.</p>

<p><q>Ah, I hurt you. I'm so sorry. It's my awkward-
ness, but I hope to improve.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't mind being experimented upon by you,
Miss Atherton,</q> said he; <q>if you become proficient
through practising on my arm, it'll show, anyhow,
that I'm not altogether good for nothing.</q></p>

<p>Again he looked at her with that fiery glance.
She felt a little embarrassed; perhaps he noticed it,
for he was silent while she replaced the dry bandages
with wet ones.</p>

<p><q>And now, I suppose, you'll go and make some
other lucky beggar feel he's had a glimpse of heaven,</q>
said he huskily.</p>

<p><q>I'm glad the cool wet rags give you so much relief,</q>
said she, wilfully misunderstanding him.</p>

<p><q>Hang the rags! I beg your pardon, Miss Atherton,
When I spoke of heaven just now I didn't refer to
this arm of mine.</q></p>

<p><q>I know you did not. But you musn't say such
things, please.</q></p>

<p><q>When are you coming again?</q> he anxiously
asked.</p>

<p><q>Dr Macpherson said every three hours the band-
ages were to be changed.</q></p>

<p><q>They'll be stiff and dry long before then. Mac
doesn't know what this fiendish climate can do.
Two hours—say you'll come in two hours?</q></p>

<p><q>Very well,</q> she interposed hastily, <q>I'll return in
two hours' time.</q></p>

<p>He gave her a grateful look, and she glided away.</p>

<head type="main">The Green-Eyed Monster</head>

<p>As Jean was hastening along the corridor, she
suddenly came face to face with Mrs Ross. The
latter had entered the corridor from a narrow passage
leading to the rooms occupied by the ladies. The
light, feeble as it was, enabled Jean to see that the
woman was strangely agitated. Her face was deadly
pale, her lips worked convulsively, her hands trembled
with excitement.</p>

<p><q>Miss Atherton,</q> exclaimed Mrs Ross fiercely,
feverishly, <q>is it true you've charge of Captain Hawke,
now in the hospital? I was very unwell all yesterday,
and have only just heard of it.</q></p>

<p><q>Captain Hawke has badly bruised and sprained
his arm, and Dr Macpherson asked me to renew
the bandages. I don't know whether that means
that he is under my charge,</q> answered Jean quietly.</p>

<p>Mrs Ross's breath came quick and short.</p>

<p><q>You remember I warned you against him?</q> she
burst out.</p>

<p><q>Oh yes, I remember perfectly well. You didn't
explain why.</q></p>

<p><q>There was no necessity. You were fresh from
England, and why should an old scandal in which
you have no personal interest be raked up? I
thought it was sufficient to caution you about the
danger of associating with Captain Hawke.</q></p>

<pb n="102"/>
<p><q>You're mistaken,</q> said Jean, her cheek flushing
with annoyance. <q>I am not associating with Captain
Hawke. Dr Macpherson wanted as many ladies as
possible to learn something about hospital nursing,
lest our services should be required. It's purely an
accident that has forced upon me the duty of attending
Captain Hawke. I fail to see why I should be
answerable to you, Mrs Ross, for anything I may
do.</q></p>

<p>Jean was angry. Mrs Ross's anxiety and absurd
officiousness annoyed her. Did the woman imagine
she was about to fall in love with Hawke? No
wonder her face crimsoned.</p>

<p>To her surprise, Mrs Ross did not, as she expected,
return a tart answer. Her manner changed; her
voice softened.</p>

<p><q>Forgive me, dear Miss Atherton. Of course,
I've no right to make suggestions to you. I was only
thinking of my own unhappy girlhood. I pity anyone
who makes the same mistake as I did. You're not
offended, are you?</q></p>

<p>Mrs Ross held out her hand. Jean could not help
taking it. Mrs Ross was apologetic, conciliatory,
almost humble.</p>

<p><q>Now,</q> she went on, <q>we all ought to be friends,
and yet it seems to me that since we've been shut up
in the Residency there have been more bickerings
and quarrels than ever.</q></p>

<p>This was quite true. Anglo-Indian society in those
days was a mass of frivolity and jealousy, always
accentuated when people have plenty of money and
little to do. The wives and daughters of the officers
and civilian officials took their personal enmities with
them into the Residency. Until the actual siege
<pb n="103"/>
began, when the better part of human nature came
out, the place was a hotbed of gossip and petty
disagreements, not always good-natured and harm-
less.</p>

<p>The heat and the strained condition of the nerves
were no doubt answerable for a good deal of this
irritability. Maybe not a little was due to the
enforced crowding together of ill-assorted natures
which jarred upon each other.</p>

<p><q>Let's go into this little room and talk there,</q>
said Mrs Ross suddenly. <q>It faces the north. It's
as cool as the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>, and much pleasanter with
the open window looking on the river.</q></p>

<p>Jean consented, and they sat down on the low
basket seats. The light fell athwart Mrs Ross's face,
and her profile, faultless in contour, showed sharply
and distinctly against the wall behind. Where Jean
was sitting it came distinctly into view, and she was
struck by its strangely un-English look.</p>

<p>With all its regularity, it was an enigmatical face.
Calm and impassive as now, there was something
which suggested that her nature could rise to heights
of passion undreamt of by placid people with even
temperaments.</p>

<p><q>You in England don't understand quarrels
ending in death,</q> said Mrs Ross, with a peculiar
smile.</p>

<p><q>Oh, there are such things, but they don't happen
often.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah! In India death, sooner or later, ends all
quarrels. We hate with our whole souls.</q></p>

<p><q>We?</q> repeated Jean wonderingly.</p>

<p><q>Didn't you know I had Indian blood in my
veins?</q></p>

<pb n="104"/>
<p>Mrs Ross laughed. It wasn't a pleasant laugh.
Jean had heard many such in the streets of
Lucknow.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> she went on, <q>my grandfather, Colonel
D'Arcy, was one of Lord Clive's officers. He married
the daughter of an Indian rajah. They say I'm like
her.</q></p>

<p>Mrs Ross leaned back in her chair, and raising her
arms clasped her hands behind her head. She had
crossed her knees, and one foot was lazily swinging.</p>

<p>In her were all the typical characteristics of the
Hindoo woman. The feet and hands, the ankles and
wrists, were small and delicately fashioned; the
forehead low, the chin beautifully rounded. Her
attitude and expression just then were of the
languorous warmth and the love of repose which
belong to the East.</p>

<p>They chatted on trivial matters, as women do
when they feel there is one subject it is not safe
for either to approach. Suddenly, in the middle of
a sentence, Mrs Ross sprang to her feet. Her keen
eyes had caught sight of a couple of horsemen
galloping in at the Baillie Guard Gate. A few
musket shots could be heard some distance away.</p>

<p><q>What's the matter?</q> cried Jean.</p>

<p><q>Who can say?</q> returned Mrs Ross, with a flash
like midnight lightning from her dark eyes. <q>Aren't
we living on a volcano? Who knows when it may
burst into flame?</q></p>

<p>They watched the two horsemen gallop to one of
the doors of the Residency, and throw themselves
from their horses. Instantly there was a commotion,
and a dozen men or more were seen running to the
stables.</p>

<pb n="105"/>
<p>No cause for alarm could be seen. But Jean felt
horribly nervous. She declared she must inquire
what had happened.</p>

<p><q>Do as you like,</q> said Mrs Ross. <q>Anyhow, if
it's bad news we shall hear of it soon enough.</q></p>

<p>Jean ran towards Sir Henry Lawrence's quarters.
She met an officer with whom she had some slight
acquaintance, and begged him to tell her what was
going on.</p>

<p><q>The infantry police have followed the example
of their gallant comrades the cavalry,</q> said he, <q>and
joined the rebels.</q></p>

<p>The officer bowed to Jean and darted away. The
girl went back where she had left Mrs Ross, but
found that she was gone. Men's shouts and oaths
came from the street. She ran to the window.</p>

<p>What could only be called an awkward squad was
going in chase of the mutineers. The men had
rushed to the stables, or to any place where they
were likely to find a horse. They seized what they
could.</p>

<p>A field piece was being dragged along by some
wretched-looking animals, and a few volunteers had
found seats on the tumbril. The infantry could not
be got ready in time, so the mounted men did not
wait, but went out helter-skelter. No order or
formation could be kept. Very few of the Europeans
were military men, and the regulars were represented
by sixty or seventy Sikhs.</p>

<p>Agitated by what she had seen, and by thoughts
of what might follow, Jean slowly made her way
back to the hospital.</p>

<p>Do what she could, the caution which Mrs Ross
persisted in giving her respecting Hawke was upper-
<pb n="106"/>
most in her mind. She wished Mrs Ross had said
nothing. It made her think of the man otherwise
than as simply a patient, and for this she had no
desire. What was Captain Hawke to her? For
all that as she entered the room, the colour on her
face deepened.</p>

<p>It was impossible for her not to be conscious of
the change which went over Hawke's countenance
when he saw her enter. The gloom, the anxiety
disappeared: his features became restful.</p>

<p><q>I thought you were never coming,</q> said he
eagerly. <q>The time has passed so slowly.</q></p>

<p><q>You make a very bad patient, Captain Hawke,</q>
was Jean's reply. <q>You're too impatient.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I suppose so. Yet I think I could be patient,
if—if <emph>you</emph> bade me hope.</q></p>

<p>What did the man mean? She resolved to fix her
mind on the routine of the duty and take no notice
of anything beyond. She asked him for no explana-
tion, but went on preparing her cold-water bandages.
Perhaps he saw that she wasn't inclined to talk, for
he was silent, and contented himself with watching her.</p>

<p><q>I'm an ass,</q> he muttered savagely. <q>I'd better
hold my tongue or I shall say something that may
embarrass or offend her, and that'll shut me up.</q></p>

<p>Jean clearly was improving with practice, for the
renewal of the bandages took a shorter time than
ever. At least, it seemed so to Hawke.</p>

<p>Having completed her task she rose, and would
have taken her leave silently, in pursuance of her
resolution to be a nurse and nothing but a nurse.
But she saw the eager, yearning look in his eyes, and
it seemed heartless to go without a word. Hawke,
at any rate, had no intention that she should.</p>

<pb n="107"/>
<p><q>When will you visit me again?</q> he asked, implor-
ingly.</p>

<p><q>At the proper time,</q> said she, with decision.</p>

<p><q>Ah, yes, of course. I couldn't expect otherwise,</q>
he returned in a dull tone.</p>

<p>She walked swiftly across the room, and went out.
His eyes followed her.</p>

<p><q>Jack.</q></p>

<p>Mrs Ross had approached unseen, and was stand-
ing by his side.</p>

<p><q>Why do you come here?</q> he asked, recovering
himself with an effort.</p>

<p><q>Is that girl your latest conquest?</q></p>

<p><q>I've nothing to say to you, Mrs Ross. You've
done me injury enough. Leave me alone. Go.</q></p>

<p><q>Not yet. I want to talk to you about Jean
Atherton. May I ask if you've acquainted her with
certain interesting events in your past life, or do you
wish other people to save you the trouble?</q></p>

<p>He bit his white lips, and his nostrils quivered with
passion.</p>

<p><q>You, for instance?</q> he replied in a low hoarse
tone.</p>

<p><q>Oh yes, if you like.</q></p>

<p><q>What have I done to you, Edith Ross, that you
should pursue me so bitterly, so mercilessly?</q></p>

<p><q>Pursue you? Why have you come back to be
pursued? You know my feelings towards you.
They haven't changed—they never will change. The
only love I've ever had for man I gave to you, Jack.</q></p>

<p><q>I wish to heaven I'd never seen your face,</q> said
he, scowlingly.</p>

<p><q>Amen to that,</q> she cried, with heaving heart and
quivering lip; <q>but it was to be. How can we
<pb n="108"/>
escape our fate? Just think. Didn't we, five years
ago, bid each other farewell? and——</q></p>

<p><q>Did we say farewell?</q> he asked ironically. <q>I
thought we parted with mutual execrations. I per-
fectly remember what <emph>my</emph> feelings were.</q></p>

<p><q>If I said anything that was bitter, forgive me,</q>
she exclaimed passionately. <q>Don't you know I
would crawl in the dust, humble myself before you
for one smile, one fond word such as you used to give
me?</q></p>

<p><q>I know I was a silly young fool, or I shouldn't
have forged George Holcombe's name to get you
money, after I'd spent every farthing of my own.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I tempted you, I own; but no harm came of
it. George made it right with the bank, and no one
knew anything about the matter.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you call the contempt of George Holcombe
nothing? Was giving up your sister Agnes nothing?
My love for her is an old memory now; it was real
enough then. I believe it nearly broke my heart when
I told her, disgraced as I was, I couldn't become her
husband. And what happened afterwards?</q></p>

<p>His brow became black as midnight.</p>

<p><q>Yes, yes, I know,</q> she replied hurriedly. <q>We
needn't recall <emph>that</emph> incident.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, but it's as well we should keep it in our
minds. <emph>I</emph> intend to do so. Perhaps you've forgotten
the particulars. I'll refresh your memory. George
Holcombe received certain scandalous anonymous
letters reflecting on his wife. They contained allu-
sions to matters which could only be known to her,
to me, and to one other person. The letters were in
my handwriting, or near enough, and they were
posted by my own servant. He swore, you remember,
<pb n="109"/>
that I gave them to him. What could I do or say
against such evidence? Wasn't it better I should
clear out of Lucknow? What's <emph>your</emph> opinion?</q></p>

<p>Edith Ross moved her dry lips, but no sound came
from them.</p>

<p><q>I think we've nothing more to talk about,</q> he
went on coldly. <q>I don't understand, since circum-
stances have forced me to meet you again, why you
should choose to persecute and slander me.</q></p>

<p><q>That <emph>is</emph> it—you don't understand.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well; let it remain so. I always was slow
in reading women. Now let's drop the subject.</q></p>

<p><q>And Jean Atherton?</q> she asked huskily.</p>

<p><q>Ah</q>—he drew a long breath—<q>if the time ever
comes when I may speak freely to Jean Atherton, I
sha'n't sail under false colours. I think,</q> he went on
musingly, and apparently not caring whether the
woman heard him or not, <q>death itself wouldn't be
unwelcome, if I knew she loved me. And, by heaven,
she <emph>shall</emph> love me.</q></p>

<p>Every syllable lashed Edith Ross like the sting of
a whip. Her shapely, delicate fingers were inter-
twined, and pressed till they were almost bloodless.</p>

<p>She rose, every nerve quivering with fierce
passion.</p>

<p><q>And you think she will?</q> she cried. <q>We'll see.
You pretend to scorn the hand of fate. It may be
your destiny to be tortured as I've been tortured.
Or maybe, you'll come to me to help you, as you
came in the old days to ask me to help you to gain
the love of Agnes——</q></p>

<p><q>Who was as heartless as yourself, and cared for
me as little as——</q></p>

<p><q>As Jean Atherton.</q></p>

<pb n="110"/>
<p>The strain on her nerves was too intense to be
borne in the presence of Jack Hawke. With a face
like marble, she hastened from the hospital.</p>

<p>Alone in the corridor, Mrs Ross could have burst
into a flood of tears, but with a strong effort of
will she restrained herself. Her nerves were over-
wrought, her senses confused, and it was with difficulty
she found her way back to her room, which she
shared with other ladies.</p>

<p>Fortunately they were absent, having gone to the
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign> for coolness. She flung herself on the bed,
and there lay for hours, exhausted, and more dead
than alive.</p>

<p>About eight o'clock the grounds of the Residency
were filled with an excited crowd. The detachment
of improvised cavalry, the two field pieces, and the
two companies of the 32nd despatched to punish the
mutineering military police, had returned weary and
footsore. They had had a long and trying march on
an exceptionally hot day, and what was much worse,
had done very little good.</p>

<p>They had not succeeded in having a fair blow at
the main body. The cavalry could have reached the
enemy, but were not allowed to charge. Though
their hearts were good, they were not disciplined
warriors, and the result might have been disastrous,
so broken and difficult was the ground. The guns
did a little execution, but the infantry came up too
late to be of any use.</p>

<p>Edith Ross had by this time recovered her com-
posure, and with the other ladies went to see the
returning force march—if the limping, halting gait
of the exhausted men could be called a march—
through the Baillie Guard Gate.</p>

<pb n="111"/>
<p>Some ten prisoners had been captured; they were
tied together by a rope, and passed very close to
where the women were standing. One man in the
dress of a bhistie, or water-carrier, attracted their
attention. His face was not that of a low-class
native. He had a beard and moustache and a pair
of remarkably keen piercing eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a commotion in the group.</p>

<p><q>Mrs Ross has fainted,</q> exclaimed someone
hastily.</p>

<p>At that moment the water-carrier paused, and his
flashing eyes remained fixed on the figure of the
half-senseless woman.</p>

<p>Mrs Ross's unconsciousness lasted but a short
time. She was not a weak-nerved woman, but that
day of violent emotion and revulsion of feeling
had been a trying one.</p>

<p>She had received a terrible shock. In the water-
carrier who had been brought in as a prisoner she
recognised the one man in India whom she least
desired to meet. Azimoolah Khan! This man had
been Jack Hawke's confidential native servant in the
days of the reckless young officer's prosperity,
when he gambled and betted and drank, and went
through the whole gamut of Anglo-Indian vice.</p>

<p><q>Are you better?</q> said a girl's voice.</p>

<p>Jean Atherton was by her side. Edith Ross had
not regained her self-command, and she could not
disguise the look of hatred which flashed across her
features when she recognised Jean.</p>

<p><q>Oh yes, I'm better, thank you,</q> she rejoined in a
dry, hollow tone.</p>

<p>At that moment Ernest Lennard came up and
one of the ladies hastily told him what had happened.</p>

<pb n="112"/>
<p><q>I should advise you to take a long rest,</q> said he,
with a searching glance at Mrs Ross.</p>

<p><q>Excellent advice if it only could be followed,</q>
she replied. <q>Give me your arm, Dr Lennard. I
want to talk to you.</q></p>

<p>He obeyed. They separated themselves from the
group of ladies. But despite Mrs Ross's expressed
desire to talk, she said nothing. As a matter of
fact, all she wanted was to get away from the
sympathy of her friends.</p>

<p>Lennard was not surprised at her silence. It was
only natural. A fainting fit was generally followed
by lassitude and exhaustion. He made no reference
to it, but talked on other subjects.</p>

<p><q>It's a pity,</q> said he, <q>Colonel Inglis couldn't
have given the rebel police a sharp lesson. As it is,
they've got safely away, free either to go on to
Cawnpore or to join the other mutineers, and attack
us in Lucknow when the time comes. All we have
to show for our day's work are those ten prisoners I
saw being taken into the Baillie Guard.</q></p>

<p><q>Into the Baillie Guard?</q> repeated Mrs Ross.
<q>What will be done with them?</q></p>

<p><q>The sepoys of the party may be hanged. The
others, the villagers—I noticed a grass-cutter and a
water-carrier—may be released. It depends upon
what they were doing.</q></p>

<p>Dr Lennard had by this time conducted Mrs Ross
to the main entrance of the Residency.</p>

<p><q>Thank you,</q> said she, <q>I feel much better. I
think I can mount the stairs to my room without
any assistance. I'll release you, Dr Lennard, so
you'll now be able to devote yourself entirely to
Miss Atherton.</q></p>

<pb n="113"/>
<p>She said this with a suspicion of malice, partly
because she had noticed the young doctor's atten-
tions, and partly because she could never think of
Jean without bitterness.</p>

<p>Edith Ross fixed her dark glittering eyes on
Lennard, and did not fail to note the effect of her
words.</p>

<p><q>He's in love with her,</q> she thought. <q>So much
the better. If I could bring about an engagement
between them it would settle Jack Hawke. But
that must wait. I've something much more pressing
to think of.</q></p>

<p>The shadows of evening were lengthening apace.
The sun had nearly dipped below the horizon. The
white cupolas, minarets and towers of Lucknow
were tinted with a rosy glow. Mrs Ross ascended
to her room, and sat watching the west till the sun
had wholly disappeared. Then changing her white
dress for a darker one, which in the grey light would
not be readily noticeable, she stole out. She went
in the direction of the Baillie Guard.</p>

<p>The Baillie Guard was a continuation of that
portion of the Residency which had been converted
into the hospital, built on ground to which one had
to descend considerably. A portion of it was used
as a store-room, another as a treasure depository,
and the remainder as offices and the barracks of the
native soldiers who had remained faithful to their
allegiance.</p>

<p>Within one of the smaller rooms of the Baillie
Guard, the captured natives had been temporarily
confined.</p>

<p>The officer on duty for the night was of that
immature age and experience when a man has a
<pb n="114"/>
tendency to fall in love with a woman older than
himself. His infatuation amused Mrs Ross, and she
permitted Lieutenant Hilton at times to flirt mildly
with her. At others, she snubbed him unmercifully.</p>

<p>He was standing in the doorway, smoking a
cheroot, when she stole softly up to him.</p>

<p><q>Is it you, Mrs Ross?</q> he exclaimed.</p>

<p><q>Why not? But I suppose you would rather it
were someone else.</q></p>

<p><q>Hang it all, not likely. But you haven't come
to see me, I'll bet.</q></p>

<p><q>Why not? Anyhow, you don't seem particularly
glad to see me, so I'll go away.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't—don't,</q> he pleaded. <q>I am glad—awfully
glad. I thought I'd offended you. I passed you
twice to-day and you never noticed me.</q></p>

<p><q>Poor fellow,</q> said she, in the melting tones
always at her command. She held out her hand in
token of amity, and the enraptured youth raised it
to his lips.</p>

<p><q>There, that'll do. You needn't hold my fingers
so tightly.</q></p>

<p><q>I should like to hold them for ever,</q> he mur-
mured.</p>

<p><q>Don't be silly. I suppose you're on duty now,
Fred, and that I'm doing wrong in talking to you.</q></p>

<p>It was the first time she had called him Fred, and
the monosyllable from her lips thrilled him to the
finger-tips.</p>

<p><q>You can't do wrong in my eyes, Edith. I may
call you Edith—mayn't I?</q></p>

<p><q>Perhaps—if you behave yourself very nicely.
But I mustn't be seen here. Suppose any of your
brother officers were to pass.</q></p>

<pb n="115"/>
<p>She allowed him to hold her hand, and the poor
lad, overcome with such condescension, scarcely
knew whether he was standing on his head or his
heels.</p>

<p><q>Do you know why I came to see you?</q> said
she, fingering a button on his uniform. <q>I felt so
dull, I wanted someone nice to talk to me.</q></p>

<p>Lieutenant Hilton was delighted.</p>

<p><q>No; you don't mean it? How awfully jolly of
you.</q></p>

<p>Her hair brushed his cheek, and had he dared he
would have kissed it, but he always had a fearful
joy in flirting with Edith Ross. He never knew
when she was in the mood for unlimited admiration.</p>

<p>Suddenly she drew herself back.</p>

<p><q>What's that noise?</q> she asked.</p>

<p><q>Those prisoners who were brought in about an
hour ago. What a jolly row the beggars are making.
I'll make 'em shut up if you like.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, it doesn't matter at all, now that I know
the meaning of the noise. I'm so interested in
prisons and prisoners. They always make me think
of Baron Trenck, the Man in the Iron Mask, the
Prisoner of Chillon, and half-a-dozen more. There's
so much romance in a prison. Don't you think so?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know. I've never seen any romance in
a prison. I've seen a good deal of dirt,</q> said the
prosaic Hilton.</p>

<p><q>I should so awfully like to know what the inside
of a prison's like. Mayn't I have just one peep?</q>
said she, glancing upwards.</p>

<p><q>I wouldn't if I were you—you won't like it.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, but I must. I've set my heart upon it.</q></p>

<p>Lieutenant Hilton laughed. A pretty woman's
<pb n="116"/>
whim must be gratified. He conducted her along
a passage to the door of a room, in front of which a
couple of sentries were posted. At the young
officer's orders the door was opened a little way.</p>

<p><q>Oh, but I can't see,</q> objected the lady. <q>I want
to go in altogether and feel that I'm really in
prison.</q></p>

<p>Hilton allowed her to enter. A smoky lamp was
hanging in the centre of the room. Its lurid light
obscured rather than revealed the men squatted on
the ground huddled together. At the extreme end
was the bhistie, his eyes glowing like coals from
beneath his dark, lowering brows.</p>

<p><q>May I say a word to any of them?</q> inquired
Mrs Ross, with soft timidity.</p>

<p><q>If you like. <emph>I</emph> don't mind.</q></p>

<p>The lady spoke to the water-carrier in his own
language. It was unintelligible to Hilton, whose
knowledge of Hindustani was very limited. But
even he, guileless, as he was, noticed that the way
the man answered Mrs Ross angered her. This was
what passed between the two:</p>

<p><q>I thought Mrs Ross would contrive to pay the
poor water-carrier a visit,</q> said the man, with a
covert sneer.</p>

<p><q>Why are you here, Azimoolah?</q></p>

<p><q>The mem-sahib can herself answer that question.
Was I not brought here by her countrymen?</q></p>

<p><q>But you were near Lucknow. Didn't you
promise me you'd never visit the city, and didn't
I pay you well for that promise?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh yes, five years ago. But the Azimoolah who
was Captain Hawke's servant then is not the Azi-
moolah of to-day. Don't you know that since that
<pb n="117"/>
time I've gained power, wealth—that the Nana
himself is but a puppet in my hands? Have I not
been across the black water to England? Ay, and
the bright eyes of English ladies, as fair as the mem-
sahib herself, have brightened at my coming.</q></p>

<p>Mrs Ross had heard nothing of this. It seemed
incredible.</p>

<p><q>It's a lie,</q> she exclaimed angrily.</p>

<p><q>It's the truth; but I trust to Mrs Ross to keep
my secret. It will be good for her own sake to do
so. I know Captain Hawke is here, and he will
recognise me if you betray me. What shall I say
then? That you bribed me to forge his handwriting?
That you paid me to write scandalous letters to Mr
Holcombe? That you again paid me to post them,
and swear that I did so by the order of Captain
Hawke?</q></p>

<p>Hot and stifling as the room was, the woman
shivered.</p>

<p>All the blood in her body seemed to rush to her
heart. Yet it was necessary to master her feelings.
Was not this young Englishman standing close by
and watching them? He might be suspicious though
he did not understand a word they said.</p>

<p><q>You won't do that, Azimoolah,</q> she forced herself
to reply as calmly as she could. <q>I've never injured
you, and I paid you well for all you did for me.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, that's nothing. I act to please myself, and
bad things are more pleasant than good. You're
like that, too. The blood of our race runs in your
veins. You loved Captain Hawke with your whole
being, and yet you struck him a fatal blow.</q></p>

<p>It was too true. Bitterly had Edith Ross regretted
the mad fit of spite and revenge which had prompted
<pb n="118"/>
her to injure the man she loved—an injury which
could only be atoned by the exposure of her own
wickedness.</p>

<p><q>What's the fellow saying, Mrs Ross? If he's inso-
lent, I hope you'll tell me,</q> suddenly struck in Hilton.</p>

<p><q>Nothing, nothing,</q> she replied hurriedly. <q>He's
not rude. It's only his way of speaking.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> resumed Azimoolah, <q>it's true I've been
to England. If you don't believe me, bring me
face to face with the girl who was standing by your
side when we were brought in. She did not
recognise me in my disguise, but I knew her again.
She is very handsome—as handsome as you, Mrs
Ross—and younger. Would you like me to tell her
the story of Captain Hawke, and how he was ruined
by the woman who loved him?</q></p>

<p><q>Great heavens, no,</q> she cried, her agitation
overpowering her for a moment. <q>Azimoolah, you
shall be released. I'll say that I knew you years
ago, as an honest, respectable man.</q></p>

<p><q>Aha!</q> laughed the Mohammedan, <q>they think
I am a spy, and they are right. If <emph>you</emph> vouch for my
character they may let me go. But if I meet
Captain Hawke, what then?</q></p>

<p><q>There's not much fear of that if you're released
within twenty-four hours. He's in the hospital.
Remember, you must leave Lucknow at once.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I agree to that.</q></p>

<p><q>Then it's a compact?</q></p>

<p><q>I swear it—by Allah!</q></p>

<p><q>I've seen enough, Mr Hilton,</q> said she, turning
to the young officer. <q>Thank you very much.</q></p>

<p><q>That fellow had a tremendous jaw,</q> said Hilton,
a little discontentedly.</p>

<pb n="119"/>

<p>He had never seen Mrs Ross so animated; and
though it was absurd to be jealous of a prisoner—
a common water-carrier—something like the pangs
of jealousy shot through him.</p>

<p><q>Well, he interested me a little, because it turns
out my father used to employ him. Directly he
reminded me of two or three things, I recollected
him at once. He's a very respectable man, and
I can't understand his being suspected as a spy.
You must take me at once to Colonel Inglis.</q></p>

<p><q>At once?</q> faltered Hilton.</p>

<p><q>At once, please,</q> said Mrs Ross, peremptorily.
<q>Oh, you needn't be afraid of my getting you into
trouble.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't mind that a bit,</q> said the young man
gruffly. <q>If it is for your sake.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't talk nonsense! I suppose you want to
rise in your profession. I shall simply say I saw
the man as he was being taken to the Baillie Guard,
and recognised him.</q></p>

<p>All Mrs Ross's sweetness had disappeared. But
her influence over the ingenuous lad was not lessened.
She was taken to Colonel Inglis, and so impressed
him with the innocence of the supposed water-
carrier—whose name she did <emph>not</emph> say was Azimoolah
Khan—that the man, after being examined the next
day, was ordered to be released before sunset.</p>

<p>But she was in a fever of anxiety until this became
an accomplished fact. She ascertained that Azi-
moolah would be marched to the iron bridge across
the Gumti. Here she waited for and joined him
when the guard had crossed the bridge.</p>

<p><q>I've kept my word, Azimoolah. You owe me
something in return,</q> she whispered.</p>

<pb n="120"/>
<p><q>What shall it be?</q></p>

<p><q>You said you had met in England the girl who
was standing by my side when you were brought
into the city. Tell me her name.</q></p>

<p>No one was by, and they were talking in English,
which Azimoolah spoke with a perfect accent. He
smiled.</p>

<p><q>Jean Atherton,</q> said he.</p>

<p><q>How did you meet her? When and where was
it?</q> she cried excitedly.</p>

<p>Azimoolah explained.</p>

<p><q>And you can prove this?</q></p>

<p><q>I have letters in which her name is mentioned.</q></p>

<p><q>Let me have them. That's what I ask in return
for the service I've done you to-day.</q></p>

<p><q>I promise.</q></p>

<p><q>When?</q></p>

<p><q>Within two weeks.</q></p>

<p>He salaamed. Some people were approaching.
They parted.</p>

<div n="8" type="chapter">
<pb n="121"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="8">VIII</num></head>
<head type="main">In the Residency Garden</head>

<p>After her interview with Azimoolah Edith Ross
hurried back to the Residency. She had done a
daring thing in venturing out alone the distance of
nearly a mile. Rebellion was seething unseen in the
city, and the revolt of the military police the day
before was but an ebullition of the hidden ferment.
An upheaval was within measurable distance.</p>

<p>Edith Ross, like hundreds of other Anglo-Indians,
never thought of this. She lived in a state of false
security. The fact that Azimoolah Khan was in
Lucknow as a spy did not come upon her with any
significance. Spies had abounded in India from time
immemorial. They were indigenous to the soil.
What was one spy in Lucknow, more or less?</p>

<p>Had she disclosed to Colonel Inglis the identity of
this man, the horrors of Cawnpore might have been
averted. But she had not the gift of second sight,
neither did she know Azimoolah's real character.
She remembered him only as Jack Hawke's servant,
and as a man admirably adapted to carry out her
scheme of passionate revenge. She knew nothing of
his altered position, of his visit to England on behalf
of the Nana, of his being really the master spirit
of the mutiny, not only in Meerut but in Cawnpore.</p>

<p>How could she tell that his visit to Lucknow in
disguise was really to ascertain the state of affairs
<pb n="122"/>
there and to find out for himself whether Sir Henry
Lawrence was in a position to send assistance to Sir
Hugh Wheeler?</p>

<p>There is little doubt that Azimoolah's hand stirred
up the military police to revolt. When these men
went off to join the mutineers, Sir Henry became
convinced that he would have enough to do to hold
his own. The police fled on the 12th of June, and
on the 16th Sir Henry sent a letter to Sir Hugh
Wheeler in reply to the beleaguered general's earnest
appeals for help.</p>

<p><q>I am very sorry, indeed, to hear of your condition,</q>
wrote Sir Henry Lawrence, <q>and grieve that I cannot
help you. I have consulted with the chief officers
about me, and except Gubbins, they are unanimous
in thinking that, with the enemy's command of the
river, we could not possibly get a single man into
your entrenchments. I need not say that I deeply
lament being obliged to concur in this opinion, for
our safety is as nearly concerned as yours. We are
strong <emph>in</emph> our entrenchments, but to attempt the
passage of a river should be sacrificing a large
detachment without a prospect of helping you.</q></p>

<p>And without a doubt, Sir Henry was right. In all
probability Azimoolah satisfied himself that Sir
Henry was powerless to assist Sir Hugh Wheeler.
What he saw in Lucknow determined him to hurry
on with the bombardment of the Cawnpore
entrenchments. There could be but one end to the
siege.</p>

<p>Edith Ross went back to the Residency like one
who had been relieved of the burden of a millstone.
Of all contingencies, the last she reckoned upon was
meeting with Azimoolah. But she was now safe
<pb n="123"/>
and free to further her scheme as to Dr Lennard and
Jean.</p>

<p><q>I've no ill-will against the girl,</q> she comforted
herself by saying, <q>unless she comes in my path. If
she does she'll have no mercy from me. It may be,</q>
she added and her eyes shone with a light not often
seen in them, it almost suggested tenderness—<q>if
Jack is once convinced he can't get her, he'll turn to
me. Time was when he would do anything I asked.
But in those days I had a dozen men at my feet, and
Jack was no more to me than any of the others. So
I used to think then—I know differently now.</q></p>

<p>Hawke was only detained in the hospital two days,
in one way far too long for his impatient spirit.
But after the first day there was no inducement to
remain, for Dr Macpherson ordered Jean to another
patient. <q>Ye ken enough about cold bandages, lassie,</q>
said he grimly. When she was gone the place became
hateful to Hawke. Macpherson released him with
some misgiving.</p>

<p><q>That sunstroke has done ye nae good, my lad,</q>
said the old doctor to himself, with a shake of his
head.</p>

<p>A week passed away, and no change took place.
The city was quiet, but Sir Henry Lawrence never
relaxed his efforts towards strengthening the Resi-
dency. He knew this was destined to be his strong-
hold.</p>

<p>The Residency with its adjacent buildings was to
the west of the city, and not quite a quarter of a mile
south of the river Gumti. The iron bridge was well
within half-a-mile of its western extremity, the stone
bridge was a little more than three-quarters of a mile
still farther west. These were the only bridges the
<pb n="124"/>
city possessed. They led to the British cantonments,
to the north side of the river, where the first signs of
the mutiny were seen.</p>

<p>The entrenchments surrounding the main buildings
were in the form of an irregular pentagon. Many
houses were within these entrenchments, and all
were carefully loopholed in every direction. Where
there were exposed verandahs overlooking the exterior
wall towards the street, these verandahs were walled
up with mud from two to three feet thick. Thus
they were protected from any attempt at storming.</p>

<p>In some cases, where it was practicable, a sort of
scaffolding was built upon the roof, so as to enable
the defenders to fire from a more elevated position.
Other roofs were surrounded by low earth walls
covered with sandbags.</p>

<p>Mr Martin Gubbins, the commissioner, a man of
wonderful energy, was untiring. He erected at his
own expense a half-moon battery, mounting a nine-
pounder, which could play on three different points.
Another house was defended by a deep ditch and a
cactus hedge, and fortified by a couple of guns.</p>

<p>The church, a gothic building, with twenty low
pinnacles, was converted into a storehouse for grain.
At the gate to the east was a mortar battery,
destined to shell the whole of the western and
northern buildings outside the entrenchments as far
as the iron and stone bridges.</p>

<p>The victims of the outbreak in the cantonments
were the first who were buried in the church. It had
not before been used as a place of interment. It
was soon destined to be filled with the bodies of
the gallant defenders of the Lucknow garrison.</p>

<p>The strongest piece of fortification work was the
<pb n="125"/>
redan, erected by Captain Fulton, an engineer of
great capacity. The whole of the riverside and the
buildings on the opposite banks could be played
upon by the cannon Fulton planted here. In the
event of an attack both the north and east, as well
as the west sides, could be swept with grape from
the redan.</p>

<p>Along the redan, to the north, in an irregular line
extending to the hospital, was a wall of fascines and
of earthwork, above which and through whose loop-
holes formed by sandbags the men were able to fire
with certain effect. The Baillie Guard was in an
isolated position, and practically outside the bound-
aries of the Residency entrenchments.</p>

<p>The Baillie Guard Gate to the right was lofty, and
a fine piece of architecture. The gate was to be
blocked up with earth, and in the event of an
entrance being forced, two nine-pounders and an eight-
inch howitzer could between them shower grape and
canister upon the assailants.</p>

<p>The post-office was one of the most important
positions. It commanded a large area in different
directions. It was made the barrack-room of a great
portion of the soldiers. It was besides the head-
quarters of the engineers, and offered accommodation
to several families.</p>

<p>There were also other buildings, some of them
inside the boundaries, and others on the borders, and
used as outposts. Here many of the most stubborn
fights occurred, and hundreds of sepoys paid for their
temerity with their lives. Through the enclosed
space ran various roads and lanes, most of them very
narrow, and all destined to be scenes of fierce
combat.</p>

<pb n="126"/>
<p>Sir Henry Lawrence's quarters were in the Resi-
dency itself, in a room convenient from its elevated
position for observing the enemy, but unduly exposed.
Had he regarded his own safety, he would have
chosen any room but this.</p>

<p>As the days went on the feeling of disquietude
which was always present in a greater or less degree
deepened. No news had come from Cawnpore, and
upon Cawnpore everything depended.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Lawrence, writing to Lord Canning on
the 23rd of June, said: <q>If Cawnpore holds out, I
doubt if we shall be besieged at all.</q></p>

<p>But five days later came the terrible news. Cawn-
pore had fallen, and its brave garrison had been
butchered.</p>

<p>A thrill of horror went through the little commun-
ity. Never before had the savagery of the mutiny
seemed so real to them. Never had it touched them
so nearly. Cawnpore was not so many miles from
Lucknow. Until the mutineers closed the roads,
communication between the two places was ready
and frequent. Members of the same families were
in both, and the friendships were many.</p>

<p>Yet, amid the thousand and one rumours which
spread with lightning rapidity, in spite of the appre-
hensions as to the approach of danger, love, hatred,
jealousy, revenge, went on apace. The moment for
the merging of purely personal feelings into one
common emotion had not arrived.</p>

<p>Jack Hawke's fierce unreasoning love for Jean
became more intense day by day. For all that he
was careful to avoid her. He busied himself in work
which took him to a distant part of the Residency
and only saw her at a distance.</p>

<pb n="127"/>
<p>Edith Ross was not deceived by this apparent
indifference. She knew Hawke thoroughly. He
was a man who could by a strong effort of will
abstain from anything towards which his passions or
inclinations led him; but the self-imposed barrier
once broken, he knew no bounds. It was so with
gambling, so with betting, and so with drinking.</p>

<p><q>I shall leave Jack alone for a while,</q> said Mrs
Ross to herself. <q>I gain nothing by irritating him.
Why doesn't Ernest Lennard make the running with
Jean now he has the chance? I hate your scientific
men. They're so slow in making up their minds.
They must be sure of everything before they stir
a step.</q></p>

<p>This was not quite true of Lennard. He <emph>had</emph> made
up his mind that he loved Jean Atherton. The doubt
was what her answer would be if he declared himself.</p>

<p>Mrs Ross never lost an opportunity of dropping
hints to Lennard as to what she pretended she knew
about Jean's feelings towards him. Jean herself
always appeared pleased when he approached her,
and her father was certainly in his favour. Mr
Atherton was both a shrewd and blunt man and he
never beat about the bush.</p>

<p><q>You needn't be unnecessarily reticent about the
matter, Lennard,</q> said he with a smile. <q>I've seen for
some time past how your thoughts have been tend-
ing. Let me say at once there is no man to whom
I would more gladly see my dear girl married than
yourself.</q></p>

<p><q>How good of you to say that,</q> cried Lennard, his
pale face flushing. <q>I admit that I admire—well,
admire is too cold a word—let me say plainly that I
love Jean; but——</q></p>

<pb n="128"/>
<p><q>Well, where does the <q>but</q> come in?</q> said
Mr Atherton, seeing that he hesitated.</p>

<p><q>I fear she doesn't care sufficiently for me. There
may be some prior attachment—somebody in Eng-
land perhaps.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't you worry, doctor. It wouldn't amount to
more than a mere flirtation—a boy and girl affair.
Girls of her age are not in the same mood two weeks
together. Besides the present lover has always the
advantage over the absent one. It's his own fault if
he doesn't make full use of his opportunity. And
especially now, Lennard,</q> continued Atherton, his
voice suddenly becoming very grave. <q>We're on the
eve of a terrible crisis. Do you know what news Sir
Henry received this morning?</q></p>

<p><q>No; I've been in the hospital all day, and have
heard nothing.</q></p>

<p><q>The rebels are massing from all quarters at
Nawabgunge, only twenty miles away. This morning
a spy came into the Residency with the intelligence
that an advance guard of 500 infantry and 100 horse
had arrived at Chinhut on the Fyzabad road, to
collect supplies for a main body, who are to follow.
Chinhut, as you know, is but eight miles away.
Twenty of our cavalry—the best we could muster,
and that isn't saying very much—went out at once to
reconnoitre, but were unable to do so. The cunning
rascals posted pickets, and these were in too strong
a force to allow our men to pass. They came back
without learning anything.</q></p>

<p><q>What's going to be done?</q> returned Lennard,
with an anxious face.</p>

<p><q>Sir Henry will attack the enemy in force to-
morrow morning. He hopes to smash up the advance
<pb n="129"/>
guard before the reinforcements reach it. I'm very
doubtful as to the result. The fall of Cawnpore has
released a few thousands of the devils, and my opinion
is that the enemy is much stronger than Sir Henry
imagines. It will be an awful business if we're
defeated. You may depend upon it, the Residency
will be at once attacked, and well, it may be Cawnpore
over again.</q></p>

<p>Atherton paused a moment and went on in lower
and more earnest tones.</p>

<p><q>Lennard, this is a queer time, isn't it, to talk of
marriage and giving in marriage, and what I'm going
to say is for your sake and for the sake of my
daughter whom I dearly love. At any moment I may
be taken away—there are no non-combatants now;
even you surgeons may have to fight, though heaven
knows you'll have plenty of work in the hospital—and
it would be some slight comfort to me in my final
hour to know that my girl had a husband who would
guard her to the last drop of his blood.</q></p>

<p><q>By heaven, Atherton, you speak the truth there,</q>
cried Lennard, his eyes flashing.</p>

<p><q>Very well. Then lose no time. You know my
ideas. I leave the rest to you. Go at once to
Jean.</q></p>

<p>Lennard went out in a tumult of feeling. He
would not give himself time to think. It was not a
moment for doubts, subtleties of thought and analysis
of emotions. One lurking suspicion had indeed been
removed, at least so he thought. Jean, while pitying
Hawke, did not love him. So much he had learned
in his conversations with her. Nor had Hawke forced
himself in any way upon her.</p>

<p>With hope thrilling in every nerve, he hastened
<pb n="130"/>
towards the quarter of the building which had been
assigned to the ladies.</p>

<p>As a doctor here, there, and everywhere, at every-
body's beck and call, Lennard was known by sight to
every lady in the Residency and to a large number
by professional service; and there were few indeed
among the children who did not know him and
look upon him with that reverence and awe with
which children commonly regard men in his profession.
He had therefore no difficulty in finding a messenger
to carry a note to Jean, to ask her for an early inter-
view. When he reached the ladies' quarters, he
commandeered a sometime patient of nine or ten
years of age to carry his note to Miss Atherton and
to bring him her reply. The girl, glad to do the doctor
a service and pleased to win a smile from Jean, whom
everybody loved, carried the note to her and delivered
it with more exactness than necessary, saying that she
had brought it from the doctor, who waited her
reply.</p>

<p>Several ladies heard the child's remarks as she
delivered the note, and one of them, whose eyes lit up
with an unusual interest, rose and left the room. As
the child returned with Jean's answer, she met the
lady, who induced the child to let her look at the
scribbled note she carried, from which Mrs Ross
learned that Jean Atherton had promised to meet
Ernest Lennard by the fountain in the Residency
garden in a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Having secured this important secret, she hastened
with all speed to make the best possible use of it for
her own purposes, and immediately set out for the
redan.</p>

<p>Here she knew she would find Hawke. She met
<pb n="131"/>
him half way. He was leading a horse, and he
scarcely noticed her. She went up to him.</p>

<p><q>Jack!</q> said she.</p>

<p>He turned abruptly.</p>

<p><q>Don't hinder me. I'm in a hurry.</q></p>

<p><q>You've need to be,</q> she replied with emphasis,
<q>if you don't want to lose Jean Atherton.</q></p>

<p><q>What do you mean?</q> he asked fiercely.</p>

<p><q>I suppose you thought you were the only man
likely to take her girlish fancy, and that you'd but
to look at her and she would wait your highness's
pleasure. That's how it used to be in the old days.
You haven't altered much, Jack, but circumstances
have—worse luck for you.</q></p>

<p>He seized her wrist, twisted her round, and glared
into her face.</p>

<p><q>You haven't sought me without a motive. You
never do anything without a motive. What is it
now?</q></p>

<p>Edith Ross knew Jack Hawke well. He was a
man who required a strong stimulant before his
nature was roused.</p>

<p><q>How dull you are! Can't you understand that
a man at this very moment is making love to Jean
Atherton? But perhaps you don't care sufficiently
about her for this to affect you.</q></p>

<p>He started. The blood surged to his face. He
allowed the rope attached to the horse's head to
drop from his hand.</p>

<p>Hitherto Hawke had been living in a delicious
day-dream. He had got it into his head that Jean
was perfectly free, and he resolved to wait his time.
The stigma attached to his name was the stumbling-
block. He knew the difficulty of explaining away
<pb n="132"/>
his past. Even if he could do so, it meant going
into so deep a confession of folly, that he shrank
from the task. What an older woman would readily
understand and condone, a young girl would look
upon with repugnance.</p>

<p>He longed to do some daring deed, some
stupendous feat of heroism which would blot out
all that he had done in the past and all that was
said against him in the present. Then, when all
would be glad to shake him by the hand, he would
go boldly to Jean and ask her for her love.</p>

<p>This was his dream. Mrs Ross had rudely shaken
him out of it. The possibility of another man
carrying Jean off before his eyes had never occurred
to him. It roused every drop of hot blood in his
body.</p>

<p><q>Have you anything else to say?</q> he cried
hoarsely.</p>

<p><q>I see you don't believe me,</q> said Mrs Ross.
<q>It's easy to satisfy you that I speak the truth.
Come with me.</q></p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment. Edith Ross watched
his heavy brows lowering, and his lips tightening till
they were almost white. She knew she had gained
the day.</p>

<p><q>Where?</q></p>

<p><q>In the Residency garden, near the fountain.</q></p>

<p>He wrenched his horse's head round with a force
which must have hurt the animal's mouth, tied him
to a palisading, and with a look of midnight on his
handsome face, followed the temptress.</p>

<p>The Residency garden, once so trim and gay, was
now a scene of disorder. Stores in boxes, barrels
and bags were heaped upon the flower-beds; shot
<pb n="133"/>
were piled up on the lawn; bullock carts, tumbrils,
artillery waggons crowded the paths. Only the few
flowers near the fountain beneath a large tree had
been spared. In some places the stores had been
so heaped up in sections that going through the
narrow gangways was like threading a maze.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, and they could easily ap-
proach the fountain without being seen by the two
who were already there.</p>

<p><q>Come nearer,</q> whispered Edith Ross, <q>you can
hear what they are saying.</q></p>

<p><q>Who's the fellow?</q> was Hawke's fierce answer.</p>

<p><q>Don't you know? Ernest Lennard!</q></p>

<p>His friend! The man who had stuck to him
through evil report, who had defended him when all
seemed black.</p>

<p><q>I'll not go a step farther,</q> he muttered in a
choking voice. <q>Lennard, at least, is worthy of her
—more worthy than I am. Why did you bring me
here, Edith?</q></p>

<p>A gleam of triumph lit up the woman's dark eyes.
It was the first time he had called her Edith since
his return to Lucknow. Was this a sign of her
returning power?</p>

<p>He was destined to hear, whether he would or
not.</p>

<p>The two figures who had been talking so earnestly,
moved from the fountain, and came slowly in
Hawke's direction. To move would mean discovery.
Mrs Ross's fingers closed swiftly round his arm, as
a sign for him to remain quiet.</p>

<p>Lennard did not look like a man who had proposed
and had been accepted. He was very pale. There
was no joy in his eyes. Jean was walking by his
<pb n="134"/>
side, not close to him, as she would have been had
things gone smoothly. Her eyes were bent on the
ground. Her lips seemed to tremble. Neither
spoke.</p>

<p><q>You'll forgive me, Dr Lennard, won't you?</q> at
last they heard her say, and she spoke with evident
effort.</p>

<p><q>What have I to forgive, Miss Atherton? I
staked and lost, that's all. Many men have done
the same thing,</q> was his answer. And he drew a
long breath.</p>

<p><q>I'm so sorry,</q> she went on pityingly. <q>I—I do
like you very much; but you see how it is, don't
you?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, yes, say no more. I'm glad you've told me.
It's better always to find out the truth. It's saved
me much future pain, because had I not known
what I now know I might have come to love you
so much that——</q> Then he checked himself, and
cried:</p>

<p><q>What's the good speculating as to what might
be? I've done too much already of that, I'm afraid.</q></p>

<p><q>But we shall still be friends?</q> she urged.</p>

<p>The vibration of feeling in his voice had brought
tears to her eyes. She knew that her refusal had in-
flicted the sharpest pain a man can feel, and it went
to her heart to tell him she could never become his
wife.</p>

<p><q>I hope so. What has happened can make no
difference in my regard for you. May I see you to
the Residency?</q></p>

<p>She bowed her head, and slipped her little hand
within his arm as a token he had not offended her.
They went slowly off together.</p>

<pb n="135"/>
<p>The man and woman left behind exchanged a
glance. The eyes of the former had in them a
savage joy. The eyes of the latter were dull with
disappointment and baffled spite.</p>

<p><q>I never thought to thank you for bringing me
here,</q> he exclaimed, <q>but I do. Poor beggar! How
nicely and considerately she refused him! Perhaps
you'll say she'll refuse me when my turn comes to
ask her.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> said Mrs Ross, in a voice trembling with
suppressed passion. <q>Fool that you are, Jack
Hawke! Can't you read between the lines? Didn't
you hear sufficient to tell you that the girl refused
him, not because she could not love him, but because
she loved someone else better? Are you the one she
loves?</q></p>

<p><q>Why not?</q> returned Hawke. But his tone was
not confident.</p>

<p><q>Shall I find out for you? Nothing is easier.
Take my advice, Jack Hawke. Think no more of
Jean Atherton. You're not the man to take punish-
ment in Dr Lennard's fashion.</q></p>

<p><q>That's my affair.</q></p>

<p>And with a reckless laugh and at tug at his
moustache, he strode off.</p>

<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="9">IX</num></head>
<head type="main">The Fatal Day of Chinhut</head>

<p>Hawke returned to his horse with a strange sense
of exhilaration. He knew that Ernest Lennard had
proposed to Jean Atherton and had been rejected.
He cared to know nothing more.</p>

<p>He was going into battle with a light heart. It
was the 29th of June. Sir Henry Lawrence's spies
had brought word that the main body of the enemy
would not reach Chinhut until the evening of the
30th; and Sir Henry had resolved to strike a decisive
blow before the reinforcements arrived.</p>

<p>His determination was known only to the military
officers. Mr Gubbins, the financial commissioner,
between whom and Sir Henry there was a slight
estrangement, was not aware of what was contem-
plated.</p>

<p>Hawke, among others, had received his orders;
and, as he was not attached to any particular regiment,
he joined the Volunteer Cavalry under Captain
Radcliff. When Mrs Ross met him he was in the act
of leading a horse to the stables to fit him with a
saddle and put him in readiness for the expedition.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the whole of the British force yet re-
maining in the cantonments north of the river
Gumti were ordered to move within the Residency,
and from these Sir Henry made his selection. The
little army was composed of 300 men of the 32nd
<pb n="137"/>
regiment; 230 men of the Native Infantry; a small
troop of Volunteer Cavalry, 36 strong; 120 troopers
of the Oudh Irregulars, ten guns, and an eight-inch
howitzer.</p>

<p>To this eight-inch howitzer a fatal interest is
attached. All that need be said about it now is that
it was discovered in a Lucknow house when a search
was made for arms immediately after the outbreak
on 30th May. Of the ten guns just mentioned, six
were manned by natives, and four only by Europeans.
The howitzer was on a limber or gun-carriage drawn
by an elephant. Had it been left behind the greatest
calamity of the siege might have been prevented.</p>

<p>The order was that the force should assemble at
the iron bridge at daylight on the morning of the 30th.
But there was unavoidable delay, and it was nearly
six o'clock when some of the ladies in the Residency
were awakened by the tramp of men and horse, the
jingle of accoutrements, the rumble of the gun-
carriages, and the shouts of the native drivers.</p>

<p>Jean was one of the first to be aroused. She had
not slept well. Dr Lennard's proposal had troubled
her.</p>

<p>Directly she awoke and heard the noise she ran to
the window. Another lady, the wife of a dis-
tinguished officer, was already there.</p>

<p><q>What is the matter, Mrs Trafford?</q> she asked
anxiously.</p>

<p><q>I can't tell you. I haven't seen my husband
since nine o'clock last night. I hope it doesn't
mean they are going out to meet the rebels. My
dear, I have had a terrible dream within the last few
hours.</q></p>

<p>The lady shuddered and drew closer to Jean, as
<pb n="138"/>
though the mere remembrance made her instinctively
seek protection.</p>

<p><q>You don't believe in dreams, Mrs Trafford, do
you?</q> said Jean.</p>

<p><q>Of course not, but—oh, one never knows. I
dreamt that our men went out just as you see them
doing now, and that we were defeated. Ah, there's
my husband! I wish he were not going.</q></p>

<p>At that moment Major Trafford of the 32nd rode
by, and he raised his cap to his wife and to Jean.
The latter scarcely saw him, for immediately after
the 32nd came the Volunteer Cavalry and among the
latter was Hawke. He glanced upwards at the
Residency windows, and a triumphant smile irradi-
ated his face when he recognised Jean. He, too,
raised his cap—with a bold, masterful air Jean had
never seen in him before.</p>

<p>It was, of course, quite an accident which led Jean
to be at the window, and she never anticipated
seeing Hawke. He went away with his impressions
as to Jean's feelings towards him confirmed.</p>

<p><q>She loves me!</q> he muttered. <q>She loves me!</q></p>

<p>No man set out for the fateful field of Chinhut
that morning with a lighter heart than did Jack
Hawke. He was in the humour to meet the enemy.</p>

<p>Sir Henry's information led him to believe that
the rebel force assembled at Chinhut, but eight miles
from Lucknow on the Fyzabad road, intended to
march to Lucknow early on the morning of the 30th.
He started, in the hope of meeting the enemy at a
disadvantage, either at the entrance into the suburbs
of the city or at the bridge across the Kookrail—a
small stream intersecting the Fyzabad road midway
between Chinhut and Lucknow.</p>

<pb n="139"/>
<p>Up to the river the road was metalled and in good
order. Beyond was a newly-raised embankment
constructed of loose and sandy soil, in which every
now and then gaps occurred indicating the position
of projected bridges.</p>

<p>At the bridge over the Kookrail the force halted,
and here Sir Henry proposed to await the coming of
the enemy.</p>

<p>All in front was clear, so far as could be seen.
The rebels, apparently, had altered their mind.</p>

<p><q>We're on a fool's errand!</q> grumbled Hawke.
<q>Look here, some of the fellows have got orders to
return.</q></p>

<p><q>Wait a moment,</q> said a man at Hawke's side.
<q>I don't think so. Sir Henry has one or two men
with him who are not the fellows to go back without
a blow at the enemy.</q></p>

<p><q>Anyhow, there's the assistant adjutant-general
speaking to Major Trafford, and to my mind it looks
like a march back.</q></p>

<p>Hawke was partly right and partly wrong.</p>

<p>The assistant adjutant-general had indeed arrived
with orders from Sir Henry for the force to return to
Lucknow, but other opinions were at work. Sir
Henry, allowing himself to be persuaded against his
own judgment, countermanded the order to return.
The little army crossed the bridge, and entered upon
the irregular ground and the loose soil.</p>

<p><q>Where's the commissariat?</q> growled a private of
the 32nd. <q>We've 'ad the sun shining full in our faces
for the last two hours, and I'm as dry as a limekiln.</q></p>

<p><q>Ay,</q> said his right-hand comrade. <q>There's
plenty of rum and biscuits, for I saw 'em packed,
and there's the river to mix wi' the rum.</q></p>

<pb n="140"/>
<p>All this was perfectly true. But by an oversight
due probably to the uncertainty of opinion whether
to advance or retreat, nothing was served out.</p>

<p>The little army advanced in regular order. An
advance guard of cavalry, with vedettes thrown out,
led. This was followed, first, by the eight-inch
howitzer, then by four guns manned by natives. A
hundred and fifty men of the 13th Native Infantry
came next, with two guns manned by natives. The
rear was brought up by 300 men of the 32nd Foot
and the remaining native troops, 80 in number.</p>

<p>No enemy was seen. In view of what happened
afterwards it is clear that the messengers who
brought information to Sir Henry grossly deceived
him. The British force marched on slowly till a
long line of mango-groves came in sight. Suddenly,
when the advance guard was about a thousand yards
from this grove, a heavy artillery fire burst from
among the trees.</p>

<p>Instantly the advancing column deployed into line.
The guns were run forward and opened fire; the
infantry threw themselves on the ground, and the
shot went harmlessly over their heads. The battle,
thus opened with a duel of artillery, seemed to lead
to nothing. Our officers were congratulating them-
selves on an easy victory when all at once, on each
side, a vast host of sepoys were seen, threatening
the British force on both flanks.</p>

<p>The bitter truth was made evident. Instead of
having to engage barely a thousand men, no less
than seven thousand were opposed to comparatively
a handful of British troops.</p>

<p>Chinhut itself was a large village, situated on a
plain on the very banks of a very extensive <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">jheel</foreign> or
<pb n="141"/>
lake. The camp of the enemy lay to the left of
Chinhut; the village of Ishmaelgunge, where the
action was really fought, to the left of the road by
which the British were advancing.</p>

<p>The masses of rebel cavalry, infantry and artillery
were seen advancing to the right and left. The
British commander was by no means dismayed, and
the howitzer and the musketry fire of the infantry
held the enemy in check for some time.</p>

<p>Then came an unexpected disaster. Treachery
was at work. One of the guns served by the native
artillerymen was suddenly drawn to the side of the
road.</p>

<p>The officer in command ran up in a passion, and
demanded to know what the rascals were doing.
The answer was given by a gunner, whose sword was
uplifted and came down with a slash on one of the
horses attached to the guns. The wounded animal
sprang in the air, and the next moment the gun was
overturned in the ditch. The rest of the men cut
the traces and fled for their lives. A terrible scene
of confusion ensued.</p>

<p>The men belonging to the remaining three guns
followed the example of their traitorous comrades.
They were deaf to all remonstrances. Sir Henry's
staff rode up, headed by the brigadier-general,
who drew his sword upon the rascals; but all in
vain.</p>

<p>At the critical moment a terrible fire opened from
the village of Ishmaelgunge, running parallel to that
part of our line occupied by the 32nd.</p>

<p>The fire from this village caught the regiment
in flank, and in a very few minutes nearly half of
the little force with a large proportion of its officers,
<pb n="142"/>
including the commanding officer, Colonel Case,
were lying dead or disabled on the ground.</p>

<p>The attack paralysed the 32nd. Deprived of
their officers, the men threw themselves down in the
shelter of a small undulation, firing at the enemy as
fast as they could.</p>

<p>In the face of the overwhelming numbers surround-
ing the little army, there was but one thing to do—
retreat. The order was given. The march back
began under circumstances to which it would be
difficult to find a parallel.</p>

<p>Ill-luck dogged the footsteps of the British that
terrible day. The howitzer, to which reference has
already been made, was doomed to work out its
sinister destiny. The elephant which was to have
carried it was half maddened by the fire. While the
gunners were striving to attach the ponderous beast
to its carriage, a bullet <choice><corr>struck</corr><orig>struct</orig></choice> the lieutenant in charge,
and the howitzer had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Within forty-eight hours it was in action again,
but alas, not on our side. It fell into the hands of
the enemy, and from it, as will be seen later on, was
fired the shot which killed the bravest and wisest
of the many gallant leaders who gave their lives for
their country and Queen in those terrible times.</p>

<p>The retreat had become general, when Captain
Bassano, of the 32nd Foot, who had been searching
for Colonel Case, discovered the gallant officer lying
wounded. He offered to bring some of the men
back to carry him away.</p>

<p><q>Leave me to die here,</q> the brave fellow gasped.
<q>I've no need of assistance. Your place is at the
head of your company.</q></p>

<p>Colonel Case was last seen lying on the roadside,
<pb n="143"/>
with his eyes wide open, and his sword firmly
grasped, in the midst of his companions in arms.</p>

<p>The enemy, by this time in rapid pursuit, were
one moving mass of men. Like locusts they
swarmed steadily towards the British force; the
light puffs of smoke floating from every ravine and
bunch of grass were followed by the spattering of
showers of bullets.</p>

<p>As a rule the rebels showed little discipline in
their fighting, but that day was an exception. They
came on as steadily as possible. A field day on
parade could not have shown better order. Their
strength was in their numbers. There was no need
to hurry; they knew that the tiny force in front of
them was without supports.</p>

<p>Despite their terrible condition, the British never
drifted into confusion. Many of the sepoys who
remained faithful performed acts of noble self-
sacrifice, some carrying their wounded officers on
their backs for very long distances. But for this,
scores of British soldiers must have died of their
injuries, for there were no <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dhoolies</foreign> (litters) for the
wounded. At the very beginning of the action
several of the bearers were killed. The rest were
instantly seized with panic and fled.</p>

<p>The water-carriers also decamped. The European
infantry were so exhausted by thirst and fatigue that
they could scarcely drag themselves along, and only
did so by the aid of the cavalry volunteers, each
one of whom was encumbered by two, three, and even
four foot-soldiers holding on by the hand of the
horseman, or by his stirrup, or by the crupper or tail
of his horse.</p>

<p>To add to the list of misfortunes, many of the
<pb n="144"/>
muskets belonging to the men of the 32nd were
useless. They had been kept loaded long without
having been discharged, and had become foul.</p>

<p>During the retreat an officer shouted to a private
by name, and ordered him to turn round and fire
upon the enemy.</p>

<p><q>I'll do so if you wish,</q> growled the man, <q>but
what's the good? I've already snapped six caps and
the piece won't go off.</q></p>

<p>At last the dispirited and sorely harassed men
reached the Kookrail bridge, and here they were
face to face with a new disaster.</p>

<p>The road in front was seen to be occupied by
a dense mass of rebel cavalry, who had worked their
way round unseen. Annihilation seemed inevitable.
Sir Henry never wavered. He ordered the guns to
be unlimbered, and they were pointed in readiness
to be loaded with grape, when an officer rushed up
to Sir Henry in great agitation.</p>

<p><q>What are we to do, Sir Henry? We've no
ammunition.</q></p>

<p><q>Never mind. Light the port fires all the same.</q></p>

<p>The chief's nerve and decision warded off rout
and slaughter. The enemy believed the guns were
loaded and shrank back. They had not the pluck
to attempt to charge at a bridge defended by
cannon.</p>

<p><q>Now's our time to show what we're made of,</q>
muttered Hawke to his next man. <q>Why doesn't
Radcliff order us to charge?</q></p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth before
Radcliff's stentorian voice roared out, <q>Threes right.
Trot.</q> The gallant little troop swept out of the
trees at the side of the road, taking no heed of two
<pb n="145"/>
nine-pounders which immediately opened fire upon
them.</p>

<p><q>Charge,</q> shouted Radcliff. The trumpet sounded
and the volunteers, of whom some had never seen
fighting before, hurled themselves at the advancing
native cavalry. Thirty-five against five hundred,
to say nothing of the guns! The five hundred never
waited for the shock. The plucky thirty-five sabring
all within reach, wheeled round and galloped
to the rear of the slowly moving columns. The
bridge was clear for the infantry and the wounded
to cross.</p>

<p>But the enemy was by no means driven off. They
harassed the retreating force right up to the iron
bridge across the Gumti leading to the Residency.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary thing in this cavalry fight
was that the enemy's horse was apparently com-
manded by a European, who was seen waving his
sword, and attempting to make his men follow him
to the charge. He was a handsome-looking man,
well-built, fair, about twenty-five years of age
wearing the undress uniform of a European cavalry
officer, with a blue and gold laced cap on his head.</p>

<p>In vain our men tried to get at him. When he
saw that his troopers would not stand attack, he
galloped off, and was not seen again. Everyone
looked upon the incident as most mysterious, and
many were the speculations as to who he could be.
The mystery could not be solved. The man was
believed to be a Russian, but the fact was never
made clear.</p>

<p>Of all the men who took part in this unfortunate
affair, Sir Henry Lawrence was the most active and
untiring. He was seen in the most exposed parts
<pb n="146"/>
of the field riding about, giving directions, or speak-
ing words of encouragement, amidst a terrific fire
of grape, roundshot and musketry, which struck
down men on every side.</p>

<p>Forgetful of himself, conscious only of the danger
and distress of the troops, at the moment of the
crisis near the Kookrail bridge, when his little
force appeared about to be overwhelmed by the dead
weight of opposing numbers, he wrung his hands
In agony, and exclaimed:</p>

<p><q>My God—my God—and I brought them to
this.</q></p>

<p>And yet he had no cause to reproach himself.
The retreat of the exhausted force from the Kook-
rail bridge to Lucknow, under the circumstances
of the case, is one of the most marvellous incidents
in the whole history of the Mutiny.</p>

<p>After passing the bridge Sir Henry gave over the
command to Colonel Inglis, and, attended only by
his secretary and staff officer, galloped to Lucknow,
and through the city to the Residency. He knew
what would follow the defeat at Chinhut, and he
lost not a moment in making his preparations.</p>

<p>In the meantime the news of the disaster had
reached the city as early as 9 A.M. A number of the
Sikh cavalry and mounted artillerymen crossed the
iron bridge at that hour, their horses flecked with
foam, and themselves in mortal terror. But not one
of them was wounded.</p>

<p><q>Why did you run?</q> angrily cried the commis-
sioner to whom they presented themselves.</p>

<p><q>Ah, sahib, we were surrounded,</q> was the only
answer they could give. Half-an-hour later a
messenger who had been sent to gain information,
<pb n="147"/>
returned to Lucknow bearing Sir Henry's sword
scabbard and a message that he was unhurt.</p>

<p>Shortly after the troops began to arrive—a sad
procession of wounded and half prostrate men
crawling along as best they could, without order or
formation. Weak as they were, none of the natives
of the city attempted to molest them. On the
contrary, on approaching the suburbs, the natives—
men, women and children, rich and poor—crowded
round the weary and wounded fugitives, bringing
water.</p>

<p>Had it not been for Sir Henry's forethought, fearful
carnage might have taken place on the iron bridge
leading to the city. But on his arrival at the Resi-
dency he ordered out fifty men of the 32nd, under
Lieutenant Edmonstone, to the bridge, and posted
them in two houses on each side. Towards this
bridge the yelling and triumphant enemy rushed;
but here they stopped. They never attempted to
cross it. These fifty Englishmen, supported by the
fire from the two eighteen-pounders in the redan
battery, held the bridge successfully till noon. The
rebels then gave up the attempt and moved off
towards the stone bridge farther up the river.</p>

<p>So ended the disastrous affair at Chinhut. The
number of killed in comparison to the wounded was
enormous. Out of a force of not 300 men, 112
British officers and soldiers were killed, and 44
wounded. Of the natives, there were nearly 300
killed and missing. Only 11 wounded returned
to the city. Besides the howitzer three field-pieces
were lost, with almost all the ammunition waggons
of the native guns.</p>

<p>No estimate could be formed of the loss of the
<pb n="148"/>
enemy, but the total number engaged was calculated
at 5550 infantry, 800 cavalry and 100 artillery.
The odds were fearful, and the only cause for wonder
is not that so many of the British should have
perished, but that any number should have escaped.</p>

<p>It was a terrible ordeal for the women, who, crowd-
ing to the Residency windows, saw the poor fellows
staggering in at the Baillie Guard Gate. But there
was no time for sentiment. The wounded had to
be cared for, and one by one they were taken to the
hospital, formerly the banqueting hall.</p>

<p>Jean was one of the first to offer her services. She
had in imagination nerved herself for the terrors of
the scene, but the reality far surpassed all she could
conceive. After an hour or so Dr Macpherson sent
her back. She was sick and faint.</p>

<p>Suddenly a fierce yell of triumph issued from a
square building some little distance outside the
Baillie Guard Gate. A lady burst into the room
where Jean was, pale and agitated.</p>

<p><q>The prisoners in the gaol have broken loose,</q> she
screamed.</p>

<p>This was of comparatively little importance then.
The prisoners were not fighters. They would not
attempt to enter the Residency. They would go
where plunder was to be had.</p>

<p>While the terrified ladies were watching the crowd
of prisoners creeping, some lowering themselves out
of the windows, others, out of sheer insolent bravado,
climbing to the roof and shouting out abuse of their
former masters, a flash of light was seen in the dis-
tance.</p>

<p><q>What's that?</q> whispered Jean, trembling in spite
of her efforts to control herself.</p>

<pb n="149"/>
<p>The next moment she heard the sound of crashing
masonry and bricks. A roundshot had struck the
corner of the Residency. It came from the first gun
fired by the rebels in the city.</p>

<p>The siege of Lucknow had begun.</p>

</div>

<head type="main">The First Day of the Siege</head>

<p>The siege of Lucknow was maintained with extra-
ordinary energy. The rebels were no doubt sanguine
of success. They knew that their numbers were
overwhelming, and that the British were not only
isolated but beyond the reach of help.</p>

<p>The mutineers had not the pluck to cross the
Gumti by the iron and stone bridges, the guns of the
redan battery commanding the first, and those of
the Mutcheebhawun the second; but numbers of the
cavalry entered the city by fording the river lower
down, out of the range of fire and many of the
infantry followed. Guns were brought over, while
cannon was very soon placed in position on the
other side. The eight-inch howitzer captured at
Chinhut was placed in a battery which opened fire
upon the Residency buildings. Before many hours
were over the position was completely invested.
The nearest houses were rapidly loopholed, and from
there came a hot musketry fire.</p>

<p>The unfortunate day at Chinhut precipitated every-
thing, and many of the fortifications planned by Sir
Henry were rendered impossible. The provisioning,
too, was incomplete. No one had dreamt of the
isolation of the Residency. It never seemed possible
that they would eventually be unable to communicate
with the city, as was now the case. Scores of
<pb n="151"/>
families had brought in their native servants, but
many of these were shut out on the first day. All
attempts to return to the Residency were useless.
The musketry fire was unceasing, and they would
have been shot down either by friend or foe.</p>

<p>But though the servants who were outside could
not get back, those inside were able to run away,
and many succeeded in doing so, taking with them
all the portable property they could lay their hands
upon. These desertions were not to be wondered
at. Many of the natives were without places of
shelter, and they preferred seeking safety among
their fellows to remaining with their masters ex-
posed to shot and shell.</p>

<p>Owing to the absence of servants a tremendous
state of confusion arose in the streets, lanes and
open spaces intervening between the various houses
within the fortifications. The commissariat and
battery bullocks had no attendants to look after
them, and went wandering all over the place
searching for food. They tumbled into wells, and
were afterwards shot down in numbers by the enemy.</p>

<p>All this subsequently added greatly to the labour
which fell on the garrison. Fatigue parties of
civilians and officers, after being in the defences all
day repelling the enemy's attack, were often em-
ployed six or seven hours burying cattle killed
during the day, which from the excessive heat be-
came offensive and dangerous in a few hours.</p>

<p>The artillery and other horses were commonly to
be seen loose, fighting and tearing at one another,
driven mad for want of food and water. The garri-
son was too busily employed in the trenches to be
able to secure them.</p>

<pb n="152"/>
<p>For two or three days, consequently, the interior
of the Residency fortifications was a perfect pande-
monium. Nor was it wonderful that panic should
seize the natives. The depression among the
European soldiers and civilians was great, and sad
and anxious looks met one on all sides.</p>

<p>Sir Henry, throughout the trying time of the first
two days, was seen everywhere. He visited every
post, however exposed its position, however hot the
fire directed against it. The danger was excessive.
The enemy's artillerists, trained by our best in-
structors, were excellent marksmen. With in-
credible rapidity, with remarkable ingenuity and with
indomitable perseverance, the rebels, in the very
first week, made batteries in positions where one
would have thought their erection impossible.
Heavy artillery was moved to the tops of houses
and other guns placed most cleverly in places where
the British batteries could not effectually open fire
upon them.</p>

<p>It was the morning after the siege had begun
The ladies had passed a terribly anxious night.
They were conscious that if the enemy succeeded in
breaking through the defences and storming the
place, death in its most horrible form awaited every
member of the garrison. Half way through the
night an incessant musketry fire was kept up, and
not one of the occupants of the Residency rooms
closed her eyes. Then came a sudden silence. This
in itself was alarming. Who could tell that it might
not be the precursor of something terrible?</p>

<p>At daylight the firing recommenced. It sounded
some little distance away, but the women dared not
go to the windows to see. From its exposed
<pb n="153"/>
position the Residency became from the very first
moment the principal object of attack.</p>

<p>At last Jean could no longer restrain her anxiety.
She ventured to the window commanding a view of
the Baillie Guard Gate. A great commotion met her
eager anxious gaze.</p>

<p><q>They're attacking the gate!</q> she cried suddenly.</p>

<p>A thrill of terror went through the crowded room.
The women had not yet got used to attacks and
repulses. Despite the danger of her position, Jean
could not tear herself away. She felt a horrible
fascination in the sight. The bravery and tenacity
with which the fight was being maintained by a
mere handful of defenders excited her admiration.</p>

<p>She could see through the gateway. Apparently
the sepoys had succeeded in mounting a gun which
commanded the position. From protected situations
on the roofs of the surrounding houses a murderous fire
was being poured against the gateway. All this was
preparatory to a determined attack.</p>

<p>Suddenly she caught sight of a mass of sepoy caps
through the smoke. They seemed to be coming
nearer and nearer the gateway. From her elevated
position she could see how they were pressing on-
wards. In another minute they would be through
the gateway.</p>

<p>She clasped her hands in fright. If that seething
mass once made its way through, what force was
there inside to prevent it coming straight to the
Residency? What a feeble fire, too, seemed to be
returned by the defenders.</p>

<p><q>Oh, why do not more men go and help them?</q>
she murmured, half aloud.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a slackening in the enemy's
<pb n="154"/>
fire. It was clear they did not want to hit their
own men, and this there was some danger of doing
now that they were so near the gateway. The crowd
of dusky soldiers pressed forward. They were
already three parts of the distance through the big
stone gateway.</p>

<p>Then, as though someone had given the signal,
a fierce fire opened upon the gateway from the inside.
Harmless-looking walls and windows were dotted
with the flash and smoke of muskets. In every
direction these buildings had been loopholed and to
some purpose.</p>

<p>All at once an English cheer awoke the echoes, and
from unseen quarters—Jean could not see whence—
a score or more brave fellows ran out, and, headed
by one whose activity enabled him to outstrip the
rest, charged the gateway, bayonet in hand. She
could not see what happened, but she knew by the
unmistakable English shouts that the rebels had
been driven back. The figure of the leader seemed
familiar to her. It was that of Jack Hawke.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes the gallant little band
returned—not, alas! as they went, for two or
three were being borne by their comrades—but
victorious.</p>

<p>The first attack of the enemy on the Baillie Guard
Gate had failed.</p>

<p>The fire from the outside had almost ceased, and
twenty or thirty men ran forward—not to fight, but
to dig the soft earth within the enclosure, and shovel
it into the gateway. Foot by foot the heap rose,
the men every now and then beating it with their
shovels, and soon a substantial barrier was in
evidence, which only wanted sandbags on the top
<pb n="155"/>
for loopholes to make a formidable fortification.
Never again would the rebel army have such a chance
of storming the Residency as they had that day and
missed.</p>

<p>The band of soldiers who had so bravely defended
the gateway, after leaving the wounded at the
hospital, came towards the Residency.</p>

<p>An hour after the repulse of the rebels at the gate,
a dreadful thing happened, showing in the most
terrible way how unsafe the Residency was. Indeed,
with the exception of the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign> in the basement,
no building could have been less calculated for
purposes of defence, for the numberless lofty windows
in its two upper storeys offered unopposed entrance
to the missiles of the foe.</p>


<p>The daughter of Colonel Palmer (Colonel Palmer
was in command at the Mutcheebhawun), was sitting
in one of these upper rooms of the Residency when
a roundshot struck her, and nearly carried off her
leg. Amputation was immediately had recourse to;
but on the following day the poor girl died. She
was only seventeen, and engaged to be married to
a young officer then in Lucknow.</p>

<p>The incident caused the utmost distress and alarm,
alarm which was increased when the rumour was
spread abroad that Sir Henry Lawrence had had a
narrow escape almost at the same time.</p>

<p>Sir Henry occupied a room on the first storey of
the most exposed angle of the building, and while
engaged in writing with his secretary, Mr Cowper,
an eight-inch shell fell and burst close to them,
but injured neither.</p>

<p>The whole of the staff entreated Sir Henry to
leave the Residency, or at least to choose a different
<pb n="156"/>
apartment. He refused, observing, with a quiet
smile, that another shell would certainly never be
pitched into that small room.</p>

<p>And so he remained, depending, unhappily, on
the doctrine of chances—a doctrine which, before
twenty-four hours had gone by, played him false.</p>

<p>But while indifferent to his own safety, he was not
less solicitous concerning the safety of others. Half-
an-hour after the accident to Miss Palmer, he entered
the ladies' quarters. At once he was surrounded by
the frightened women.</p>

<p><q>You must all get ready to remove to the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>,</q>
said he. <q>It is the only safe place in the Residency.
No shot or shell can reach you there.</q></p>

<p><q>And you, Sir Henry?</q> Jean asked.</p>

<p><q>I remain where I am, my dear Miss Atherton,</q>
said he.</p>

<p><q>But is your room safe? Is not your life more
important than anyone else's?</q></p>

<p><q>We have all to live our time. I must take my
chance like the rest.</q></p>

<p>Sir Henry's orders to remove were instantly obeyed.
Nearly every lady had to be her own porter. The
servants had gone, and none of the men could be
spared for the work. For some two or three hours
there was nothing but a continual procession up and
down the stairs to and from the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>, which, it
will be remembered, was practically a subterranean
apartment. It was well adapted for the purpose to
which it was to be devoted.</p>

<p>As Jean was staggering down the staircase under
the weight of a heavy load, she felt it suddenly lifted
from her.</p>

<p><q>Let me carry it for you,</q> said a voice in the
<pb n="157"/>
gloom. <q>It's too heavy for your arms. I'm rather
a sweep just now, so please don't look at me.</q></p>

<p>And Jack Hawke insisted upon retaining the load
he had lifted from Jean's hands.</p>

<p>He spoke the truth when he said he was rather
a sweep. His face and hands were blackened with
gunpowder; he was in his shirt-sleeves, which were
rolled up almost to his shoulders, showing the fine
muscular development of his arms.</p>

<p><q>You're quite well now, Captain Hawke, I hope?</q>
said Jean. She thought she had not seen him since
he raised his cap as he was riding to the fatal field
of Chinhut. But she was mistaken.</p>

<p><q>Yes; and I was lucky enough to come through
the Chinhut business without a scratch.</q></p>

<p>Something in the twist of his shoulders reminded
her of the man who led the repulse at the Baillie
Guard Gate.</p>

<p><q>Were you not out early this morning at the Gate?</q>
she asked.</p>

<p><q>Did you see that rough-and-tumble affair? The
beggars won't show their noses in that gateway again
in a hurry, I fancy.</q></p>

<p><q>It was very brave of you!</q> cried Jean, with spark-
ling eyes.</p>

<p><q>You know I would do anything for you and the
other ladies,</q> he returned.</p>

<p>Jean cast down her eyes. The vibration in his
voice, the sudden lowering of the tone, seemed
dangerously full of meaning.</p>

<p>She was walking by his side. He had possessed
himself of her burden in a sort of masterful way
heedless of her protests.</p>

<p><q>Is it really true we were so badly defeated
<pb n="158"/>
yesterday?</q> she asked, in order to give the conversa-
tion a less personal turn.</p>

<p><q>Too true. It's a wonder we were not cut to pieces,
a marvel that anyone got back here with a whole
skin. The Pandies were led better yesterday than ever
they were before. Do you know why?</q></p>

<p><q>No. We have heard so few details. The men
have something better to do than gossip with
women.</q></p>

<p><q>What! hasn't Lennard told you anything?
He's a great friend of yours, isn't he?</q></p>

<p>They were in the full glare of a window when he said
this. His fiery eyes seemed to devour her face.
What he had seen in the Residency garden, and
what he had heard, dwelt continually in his mind.
Though she had certainly refused Dr Lennard, she
might have concealed her real feelings.</p>

<p><q>Women are all born actresses,</q> he muttered to
himself; <q>though why on earth they should be so
fond of going a mile round instead of taking the
straight road I never for the life of me could under-
stand.</q></p>

<p>If he thought to catch her he was mistaken.
Her face did not show the least confusion, and this
composure was to him a great relief.</p>

<p><q>Oh, he is very kind. Dr Lennard is a great
friend of papa's,</q> said she. <q>But tell me about the
battle. You were saying——</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, the battle yes. The leader of the rebels is
a European. I'd give a thousand pounds to bury
my sword in the scoundrel's heart.</q></p>

<p><q>Is it really possible any European can be so
wicked as to support the sepoys against us?</q> cried
Jean.</p>

<pb n="159"/>
<p><q>It looks like it. There's been no end of talk
about the villain. He commanded the cavalry at
Chinhut, and one of our fellows saw him this
morning laying the eight-inch howitzer we had to
leave behind, and bringing it to bear on the
Residency.</q></p>

<p>At that moment an officer cannoned against
Hawke.</p>

<p><q>By Jove—Hawke!</q> exclaimed the new-comer.
<q>You're the very man I've been looking for. Excuse
me, Miss Atherton, if I rob you of your luggage-
bearer.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, he's given me all the assistance he can. I
release him with my thanks,</q> said Jean.</p>

<p>Hawke bent his eyes to her face, and his lips
moved as if he were about to say something. How-
ever, he uttered no sound. He deposited the
package on the floor of the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>, held the door
open for Jean, and bowed as she passed.</p>

<p><q>I wish you'd come at any other time, Robson!</q>
he growled.</p>

<p><q>I'm sorry. I hate to spoil sport. But we've got
other things to think of besides doing light porters'
work for girls.</q></p>

<p><q>And don't I know that as well as you?</q> retorted
Hawke angrily. <q>Were you at the Baillie Guard
Gate this morning?</q></p>

<p><q>No, I wasn't, but don't row me, old fellow; I
meant nothing.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well, what is it you want?</q></p>

<p><q>I've just heard that Sir Henry has decided to
abandon the Mutcheebhawun. He's convinced that
with the crowd of howling devils round us he can't
maintain the two places.</q></p>

<pb n="160"/>
<p><q>Of course he can't! Well?</q></p>

<p><q>The difficulty is how to communicate with
Colonel Palmer, who's in command. Gubbins has
had a message from Palmer to the effect that
ammunition and provisions are both running short;
but Gubbins hasn't been able to communicate with
Palmer. He's sent two or three messengers, but he
knows they've never reached the colonel. You see,
the guns of the rebels sweep the ground intervening
between the Residency entrenchments and the
Mutcheebhawun.</q></p>

<p><q>And does Sir Henry want a volunteer to take a
message to Palmer?</q> said Hawke, with a grim smile.</p>

<p><q>No, not quite that; but something almost as
risky. He wants the telegraph rigged up on the top
of the Residency roof.</q></p>

<p>This had been previously arranged by the engineer
in concert with the one on the Mutcheebhawun. It
simply consisted of a post with a bar on the top,
from which were suspended in one row black stuffed
bags, each having its own pulley to work it. By the
signalling of those black bags, messages were sent.
The contrivance was not in good order, and if it had
been, there was no other means of manipulating it
save by standing on the roof. The operator
practically served as a target for the enemy's
marksmen.</p>

<p><q>And you thought I might like to do it, eh?</q>
said Hawke, with a peculiar expression on his face.</p>

<p><q>I didn't know. You're such a dare-devil; no-
thing seems to come amiss to you. It wants a cool
head, and you've got that when you're in danger of
losing it.</q></p>

<p><q>Humph!</q></p>

<pb n="161"/>
<p>Just at that moment the door opened and Jean
came out.</p>

<p><q>Robson's right,</q> he muttered. <q>Cool enough
when my head's in danger, but not when the danger
lies near my heart. Yes, I'll go; but this girl? If
I peg out, I'd like her to know that she is the only
being in this world I'd be sorry to leave.</q></p>

<p>Jean was passing him with a slight bow. If he
hesitated, the opportunity would be gone.</p>

<p><q>Robson,</q> said he hurriedly, <q>cut away to Sir
Henry and tell him I'm following you. Quick, old
chap!</q></p>

<p>He half pushed Robson in front of Jean, delaying
her progress somewhat, and watched the young
officer spring up the stairs three at a time.</p>

<p><q>Miss Atherton,</q> said he, a grim smile lighting up
his face. <q>If I were never to see you again, would
you be very sorry?</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly. Why not? I suppose we ought to
be sorry for each other, seeing our terrible position,</q>
said Jean quietly, although she was not unconscious
of a sudden flutter of the heart.</p>

<p><q>That's all very well; but it isn't quite what I
mean. Let me put it another way. If you were to
die, I should simply rush among those rascals out-
side and get my death as quickly as I could. Do
you understand that feeling?</q></p>

<p>Jean's heart went pit-a-pat. The vehemence, the
fierce passion of this man, frightened her. She could
not mistake his meaning. He was madly in love
with her, and yet he had never mentioned love.
The situation was embarrassing. To say that she
did understand him would be to hasten a confession
she did not want to hear.</p>

<pb n="162"/>
<p><q>When death is so near to all of us,</q> at last she
answered slowly, <q>isn't it folly to say what we
should or should not do?</q></p>

<p>To persist in assuming that his remark applied
generally was perhaps the best reply she could
make.</p>

<p><q>Maybe you're right. Anyhow, my time isn't
come yet,</q> he continued, suddenly changing his
tone. <q>Good-bye, Miss Atherton. We may meet
again, after all.</q></p>

<p>He put out his hand, and she could not refuse
hers. He raised her fingers to his lips, and then,
turning, ran up the stairs after Robson to obtain his
instructions from Sir Henry Lawrence.</p>

<p>Sir Henry had been for some time that day in
conference with Jean's father, whom he had placed
in a responsible post in connection with the pro-
visioning of the various garrisons. With his business
methods and power of organisation, Mr Atherton
had proved himself invaluable. Atherton had not
left the old chief when Hawke entered the room.
Captain Fulton of the Engineers and Mr G. H.
Lawrence, Sir Henry's nephew, were also with Sir
Henry.</p>

<p><q>Captain Hawke,</q> said Sir Henry, <q>Fulton tells
me you have volunteered to help him and my
nephew to reopen the telegraph. You know the risk,
of course.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, sir. It's not worth thinking about. Sepoy
bullets don't trouble me save for one reason, and
that's my affair.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well, then good luck go with you.</q></p>

<p>Hawke saluted, and with Fulton and young
Lawrence, quitted the room. To look at their
<pb n="163"/>
unmoved faces, no one would have imagined they
might be going to their deaths.</p>

<p><q>Hawke's a singularly plucky chap,</q> said Ather-
ton, after a pause, when he was again alone with
Sir Henry. <q>He seems to delight in being in
danger. It almost suggests that he has no desire
to live.</q></p>

<p><q>Luck's been against him, I'm afraid. Hawke's
one of those easy-going fellows who people say are
nobody's enemy but their own.</q></p>

<p><q>That's true. I always liked Hawke, in spite of
his follies. I verily believe that if in his young wild
days fate hadn't thrown him against an unprincipled
woman, he would have been as exemplary an officer
as any in the service. His men idolised him. If
bravery is any atonement for sins, Hawke has
certainly wiped out his.</q></p>

<p><q>That's true. Well, I hope he'll get through this
dangerous business all right and live to make some
good woman happy,</q> rejoined Sir Henry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the three gallant volunteers had
ascended to the roof by means of the spiral staircase
in the octagonal dome-crowned tower at one of the
angles of the building. They had been at work five
minutes repairing the apparatus, before they were
spied by the sharpshooters posted in some of the
tall houses near.</p>

<p>Rifle balls rained upon the gallant workers, prin-
cipally from the top of the gaol. Some of the ropes of
the bags were actually cut by the bullets, but the men
went on coolly. After three hours' hard work under
a broiling sun and a heavy fire, the transfer of
messages was at last completed—a plucky piece of
work indeed.</p>

<pb n="164"/>
<p>Then came the sending of the all-important
message to Colonel Palmer. It ran thus:</p>

<p><q>Spike the guns well, blow up the fort, and retire
at midnight!</q></p>

<p>The safety of the three men and the success of
their mission were at once reported to Sir Henry,
and Atherton descended to convey the news to the
ladies' quarters. Jean, he could not help noticing,
was quite agitated—an unusual thing with her—
when he announced that not one of the brave trio
was hurt. She suddenly paled even to her lips,
swayed once or twice and would have fallen had not
her father caught her. She was faint, but she never
lost consciousness.</p>

<p><q>My dear child!</q> exclaimed her father anxiously
<q>You're not well. Lennard's not far off. Someone
here will go for him, I'm sure.</q></p>

<p><q>No—no. Please don't. There's nothing the
matter with me. I'm all right again. See.</q></p>

<p>She tried to smile and succeeded fairly well, but
her father was somewhat doubtful, while her evident
distress at the suggestion of sending for Lennard
was certainly puzzling.</p>

<p>For days past Atherton had had every minute
of his time occupied. When he was not looking
after the commissariat, he had a rifle in his hand, and
he had not had an opportunity of talking to Lennard
about Jean. He had, however, hoped that the young
doctor had spoken, and that the answer had been
favourable. At the same time it had struck him
as strange that Lennard on the two or three occasions
when they had met, had been silent on a subject
which could not but be very dear to his heart.</p>

<p>Jean's disinclination to see the doctor seemed to
<pb n="165"/>
indicate that all was not right. Had they quarrelled?
Mr Atherton asked himself. But for the moment
he said nothing. He would wait until Jean was
more herself.</p>

<p>Soon she was laughing and romping with some
of the little ones, and it did not appear as though
her faintness had left any ill effects. Her father
seized his opportunity when she sat down, hot and
flushed, to rest, and he drew a chair close to her.</p>

<p><q>Let us have a little talk, my dear,</q> said he.
<q>We don't get many chances of exchanging ideas,
do we?</q></p>

<p><q>No indeed. Poor father,</q> she rejoined laugh-
ingly. <q>I can hardly recognise my neat, trimly
dressed papa, who once never did anything for him-
self, and who now has to work hard not only for
himself but for other people as well.</q></p>

<p>Mr Atherton smiled. He was like the rest,
beginning to look somewhat ragged in his attire.</p>

<p><q>We're all equals now, Jean, and everyone must
take his share of what there is to do, and without
grumbling. But never mind about that. I wanted
to talk to you about yourself—and Ernest Lennard.</q></p>

<p>Jean flushed slightly and her hands trembled.
It was evident her nerves were not quite under
control.</p>

<p><q>Why do you couple our names?</q> she asked,
with a sudden catching of the breath.</p>

<p><q>My dear child, the terrible position into which
we have been forced makes life seem but a trivial
thing. Hours, days, weeks, months are but minutes
with us. There's no time to waste in misunderstand-
ings. You see that, don't you?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, yes,</q> she replied in a low voice. <q>That is
<pb n="166"/>
why I did not want to have any misunderstanding
with Ernest Lennard.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah,</q> cried her father. <q>Then he has spoken?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. He asked me to be his wife. It was pain-
ful for me to say no. I like Dr Lennard very much,
father, but I never could love him. I—I had to say
this. What was the use of being anything but
honest? I was so sorry for him, but what could I
do?</q></p>

<p>The keen-eyed magistrate had not studied human
nature for nothing. Jean's confusion told him that
her refusal of Lennard was not based so much on
her assertion that she could not love him as that her
love was given elsewhere. He forebore questioning
her; at the same time he was grievously disappointed
at Lennard's failure. But who can read the secrets
of a woman's heart, or understand the motives that
lead her to accept one man and reject another?</p>

<p>At that moment Atherton unexpectedly had an
answer to the question which delicacy prevented
him putting to his daughter. Hawke had entered
the room and was immediately surrounded by the
women, who commenced heaping congratulations
and compliments upon him. Hawke appeared quite
indifferent to their admiration. His eyes were fixed
on Jean, and her father saw the tell-tale colour in
the girl's cheeks and the sudden sparkle in her eyes.</p>

<p>The discovery was a revelation to Atherton, yet
he could not find it in his heart to blame his daughter,
The time was one when heroism, endurance and
contempt for death could not fail to appeal to an
imaginative and sympathetic girl. No, it was not
wonderful that Jean should fall in love with the
reckless, the picturesque, the plucky Jack Hawke.
<pb n="167"/>
whom everybody liked and for whom everybody was
sorry.</p>

<p>The magistrate's eyes shone with love and pity
as he drew his daughter to him and kissed her.</p>

<p><q>I think I understand, my poor Jean,</q> he whispered.
<q>I pray God you may be happy.</q></p>

<p>He passed from the room. Fate ordained that
father and daughter should never meet again, for
within a week the brave and devoted Atherton was
destined to answer the roll call of death. The end
came in a merciful form, the bullet that struck him
in the forehead killing him instantly. Many days
passed before the news was brought to Jean, and by
that time much had happened.</p>

<pb n="168"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="11">XI</num></head>
<head type="main">After Life's Fitful Fever</head>

<p>Sir Henry Lawrence had never been so untiring
in his activity, as on the day when the order was
given to evacuate the Mutcheebhawun. It was as
though he had a foreboding of the calamity which
was to happen within the next twenty-four hours,
and wanted to utilise every minute before the last.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the enemy had opened fire against the
Mutcheebhawun; and the guns of the battery, after
replying, ceased some time before midnight. This
indifference to the rebel cannonade quite deceived
the mutineers. They believed the place to be im-
pregnable, and thinking they were wasting powder
and shot, also ceased firing. The last thing they
imagined was that the place was about to be
evacuated and the idea of blockading the garrison
never occurred to them.</p>

<p>They were further deceived by Sir Henry's ruse
of opening a fierce fire from the Residency upon the
iron bridge between the Residency and the Mutchee-
bhawun. Not a sepoy remained. Never did the
rebels suspect that the plan of keeping the bridge
clear was to enable the troops to pass from one
stronghold to another. The distance between the
two places was about three quarters of a mile, and
shortly after midnight the force began noiselessly to
move out. The greater portion of the heavier guns
<pb n="169"/>
had to be left behind, but the troops managed to
bring with them two nine-pounders. With such
speed did they move, that the 225 men of whom the
garrison consisted, the guns, and the treasure, arrived
in the Residency in fifteen minutes without having
a shot fired at them.</p>

<p>A catastrophe very nearly happened. It was a
very dark night, and when the advance guard reached
the entrance to the Residency, the officer in com-
mand called out:</p>

<p><q>Open the gates!</q></p>

<p>The gunners inside heard the voice, but imagined
it came from one of their own officers within the
walls, and that what he said was not <q>Open the
gates,</q> but <q>Open <emph>with grape</emph>!</q></p>

<p>At this one of the men was about to fire, when an
officer, rushing up, dashed the gunner aside, and so
averted a terrible disaster.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the train for the destruction of the fort
had been laid by Lieutenant Thomas of the Madras
Artillery. The explosion was timed to take place
half-an-hour after the departure of the garrison.
Sir Henry Lawrence and a group of officers stood
awaiting the event.</p>

<p>At the appointed time a blaze of fire shot up to
the sky, followed by a deafening report, and a huge
dense cloud of smoke, which hung silently over the
city for a long time before it dispersed. By that
explosion were destroyed 240 barrels of gunpowder,
and 6,000,000 ball cartridges, but it compassed the
complete dismantlement of the fortress. A vast
quantity of percussion caps, with many lacs and 250
boxes of small-arm ammunition, were sacrificed at
the same time, to say nothing of all the stores which
<pb n="170"/>
Sir Henry Lawrence had been at such trouble and
expense to get together.</p>

<p>The evacuation of the Mutcheebhawun was a
relief to the mind of Sir Henry Lawrence. Not only
did the garrison make a welcome addition to the
little force in the Residency, sadly depleted by the
Chinhut disaster, but it removed a constant source of
anxiety.</p>

<p>Indeed, as Colonel Inglis afterwards wrote in his
despatch, if it had not been for this wise and strategic
measure, in all probability no member of the Luck-
now garrison would have survived to tell the tale.
The Mutcheebhawun was commanded from other
parts of the town, and was, moreover, indifferently
provided with heavy artillery ammunition, and if the
original intention of holding both the Mutchee-
bhawun and the Residency had been adhered to, both
would inevitably have fallen.</p>

<p>It was a piece of good fortune, too, that Sir Henry
Lawrence was so prompt in ordering the abandon-
ment. The time, quite by chance, was well chosen.
The enemy had determined, before they commenced
in earnest to besiege the Residency to devote a
preliminary night to the plunder of the town. They
were engaged in this congenial work when the
explosion of the Mutcheebhawun signified to them
that they had missed a great opportunity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, since their meeting in the Residency
garden, Jean had not seen Ernest Lennard. After
Chinhut, the little hospital became full of wounded,
and the medical staff had as much as it could do.
Jean had not gone into the hospital after her first
attempt to assist in tending the wounded. She
had not yet become hardened to the horrors of war,
<pb n="171"/>
and Dr Macpherson forbade her the place for a
couple of days at least.</p>

<p><q>Puir lassie!</q> he muttered. <q>It won't be long
before the whole of the Residency will be one
hospital, and she'll have enough to do then.</q></p>

<p>Anxious as she was to help, Jean was grateful to
the old doctor, and in obedience to his command, she
kept within the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>.</p>

<p>Edith Ross, on the other hand, suddenly became
deeply interested in hospital work; and as she was
a woman of extraordinary nerve, Macpherson en-
couraged her attendance.</p>

<p>Once or twice she met Lennard, and would have
stopped him; but he either did not care to talk or
was too busy. He simply bowed, and hurriedly passed
on. But this was immediately after the wounded
had been brought in, and there was ample reason
why he should not loiter. After a couple of days had
gone by the strain upon his services was not so great,
and on the 2nd of July, the day after the blowing up
of the Mutcheebhawun, he was proceeding, weary
and fagged, towards his quarters, when he suddenly
came face to face with Mrs Ross. Apparently it was
a chance meeting, for the lady started as though she
had been thinking of anything but meeting him.</p>

<p>And yet purpose regulated most of Mrs Ross's
happenings, and she had no desire that Jean
Atherton's refusal of Ernest Lennard should be
taken as final. She had long desired an opportunity
of discussing the matter with him, and now with
consummate tact introduced the subject. But Len-
nard did not carry his heart upon his sleeve, and had
no desire to bare his hand to anyone. He had
learned the truth of the old Scripture: <q>The heart
<pb n="172"/>
knoweth its own bitterness, and the stranger inter-
meddleth not with its sorrow.</q></p>

<p>Mrs Ross would have detained Lennard, for she
had much to say to him, but he was not in the mood
for conversation, and somewhat abruptly said:</p>

<p><q>Good-bye for the present. I've two hours' leave
from Macpherson, and I want to spend the whole of
it in sleep, if I can.</q></p>

<p>He bowed and walked rapidly away.</p>

<p>Edith Ross stood quietly watching his retreating
figure. Then she walked on slowly, talking to her-
self softly. Her thoughts were so absorbing, it is
doubtful if she even heard the booming of the
cannon and volleys of musketry fire coming from all
sides.</p>

<p>It was a matter of common talk among her friends
how Mrs Ross had altered in appearance during the
last three weeks. Her sallowness had gone, the
wrinkles about the eyes had filled up, the lines at
the corners of the mouth had softened, her eyes had
regained a good deal of their old brilliancy, when a
single glance would set the heart of a susceptible
subaltern aflame. In a word, she looked ten years
younger.</p>

<p>Why was this? Edith Ross herself could not
or would not say, and only laughed when any of
the officers complimented her on looking so well.
The explanation was very simple. The sight of
the man she loved with all the fervour of her Eastern
nature had renewed her youth.</p>

<p>Little by little she had worn down Hawke's anger.
If not absolutely friends, they were not absolutely
enemies, and she did not despair of winning him
back.</p>

<pb n="173"/>
<p><q>He's smitten by Jean Atherton's pretty face, but
his love won't last,</q> she had said to herself over and
over again. <q>I know him too well.</q></p>

<p>She decided she had made a mistake in trying
to set Jean against Hawke, and latterly she had
never mentioned his name. It was far better policy
to pretend to be indifferent to him, and to appear to
be furthering his interests with Jean.</p>

<p><q>It's all happened for the best,</q> she murmured.
<q>Jack imagines that because Jean refused Dr
Lennard that therefore she is free. Supposing I
persuade Jack that his turn has now come; that Jean
herself has dropped a few words in his favour? It's
better to bring matters to a crisis. If he gets his
refusal from the girl's own lips that will end the
matter; and then—well, why shouldn't my time
come at last?</q></p>

<p>It was a pleasant dream.</p>

<p><q>Jack never cared for a doll-like face in the old
days, and though I don't say Jean Atherton's face
is doll-like—I'll give her that due, although I
hate her—I don't believe it's the style he cares for.
Bah! what fools men are—and women too,</q> she
added, with sudden tightening of the lips. <q>But
I'll never let my temper get the better of me again.
No, for the future, I'll be more discreet. He shall
never feel the noose is over his head until it is there
securely.</q></p>

<p>She paced up and down the corridor outside the
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>, thinking, planning, revolving. Never once
did it occur to her that a chance bullet might put an
end to all her dreams. She had made up her mind
that sooner or later she would have Jack Hawke's
love and satisfy her own; and when she had made up
<pb n="174"/>
her mind the thing was fixed. What had chance to
do with it?</p>

<p><q>Yes, Jack can propose to Jean Atherton if he
likes,</q> she repeated, with a scornful smile, <q>and per-
haps after all the sooner the better.</q></p>

<p>The possibility of Jean Atherton accepting Hawke
certainly did flit before her like a dark shadow, but
she brushed it away impatiently as a most unlikely
contingency.</p>

<p><q>Jack's way with women is dangerous. What he
hasn't got in speech he makes up in impetuosity,
and she might be won over. Well, well,</q> she con-
tinued, impatiently, <q>I shall know what to do.
There are other ways.</q></p>

<p>She was about to return to the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign> when
she heard her name suddenly pronounced. She
turned and saw the subject of her thoughts—Jean
Atherton. Jean had just run down the staircase and
was within a few feet of her. She was very pale,
and her eyes had a look of fright in them.</p>

<p><q>Oh, Mrs Ross,</q> she exclaimed, <q>a terrible thing
has happened! Poor Sir Henry Lawrence——</q> she
stopped and burst into tears.</p>

<p><q>What have you heard about Sir Henry?</q></p>

<p><q>He's been horribly wounded. They say he can't
possibly live. Oh, it's frightful!</q></p>

<p>For a brief space Edith Ross forgot her selfish
thoughts; but not for long. If Sir Henry were
dead, others would take his place. Jean was terribly
distressed, and could hardly muster sufficient calm-
ness to disclose what she had heard.</p>

<p>At dawn of day, it appeared, Sir Henry Lawrence
rose, and with his wonted activity, superintended the
new arrangements which had become necessary owing
<pb n="175"/>
to the welcome accession of force which the dark
hours had brought him. He had seen new detach-
ments posted and new guns planted; and when the
morning sun had become oppressive, he returned to
the Residency and rested on a couch while he was
issuing his instructions.</p>

<p>His nephew, George Lawrence, was lying on
another couch in the same room. By the general's
side stood Captain Wilson, assistant adjutant-
general, waiting the orders of his chief. There was
also a native servant in the room.</p>

<p>What followed is best told in Captain Wilson's
own words:</p>

<p><q rend="I">Sir Henry had desired me to draw up a me-
morandum as to how the natives were to be distributed,
and I went into the next room to write it; but
previous to doing so I reminded him of his promise
to go to the room below, for we had at last persuaded
him to remove. He said he was very tired, and
would rest a couple of hours, and that then he would
have his things removed.</q></p>

<p><q rend="I">In about half-an-hour I went back into the room
with what I had written. His nephew, Mr George
Lawrence, was then lying on a small bed parallel to
his uncle's, with a very few feet between them.</q></p>

<p><q rend="I">I went between the beds, and stood on the right-
hand side of Sir Henry's, with one knee resting on it.
A native servant was sitting on the floor pulling the
punkah.</q></p>

<p><q>I read what I had written. It was not quite in
accordance with his wishes, and he was in the act of
explaining what he desired altered, when the fatal
shot came. A sheet of flame, a terrific shock, and
a dense darkness is all I can describe.</q></p>

<pb n="176"/>
<p>Captain Wilson was thrown to the ground, but on
recovering himself he cried out: <q>Sir Henry, are you
hurt?</q></p>

<p>At first there was no answer, but after a little while
the feeble voice of the chief commissioner was heard
to say:</p>

<p><q>I am killed.</q></p>

<p>The punkah had come down with the ceiling, and
a great deal of the plaster, and the dust and smoke
were so great it was some minutes before anything
could be seen. As the air became clearer Wilson
saw that the white coverlet on which Sir Henry lay
was crimson with his blood.</p>

<p>He had received his death wound from the fatal
howitzer, first found in a Lucknow house, used at
Chinhut, there abandoned, and brought by the rebels
once more into the city. A shell from this gun had
exploded in the general's room, and a fragment of it
had wounded him fearfully on the upper part of the
left thigh.</p>

<p>At the sound of the explosion a handful of soldiers
rushed in and placed Sir Henry on a chair. Captain
Wilson then found that the back of his shirt was all
blown off (he had on only a shirt and trousers); that
he was slightly wounded by a fragment of the shell
and that the servant pulling the punkah had had one
of his feet cut off by another fragment of the shell.
Mr George Lawrence was alone of the four in the
room unhurt, and he ran at once for Dr Fayrer, who,
upon his arrival, found that Sir Henry had been
removed to a small apartment, not so much exposed,
adjoining the drawing-room. Here he lay, surrounded
by his friends.</p>

<p>Though he seemed to be under the impression he
<pb n="177"/>
was in the agonies of death, Sir Henry was talking
quite calmly to the people about him.</p>

<p><q>Doctor,</q> said the brave old gentleman quietly,
<q>how long have I to live?</q></p>

<p><q>I cannot promise more than forty-eight hours,</q>
said Fayrer mournfully.</p>

<p><q>So long? I did not think I had as many minutes.
Well, well, I will do my duty to the last.</q></p>

<p>It was useless to think of amputating the limb.
All that could be done was to palliate his sufferings
and maintain his strength. The little life that was
left in him might still be serviceable to his country-
men, and it was right to lengthen it to the utmost.</p>

<p>He had already bethought himself of what was to
be done in the event of the mortal blow descending
upon him and there was no hurry or indecision.</p>

<p>He had previously obtained the sanction of Govern-
ment to the appointment of Major Banks as his
successor in the office of chief commissioner, and he
now formally made over the charge. Colonel Inglis
was given the chief military command.</p>

<p>How it came about no one could say, but it is
certain that the news of Sir Henry's mortal wound
reached the enemy, and within half-an-hour that
portion of the Residency was subjected to a terrible
bombardment.</p>

<p><q>The bloodthirsty demons!</q> exclaimed Fayrer.
<q>The poor general musn't remain here. It's torture.
He must come to my house.</q></p>

<p>And so, with all tenderness and care, he was carried
to Dr Fayrer's residence, which was less within the
reach of the rebel guns, though open to their musketry.
There his last hours were passed.</p>

<p>Dismal indeed seemed the outlook in the Residency
<pb n="178"/>
when, on the 4th of July, it was announced that the
loved chief was no more.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour before Sir Henry's death his nephew,
Mr G. Lawrence, was shot through the shoulder as
he was standing in the verandah of Dr Fayrer's house.
He was taken into the room where his uncle lay dying.</p>

<p>Sir Henry could not be buried until nightfall.
Had the interment taken place in the daytime it
would have meant more deaths, for the musketry
volleys were fierce and incessant. When the burial
was determined upon, half-a-dozen soldiers were
called in for the purpose, and one of them, lifting
the sheet from the face, kissed it reverently.</p>

<p>As in the case of Sir John Moore, no military
honours marked the funeral. A hurried prayer was
read amidst the booming of cannon and the fire of
musketry, and the remains of the good and great
man were lowered into the pit with those of his
comrades-in-arms who had fallen the same day.</p>

<p>Excepting to those in the Residency, the death of
Sir Henry Lawrence was not known to the English
and was kept secret for several days. He was even
reported to be recovering. But at last the truth
could no longer be concealed, and the tidings
were received, to quote Colonel Inglis' despatch,
<q>throughout the garrison with feelings of consterna-
tion, only second to the grief which was inspired in
the hearts of all by the loss of a public benefactor
and a warm personal friend.</q></p>

<p>The last words of the brave Sir Henry Lawrence
were never forgotten, and gave fresh courage to many
a man as he took his post in the early dawn, anxious
that before nightfall he might be numbered among
the slain:</p>

<pb n="179"/>
<p><q>No surrender! Let every man die at his post,
but never make terms. God help the poor women
and children!</q></p>

<p>Had the dying injunction of the heroic old chief
been blazoned on the walls of every house within the
entrenchment, it could not have been more faithfully
obeyed by the nine hundred and twenty-seven men
who composed the Lucknow garrison on the first day
of the siege.</p>

</div>


<div n="12" type="chapter">
<pb n="180"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="12">XII</num></head>
<head type="main">Hawke Tries His Luck</head>

<p>The group of buildings known in those days as the
Residency included a number of houses built for
ordinary domestic use originally separated from each
other by small plots of ground, and subsequently
joined together for defensive purposes by mud walls
and trenches—the mud walls for defence from outer
attack, the trenches for protection against the
enemy's shells. To pretend that these defences were
fortifications in the proper sense of the term is to
overstate the case. All that can be said is that the
walls of the houses were thick, that the bricks were
small and compact, and that happily they were
cemented together by the toughest of mortar, yet
through these barriers the roundshot and shell
of the enemy again and again ploughed their
way.</p>

<p>Most of the garrisons were virtually isolated, and
the inmates of one scarcely knew how the inmates
of the others fared. It was impossible to go outside
many of the houses without being seen and fired at.
Persons passing on duty from one post to another
were constantly wounded.</p>

<p>The numerous points of resistance formed by the
isolated buildings had one advantage. They divided
the attack of the enemy. They were, in addition,
confusing. Had the rebels been commanded by
<pb n="181"/>
a real leader he might have risen to the occasion,
and the end of the siege of Lucknow might have
come about very speedily, but there were divided
counsels, and all this was to the advantage of the
beleaguered garrison.</p>

<p>During the first days of the siege, and especially
after the death of Sir Henry Lawrence, the enemy
maintained almost continually day and night a
storm of roundshot and musketry upon some of the
most exposed positions—such as the Residency, the
Baillie Guard, the post-office, the Sago and Financial
garrisons, and the Cawnpore battery.</p>

<p>The ingenuity of the enemy in finding out the
weak places of the fortifications was remarkable.
Hawke swore that no native had brains enough, and
that it was due to the European leader, whoever he
was.</p>

<p>However this may be, it is certain that while in
order to get at the taller and more exposed positions
the muskets were pointed very high, in the case of
the Cawnpore battery, at the south-east angle of the
entrenchment, the bullets, which were at first aimed
high, gradually came lower, and on the 4th of July,
the day on which Sir Henry Lawrence died, several
poor fellows were shot.</p>

<p>Just outside the entrenchment wall, and separated
from the Cawnpore battery by a wide road, was an
unoccupied house known as Johannes' House. Had
there been time this house would have been de-
molished, as likely to afford cover for the enemy;
but the Chinhut affair hastened everything, and the
house was left standing.</p>

<p>At first it remained empty, as the natives were
afraid it was undermined, a rumour to that effect
<pb n="182"/>
having been circulated before the siege began; but
in two or three days the sepoys obtained possession
of it and it soon became the greatest possible annoy-
ance to the Cawnpore battery.</p>

<p>Johannes' House was surmounted by a turret, and
here a party of the enemy's riflemen were posted,
under the command of an African negro, formerly in
the employ of the ex-King of Oudh. This man was
a splendid shot, and rarely did he fire without killing
or wounding.</p>

<p>In consequence of the fire from this turret, the
Cawnpore battery was rendered almost useless.
Bullets swept down the main street to the west of
the Cawnpore battery, and leading northward to the
Residency and hospital, frequently entering the
windows of the last-named building. By one of
these the Rev. Mr Polehampton, one of the two
chaplains, was severely wounded on the 7th of July.</p>

<p>The Cawnpore battery throughout the siege
occupied a peculiar position. It was constructed of
earth and palisades, and armed with one eight and
two nine pounder guns. The battery was so entirely
commanded by the enemy's works that when under
a heavy fire it could not be defended. For this
reason the commandant of the post was constantly
changed. To be in charge of it for several days
meant certain death. Whoever took command of
the Cawnpore battery, even for a short time, bade
good-bye to his friends.</p>

<p>Many valuable lives were lost in defending the
battery. It might have been abandoned without
much loss, for had it been taken by the enemy it
would have been of little use to them, as it was
entirely commanded by the houses behind it within
<pb n="183"/>
the fortifications. But it served the purpose of
warding off an attack upon the houses it guarded,
and so was maintained.</p>

<p>Owing to the forethought of Sir Henry, there was
no lack of provisions. Of wine and champagne a
more than ample store had been laid in.</p>

<p>After the siege began, and the commissariat
arrangements got into working order, rations were
regularly issued of grain, bullock beef, or mutton,
with flour and rice, and all on a fixed scale. Most
of the residents had provided themselves privately
with a stock of luxuries in the way of preserved
provisions, and these proved welcome additions
whenever a visitor ventured to make a call.</p>

<p>The greatest want was bread. The bakers had,
without exception, deserted; and no one during the
siege seems to have taken up the art of bread-
making. The substitute for bread was the chupatty
—flour kneaded with water, and beaten thin and flat
by clapping it between the hands. These were
baked on iron plates over the fire, and were not
particularly wholesome nor palatable.</p>

<p>There was no sort of regular meal, save for the
ladies. The men usually took their breakfast stand-
ing at their loopholed windows watching the enemy,
their right hands grasping their rifles, the left
occupied with a chupatty or a cup of tea.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, amid all the distracting anxiety and
ever-haunting sense of danger—and even the nearness
of death itself, incident to such circumstances—the
current of human passions—love, jealousy and hate
—continued to flow undisturbed by the storm which
was raging round about.</p>

<p>Edith Ross was delayed in the pursuit of her
<pb n="184"/>
policy of finesse and intrigue. The fierce attack
outside, and the burden of work thrown upon every
man within, frustrated her plans. For two days
after the death of Sir Henry Lawrence she had not
seen Jack Hawke, and did not know where he was
stationed. Neither had she seen Jean, who was
lodged in the house of Commissioner Gubbins, at the
south-west angle of the fortifications. Mrs Ross was
in Dr Fayrer's garrison, near the centre, considered
one of the safest places within the walls.</p>

<p>Accident however intervened and effected what
design had not been able to accomplish. It brought
about a meeting between Jean and Hawke. The
latter arrived at Gubbins' house on the morning of
the 6th, with stores from the commissariat The
enemy's fire at that moment was unusually fierce,
and it was marvellous that Hawke had escaped
unhurt.</p>

<p>When he arrived, all the men were on the roof and
at the barricaded upper windows, picking off any of
the rebels who might dare to show themselves and
so offer opportunity. Some of the women were
doing their best to cook under very adverse circum-
stances, and others—among them Jean—were at-
tending upon a couple of wounded men. It was no
longer a question of moving the wounded to the
general hospital. Each garrison had its own in-
firmary, and the doctors did their best to make
daily rounds.</p>

<p>Jean had gone into one of the lower rooms to get
water, and was alone when Hawke entered.</p>

<p>Neither expected to see the other, and both were
surprised. Hawke's eyes lighted up with a fierce
and unrestrained pleasure.</p>

<pb n="185"/>
<p><q>I'm in luck this morning, Miss Atherton,</q> said
he. <q>I didn't expect to see you here. I heard that
most of the ladies had left the Residency, but I
didn't know how you had been distributed. I am
glad you're with Mr Gubbins. You'll be comfortable
—and safe, I hope. As safe, that is,</q> he added, <q>as
we can expect to be in this trap, with all those
raging devils round us.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, you've all been very good to us poor women,
Captain Hawke. When I think what you alone
have done, and what you've gone through, it almost
seems as if you bore a charmed life.</q></p>

<p>His bronzed cheeks glowed at her words. His
heavy brow lifted; a change came over his face.</p>

<p><q><choice><corr>You</corr><orig>Yon</orig></choice> think of me sometimes, then?</q> said he
quickly. <q>That's kind indeed.</q></p>

<p>His eyes sought hers, but they were cast down,
Four or five days had passed over since he had seen
her, and he noticed how her face—always delicate
and refined—had become, so to speak, etherealised.
Anxiety and trouble, and constant contact with
suffering, had accentuated the pure, womanly qualities
in her nature; and while she was not less lovely,
sympathy, tenderness, and rare courage transfigured
her beauty.</p>

<p><q>I've prayed for all of you. What else can we
do?</q> she replied.</p>

<p>It was as if he did not expect her to reply, for he
went on without a pause:</p>

<p><q>If we can't say what we mean and speak the
truth now, we never shall. No, no—don't leave me!
You shall not! Ah, my God——</q></p>

<p>His glance for a moment had wandered through
the window. The next instant he had caught her
<pb n="186"/>
in his arms and rushed with her to a remote
corner.</p>

<p>An explosion within the room deafened them.
The black acrid smoke was suffocating. A shell had
burst. When the atmosphere became somewhat
clearer, it could be seen that a table close to which
they had been standing in the centre of the room
was shivered to fragments. Had they remained
three seconds longer both must have been killed.</p>

<p><q>Close shave!</q> said Hawke grimly.</p>

<p><q>You are hurt!</q> she cried, trembling convulsively.</p>

<p><q>Am I? Yes; you're right. Only a scratch,
though. Lend me your handkerchief, Jean.</q></p>

<p>It was the first time he had called her by her
Christian name. She did not resent it. How could
she? Hawke had just saved her life. Not only had
he snatched her up as the shell was approaching
the window but he stood in front of her when it
exploded. The splinter which grazed his left arm,
but for his intervention, must have struck her.</p>

<p>With agitated fingers she bound up his arm with
her handkerchief, he meanwhile holding her close to
him, with his right hand around her waist.</p>

<p><q>This is one of my lucky days!</q> he cried exult-
antly.</p>

<p><q>What do you mean?</q> she faltered.</p>

<p><q>Ah, can't you understand ? Can't you see that
I love you—that I'd give my life for you?</q></p>

<p>She was so agitated she knew not what to say.
She vainly strove to release herself. The shock
caused by the explosion made her as helpless as
a child.</p>

<p><q>Won't you give me one word of encouragement?</q>
he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<pb n="187"/>
<p><q>What can I say?</q> she cried piteously. <q>Oh,
why did you tell me that that you loved me?</q></p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p><q>Why not? You don't despise me, do you?
You didn't do so when you had reason—that is, if
you believed what you were told; and why should
you now? I know I've done a good many stupid
things, and maybe a few wicked ones; but I have
never done anything mean or shabby. I came here
a bit of a black sheep, but none of the fellows
and few of the women turn their backs on me
now. I've won over even the sour dowagers, who
looked daggers at me when I first entered the
Residency. What is it that has kept me straight?
Only the thought that some day you might think
me worthy of your love. I thank those howling
demons outside. They've made the moments so
precious we can't afford to lose one of them. My
darling——</q></p>

<p><q>I can't—I won't listen to you, Captain Hawke!</q>
she cried. <q>It's cruel to force me to do so.</q></p>

<p><q>Cruel!</q> he repeated blankly. <q>Why? Is it
a crime for me to love you? Are you not free?
Give me a little hope—the hope that nerves a man's
hand and steels his heart; the hope that the woman
he loves, loves him in return.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I cannot—I cannot!</q> she exclaimed brokenly.
<q>Don't think that I am wanting in gratitude, or that
I do not admire your bravery, but——</q></p>

<p><q>Gratitude—admiration!</q> he burst out passion-
ately. <q>It's your love I want—your love—your love!
Your love alone!</q></p>

<p>Jean shrank from him. He had made not a
request but a demand. What right had he to impose
<pb n="188"/>
his will upon hers? She admitted the fascination of
his personality, but love? She couldn't tell.</p>

<p>She turned and would have escaped had he not
caught her by the wrist.</p>

<p><q>Do not leave me,</q> he said. <q>We may have but
a few hours to live. Why waste those few brief
hours?</q></p>

<p><q>You speak for yourself alone, and that's selfish.
I didn't think it of you. Let me go.</q></p>

<p>A savage look came into his eyes.</p>

<p><q>Tell me why you refuse me. Is there another
more fortunate than I?</q></p>

<p><q>You have no right to question me,</q> cried Jean
with heaving bosom. <q>Let me go!</q></p>

<p>He relinquished her hand, and in a moment she
was gone. His heavy brows were drawn together till
they almost met; the lines about his mouth were
deep and rigid; the veins in his temples stood out
like cords.</p>

<p>He stood looking awhile at the shattered contents
of the room in a stupefied, dazed kind of way. Then
his broad chest rose and fell; a deep sigh escaped
him.</p>

<p>Kicking the debris out of his path, he crossed the
room and went out of the house, taking the direction
of the Cawnpore battery, which was about seven
hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>Hawke was next seen by some of the men in the
house nearest to the Cawnpore battery walking
leisurely along, as though he were strolling in St
James's Park.</p>

<p><q>Look at that fellow Hawke!</q> exclaimed Lieuten-
ant Dawson, in command of the battery for the day.
<q>Did you ever see such a cool hand?</q></p>

<pb n="189"/>
<p><q>By Jove!</q> cried a young ensign admiringly,
<q>why, he doesn't even trouble to walk in the shelter
of the walls. Fancy him choosing the middle of the
road, where the Pandies can see him!</q></p>

<p><q>Humph!</q> said an old sergeant-major. <q>With
all respect to you, sir, I call that foolhardiness. He'd
better not come within the range of <q>Bob the Nailer,</q>
or he'll never take another stroll.</q></p>

<p><q>Bob the Nailer</q> was the name given by the
soldiers to the negro marksman in the turret of
Johannes' House.</p>

<p><q>Bob</q> must have been off duty just then, for
Hawke walked without interruption to the house
from which the men were watching him, while the
bullets flew past him harmlessly.</p>

<p><q>What the devil did you do that for?</q> exclaimed
Dawson, half angrily.</p>

<p><q>Do what?</q> said Hawke, scowling.</p>

<p><q>Tempt death in that absurd fashion. It'll come
soon enough, I reckon, without going to meet it.</q></p>

<p><q>Very likely,</q> said Jack indifferently. <q>I want a
drink, boys, about a couple of <q>pegs.</q></q></p>

<p><q>You can't have one. There's not a drop of
brandy in the battery. I'm not sorry for it, either,
for your sake, Jack. You've kept yourself splendidly
in hand since you've been here. Don't slide back, for
God's sake.</q></p>

<p><q>Go to the devil! I'm dry, I tell you. What's in
these bottles?</q></p>

<p><q>Hock. That won't hurt you.</q></p>

<p><q>Not for me. I can see something that'll suit me
better.</q></p>

<p>He crossed the room and seized a case of cham-
pagne. He broke the neck off a bottle and, pouring
<pb n="190"/>
some of the contents into a mug, almost emptied it
at a draught. The house belonged to a brave French-
man named Duprat, a merchant who did good suit
and service throughout the siege. He was possessed
of a large stock of wine, of which he made generous
use.</p>

<p><q>That's better!</q> exclaimed Hawke, setting down
the mug with a thump. <q>Hand me an Enfield,
Dawson, and I'll go up aloft and try conclusions with
<q>Bob the Nailer.</q> I'd give something to be able to
put a bullet through his ugly black skull.</q></p>

<p><q>You won't do that,</q> returned Dawson. <q>The
scoundrel's far too knowing. He's winged five of our
fellows this morning. By the way, what's brought
you here? You're not on duty to-day.</q></p>

<p><q>I know that as well as you do. But I suppose I
may as well pot a Pandy or two from the roof of
Duprat's house as anyone else.</q></p>

<p>He seized a rifle, provided himself with a stock of
cartridges, and disappeared.</p>

<p><q>Something's gone wrong with Hawke,</q> muttered
Dawson, when he was gone. <q>I know him of old.
Looks as if he were going to break out again. By
Jove! he's like a tiger when he gets a little drink in
him. The odd thing is, he's been quiet for so long.
What's kept him sober, I wonder?</q></p>

<p>The gunners who had been serving the eight
and nine pounders in the battery came off duty for
a brief space at this moment. They brought in
one of their comrades mortally wounded. The
poor fellow breathed his last in about a quarter
of an hour.</p>

<p><q>That cursed nigger's work again!</q> growled one
of the artillery men. <q>We ought to make a rush for
<pb n="191"/>
that house, and blow it to the devil! I'm game to
make one for a try.</q></p>

<p><q>You'll have a chance, Joe Garret, before long,</q>
said his commanding officer encouragingly.</p>

<p>In half-an-hour's time Hawke made his reappear-
ance. He leaned his rifle against the wall with an
air of disgust.</p>

<p><q>Dawson,</q> said he, <q>this is beastly slow work.
I'm not in the mood for playing hide-and-seek
behind chimneypots. I want waking up. What do
you say to walking over to Johannes' House and
driving the beggars out?</q></p>

<p><q>Don't be a fool! Look here, old chap,</q> said
Dawson, suddenly lowering his voice, <q>if you'll keep
your mouth shut, I'll let you into a secret. Sam
Lawrence, Green, and Studdy are coming over here
at midnight. We've settled upon a sortie at daybreak,
and you can join us.</q></p>

<p><q>Good! I'm your man. Pass me that bottle of
champagne.</q></p>

<p><q>You've had enough, you fool!</q></p>

<p><q>Enough or not, I'm going to empty that bottle.</q></p>

<p>And empty it he did, with an air of stubbornness
which showed that opposition was useless.</p>

<p><q>I can't do much good here,</q> said he, <q>I'm off to
the Residency. I'm in the humour for hard work. I
hear they're mining near the Water Gate. Two or
three hours with the pick would suit me just now.
You'll see me here again at midnight.</q></p>

<p><q>Right. But, Hawke, for heaven's sake don't
breathe a word about the sortie. It doesn't do to open
one's mouth too wide. Those scoundrels outside
get to know all our business somehow almost before
we know it ourselves.</q></p>

<pb n="192"/>
<p><q>What do you mean?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know what I do mean exactly, but I
know this—there are any number of spies inside the
fortifications, and you can't be too careful.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I'll be careful enough. Spies? I should like
to meet one. He'd spy no more.</q></p>

<p>Hawke threw on his cap, with a reckless, devil-
may-care air. The effect of the Champagne was
beginning to show itself. He stalked off, humming
a snatch of song, but with an angry glare in his eyes
belying his apparent joyousness.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was quite right in warning Hawke
to be cautious as to what he said about the intended
sortie. Already an uneasy feeling had arisen in more
than one of the garrisons that there was treachery
at work somewhere, and, strange to say, it was not
merely the natives who were suspected. No doubt
the idea that there were Europeans who sided with
the rebels arose from the undoubted fact that a
European officer led the native cavalry in the affair
at Chinhut.</p>

<p>When Dawson warned Hawke the uneasiness
was only just beginning. It increased from day
to day.</p>

<p>Hawke reached the Residency in safety. He did
not trouble to avail himself of the protection the walls
of the houses afforded, but as his road lay through the
centre of the fortifications he was not much exposed
to the fire of the enemy. His object was to see
Colonel Inglis, who was now in command.</p>

<p>To get to the Residency he had to pass Dr Fayrer's
house, and here at one of the windows sat Edith Ross,
watching. It was her only chance of seeing the
object of her infatuation. Directly she caught sight
<pb n="193"/>
of him, she flew down to the entrance and ran out
panting.</p>

<p><q>Jack—Jack!</q> she cried excitedly. <q>Don't go by
without speaking to me. I've been worrying lest
something should have happened. I've heard nothing
of you for two days!</q></p>

<p>Hawke looked at her in a dazed sort of way. He
was in no mood to be thwarted. And yet Edith
Ross at that moment looked unusually attractive to
a man of an excitable temperament. Her mobile
lips were slightly parted, her dark lustrous eyes
scintillated with abnormal brilliancy. Her olive
cheeks were tempered by a warmth of tint rarely seen
upon them.</p>

<p><q>Your anxiety is flattering,</q> he said, with a covert
sneer, <q>but you have no need to worry upon my
account.</q></p>

<p>A gleam of malice shot into her eyes for a
moment, and then as quickly disappeared.</p>

<p><q>You're not yourself, Jack,</q> she said. <q>What is
the matter?</q> And then a bow drawn at a venture,
a bolt from the blue—<q>Has Jean Atherton refused
you?</q></p>

<p>Hawke staggered back a pace.</p>

<p><q>What if she has, it is no concern of yours, and I
have not done with her yet!</q></p>

<p><q>Fool!</q> she said, with scorn and contempt in her
voice. <q>Can you not see that she loves another?</q></p>

<p><q>Another!</q> he gasped. <q>Who is he and where
may he be found?</q></p>

<p><q>In London, to be sure—an early love, a love
that the sea cannot drown nor time alter.</q></p>

<p>He turned from her roughly, but she clung to him
and implored him to stay; he flung her from him and
<pb n="194"/>
strode off with an unsteady gait, the storm and
passion within him harmonising with the rage and
fire without.</p>

<p>Some hours of sapping duty tamed and sobered
him, a short interval of sleep refreshed him, and at
midnight he was to time at Mr Duprat's house.</p>

</div>



<div n="13" type="chapter">
<pb n="195"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="13">XIII</num></head>
<head type="main">The First Sortie—<q>Bob the Nailer</q></head>

<p>In Duprat's house Hawke found Captain Sam
Lawrence, Ensign Green, and Ensign Studdy, all of
the 32nd. Hawke and a dozen or so of the soldiers
were to make up the party.</p>

<p><q>The plan is this,</q> said Lawrence. <q>A surprise
raid, blast open the door, and do the rest with
sword, bayonet and pistol. Never mind the others
if we smash up <q>Bob the Nailer.</q></q></p>

<p>Noiselessly they stole out, and crossed the inter-
vening space between Duprat's house and the wall,
and then one by one they scaled the mud works and
dropped on the other side. Lawrence himself carried
the bag of powder to burst the door—he would trust
it to no one else.</p>

<p>It was scarcely light. The idea of the sortie party
was to take the natives inside the house unawares,
the chances being that the report of the explosion
at the door would pass unnoticed amid the thunder
going on all round.</p>

<p>In pursuit of this plan a line of dark figures crept
stealthily across the intervening ground. Lawrence
approached the door and placed the charge against
its lower portion. Then he struck a match, and
a little dull, red spark of light began to travel slowly
along the fuse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lawrence returned to his comrades,
<pb n="196"/>
and all waited—waited with faces grim and stern,
with iron fingers gripping sword and rifle.</p>

<p>The interval between placing the bag of gunpowder
at the door and the explosion was probably not five
minutes. It seemed like five hours. Suddenly
there was a flash and a report. The men sprang
forward, Captain Sam Lawrence at their head, and
dashed into the house.</p>

<p>In the lower part were a score of sepoys lying
asleep. The noise of the blasting of the door had
failed to arouse them. What was one report among
so many, even though it were a little louder than
the rest? The first man was bayoneted as he lay,
but he had time to give the alarm before he expired.
Then followed a wild tumult. The sepoys, panic-
stricken, and scarcely able to seize their muskets
before their assailants were on them like wild cats,
were slaughtered to a man.</p>

<p>While this was going on, Captain Lawrence and
Hawke crept upstairs to the turret. There sat
<q>Bob the Nailer,</q> wholly unconscious of their
approach, engaged in returning a fire specially
directed by the men in the Cawnpore battery to
divert his attention.</p>

<p>He had just pulled the trigger when Hawke
rushed at him. Almost before he could realise what
had happened he was a dead man. It was life for
life, for Bob's last shot, delivered almost at the
moment of death, killed one of the 32nd who had
foolishly put his head over the mud wall to see
how the sortie was progressing.</p>

<p><q>Not a bad morning's work!</q> cried Lawrence
exultingly. <q>We've got rid of <q>Bob the Nailer,</q>
and that's as good as despatching a hundred Pandies.</q></p>

<pb n="197"/>
<p><q>And we'll have to do that besides,</q> exclaimed
Hawke, <q>unless we clear out sharp. Look yonder!</q></p>

<p>About five hundred yards away a couple of
hundred sepoys were advancing at the double. The
news of the capture of Johannes' House had become
known.</p>

<p><q>Get back, my lads—get back quick!</q> shouted
Lawrence through the turret doorway, spotting the
danger at once.</p>

<p>The two men dashed down the stairs, met the rest
of the party coming up, turned them back, and all
rushed helter-skelter out of the house, crossed the
intervening space, and were over the mud wall into
the battery before the hurrying sepoys had an
opportunity of getting a fair shot at them. A few
bullets whistled over their heads, but that was all.</p>

<p>It was a gallant exploit, and Sam Lawrence
obtained the Victoria Cross for his share. The
sortie was not unattended by loss, for one man was
killed in the scrimmage in the lower part of the
house. Unfortunately the building was left stand-
ing. There was not time to blow it up, and it was
speedily occupied by sharpshooters. But there was
no one to replace <q>Bob the Nailer.</q></p>

<p>The party returned triumphant, and Duprat, in
honour of the occasion, brought out half-a-dozen
bottles of champagne. As before, Hawke drank
heavily. The restraint he had put upon himself
once broken down could not be restored in a
moment. He was one of those who could abstain,
but could not be moderate.</p>

<p><q>Haven't you got anything stronger than this,
Duprat, old boy?</q> he exclaimed. <q>What about
that fine cognac of yours, eh?</q></p>

<pb n="198"/>
<p>Duprat had, when the siege began, a stock of
brandy, most of which he had sold in exchange for
valuable gems. Coins were very scarce in the early
days of the trouble in Lucknow, and after the
residents were shut up few had any ready money.
So inside the Residency fortifications gold and
silver became very scarce, and jewels in many cases
were the circulating medium.</p>

<p><q>Very little left,</q> replied Duprat, <q>and I'm not
going to bring it out now. We'll keep the brandy
for the wounded, my boy.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, that's all right. I didn't know how much
you sold. I suppose you made a pretty penny, eh?</q></p>

<p>There was a suspicion of a sneer in Hawke's
voice. Duprat, who was a high-spirited man, flushed
a little angrily.</p>

<p><q>I don't see what business it is of yours, Captain
Hawke. I don't sell my champagne anyhow; you
seem to have forgotten that.</q></p>

<p>The retort went home. Hawke had drunk four
or five times as much as any of the rest. He started
to his feet.</p>

<p>Hawke's hand wandered over his forehead. He
was conscious he had drunk too much, and muttering
incoherently he went out of the house.</p>

<p><q>That sunstroke did the poor fellow no good,</q>
said Lawrence when he was gone. <q>You must make
allowances for that, Duprat. As a rule, Hawke is
quiet and well behaved enough.</q></p>

<p><q>I understand perfectly,</q> said Duprat. <q>It is
a pity. He is a brave man.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes; but a fool when he takes too much. He'd
insult his best friend then.</q></p>

<p>They watched him walking with unsteady gait
<pb n="199"/>
in the direction of Gubbins' garrison, and thought
he was going there; but he did not get as far. He
went into the brigade mess-house, then occupied by
some of the 32nd. The soldiers there saw that he
had been drinking, and envied him.</p>

<p>Some men when they have drunk too much
instinctively seek the society of their inferiors.
Drink invariably lowered Hawke's nature. His
animalism became uppermost. He grew confidential
with the soldiers, and, led on by one or two of the
more cunning of the men, told where he had obtained
the liquor, and expatiated on the quantity left
behind.</p>

<p>A meaning look was exchanged between the
listeners—a look which was to bear fruit within
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Hawke had some tobacco with him, and this he
distributed. While the party were smoking and
telling stories—more or less of the barrack-room
kind—the officer in command entered. He cast
one look round the room, and shouted angrily:</p>

<p><q>Can't you find a better use for your hands than
holding pipes, you lazy scoundrels? Who the devil
is this? Hawke! Upon my honour, it's too bad
of you. There are some men in this room ready
enough to skulk, without any assistance from their
officers.</q></p>

<p><q>What's it matter?</q> growled Hawke, with a
fierce twist of his moustache. <q>We're bound to peg
out—all of us. Who cares whether it's to-day or
to-morrow? Take it easy while we're here.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't be a fool,</q> answered the officer sharply.
<q>You wouldn't talk such nonsense if you were sober.</q></p>

<p>Hawke scowled, but did not look up. The men
<pb n="200"/>
were silent, and their glances wandered from one
officer to another. At last Hawke rose, and held
out his hand. The words of Captain Allison had
sobered him.</p>

<p>Allison turned his back. He had good reason for
being seriously annoyed with Hawke.</p>

<p><q>Is this a cut, Allison?</q> said Hawke sullenly.</p>

<p>Allison was a good-natured fellow. He turned
round after a pause and took the proffered hand.</p>

<p><q>I don't want to say too much before the men,
Jack,</q> he said in a low voice. <q>But, confound it! I
was in the mind to talk to you pretty straight
I've had no end of trouble with my fellows to keep
them in order, and your coming here won't do them
any good.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm awfully sorry, old chap,</q> said Hawke
penitently. <q>Fact is, I've had a drop too much,
and——</q></p>

<p><q>You needn't tell me that,</q> interposed Allison
abruptly. <q>I hope you didn't let out to the men
where you got it?</q></p>

<p><q>Not I,</q> said Hawke.</p>

<p>In saying this he spoke conscientiously; but, as
a matter of fact, he had quite forgotten the conver-
sation he had had with the soldiers.</p>

<p><q>Where are you going?</q></p>

<p><q>The old job—mining.</q></p>

<p><q>Best thing you can do,</q> returned Allison shortly.</p>

<p>Hawke went out, and Allison, after rating the men
severely, despatched them to Anderson's garrison on
the east side of the fortifications, against which at
that moment a severe cannonade was being directed.</p>

<p>When dawn broke the following morning it was
discovered that Duprat's house had been raided, and
<pb n="201"/>
the cellar despoiled of a good quantity of its store
of wine.</p>

<p>By a singular coincidence, also, about a dozen of
the 32nd were gloriously drunk. Allison did not
betray Hawke, but he had little doubt that Jack had
been the connecting link.</p>

<p>On the robbery becoming known to Colonel
Inglis, he ordered the stores to be removed, and
Duprat's house to be turned into a post for purely
defensive purposes. It was no longer tenable for
a residence, owing to the incessant firing poured into
the Cawnpore battery, which it backed, and Duprat
joined Gubbins' garrison.</p>

<p>The Frenchman had served as a Chasseur
d'Afrique in Algeria, and was a jovial, energetic,
vivacious fellow, much liked by everyone.</p>

<p>Duprat possessed a large bore heavy rifle, which he
used with considerable skill, and his energy during
the night alarms, which the enemy constantly prac-
tised on the besieged, amounted to almost drollery.</p>

<p>The mutineers would cluster round the works
surrounding Mr Gubbins' house, shouting what
appeared to be their war-cry—<q>Ali! Ali!</q> oft
repeated, and calling upon each other to advance,
with the words: <q xml:lang="hi">Chulo bahadon!</q> (<q>Advance,
ye brave!</q>)</p>

<p>On these occasions, Duprat, exposing himself
more than was prudent, would yell back defiance at
them at the top of his voice: <q>Come on, ye brave!
ye rascals, cowards, scoundrels!</q> An emphatic
rejoinder which generally provoked a discharge of
musketry and matchlock balls in return.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions he received a musket-
ball full in the face. It did not kill him, and for a
<pb n="202"/>
time it appeared as though he would recover; but it
was not to be, and he shared the fate of many
another gallant fellow.</p>

<p>As a rule, the rebels' batteries were very well
placed, some guns being put in position within sixty
yards of the defences. Where the defenders' artil-
lery could reach the enemy's guns it never failed in
soon silencing them; but the sepoys were so clever
in placing their batteries that oftentimes no gun
from within the walls could be brought to bear upon
them.</p>

<p>Sometimes they kept their gun concealed behind
the corner of a building, ran it out, fired, and im-
mediately retired before the shot could be returned,
the gun being dragged back by ropes.</p>

<p>In other places the gun was kept at the bottom
of an inclined plane, to the top of which it was
dragged to be fired, when the recoil ran it down into
its place again.</p>

<p>They had scores of dodges. All that they were
deficient in was bravery. As soon as the siege
began they commenced making, along such thorough-
fares as were exposed to the fire from the fortifica-
<choice><corr>tions</corr><orig>cations</orig></choice>, screens of wooden palisades placed in a
bank of earth. The roads and passages were every-
where intersected by ditches and trenches.</p>

<p>Their batteries were usually formed of strong
rafters of wood stuck upright and deeply embedded
in the ground, and strengthened and supported by a
bank of earth, a square enclosure being left in the
centre for the muzzle of the cannon.</p>

<p>A large number of their roundshot passed over
the positions at certain points altogether, and
plunged into the buildings occupied by the muti-
<pb n="203"/>
neers themselves on the opposite side. Sometimes,
however, they contrived, by using small charges of
powder, to lob in their shot very cleverly inside the
defences.</p>

<p>But they could not stand shells, and the howitzers
of the besieged at first did great execution, but not
so much afterwards. The reason was the sepoys
dug narrow trenches ten feet deep near their guns,
into which they could at once spring when they
saw a shell approaching.</p>

<p>Within a fortnight after Chinhut the enemy had
established batteries all round the fortifications; but
at the south-west corner, where Mr Gubbins' house
was situated, they for a long time only had one
field-piece, and for this reason Jean and the other
ladies who were with her were comparatively safe,
though they never dared go out by day.</p>

<p>The time went slowly with the poor women, pent
up as they were and utterly ignorant of what was
going on. News, of course, was brought them at
intervals, but there were occasions when they scarcely
cared to know what the besieged and besiegers were
doing. They were only interested in the prospects
of <q>relief.</q> A dull sense of wearisome monotony
oppressed them, maybe partly induced by the never-
ceasing sound of artillery and musketry firing,
which after a while seemed to deaden the brain.</p>

<p>The only occurrences which varied in any way
the usual course of things were the occasional
attacks of the enemy.</p>

<p>There was something very grand and exciting
about these when they suddenly commenced in the
dead of night, or rather, after their commencement,
when the firing was just at its height. The women
<pb n="204"/>
then would jump out of bed and run into the
verandah, and stay there during these attacks, until
sometimes warned back by a stray bullet falling at
their feet, or striking the wall or doorway above
their heads.</p>

<p>The days passed, each adding to the melancholy
list of wounded, dying or dead. During this time
Jean saw nothing of Hawke, and she was glad he
had taken to heart her injunction not to seek to
see her. She felt a meeting would be embarrassing.</p>

<p>The intensity of his passion frightened her, and
at first she felt a vague dread creep over her when
she thought of the incident which had led to his
taking her in his arms. How tightly he had clasped
her, just as though he had made up his mind
nothing but death should part them! Her face
burned when she thought of it. Yet she could not
be angry. Had he not saved her life? Besides, he
committed no crime in loving her.</p>

<p>As time went on, and she saw nothing of him,
her feeling of dread gradually disappeared. She
did not know that scarcely a day passed that he
did not creep to the house and assure himself of her
safety. He had seen her more than once when at
night she came out to take the only exercise she
could venture upon without risk. He tried to be
glad that she had so far escaped injury, but in
reality the sight of her gave him no comfort, it only
fanned the fire of his passion.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the wild tumult of emotion, a
fierce joy filled his heart when he thought that his
rival, the man whom she loved, might never see
her again.</p>

<p><q>If she were killed—yes, if she were killed,</q> he
<pb n="205"/>
muttered, in the anguish of his spirit, <q>it would end
this torture.</q></p>

<p>And then he would curse himself for his wicked-
ness. To die painlessly as many had died in that
terrible time, struck down in a second, was one
thing; to die after hours, and maybe days, of suffer-
ing, another. That might be her fate.</p>

<p><q>Inhuman brute I am,</q> he groaned, <q>to wish her
to endure a single moment of pain!</q></p>

<p>One moonlight night he saw her, motionless and
statuesque, looking to his fervid fancy like an angel
of peace, and he marvelled that the musketry fire,
the boom of the guns, the crash of shot against brick
and stone, and the sharp patter of bullets on wall,
roof, and pavement, did not cease at her presence.</p>

<p>He was hidden in the doorway of a house opposite,
and could watch her without being seen. He was
strangely tempted to speak to her, but a fear re-
strained him—the fear that, if she knew he came
there to watch her, these stolen moments of mingled
pain and pleasure would end.</p>

<p>He always waited till she disappeared, and then,
like a man from whom life had fled, crept back to
some of the mining operations which were always
going on.</p>

<p>The sepoys, although cowardly in direct attack,
and with no stomach for hand-to-hand fighting,
proved themselves able and persevering in the
construction of mines. The skill and science they
showed lent colour to the belief that Europeans with
a knowledge of engineering guided them. Indeed,
had not the garrison possessed engineers of remark-
able ability the repeated attacks of the enemy must
eventually have proved successful.</p>

<pb n="206"/>
<p>Captain Fulton, who constructed and had charge
of the Redan battery, was a host in himself. He
organised a small body of miners, comprising a few
Cornishmen (the 32nd were raised in Cornwall), and
some Sikhs. Fulton would pass whole hours in a
cramped attitude, lying at the end of a narrow
subterranean passage, during the stifling heat of an
Indian July, listening to the enemy's miners coming
nearer and nearer, until their pickaxes actually pierced
the gallery and exposed the disconcerted workmen
to the view and ready pistol of the solitary sentinel.</p>

<p>On this particular moonlight night Hawke walked
straight to the Redan battery. Since the raid upon
the wine stores in Duprat's house he had pulled
himself together, but this was not entirely due
to his own efforts. He might have dropped entirely
into his old ways but for the fact that, after Colonel
Inglis took the precaution of securing Duprat's
stock, anything beyond what was served out by the
commissariat department was difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>But the craving remained with Hawke though he
was unable to satisfy it, and if the opportunity
presented itself there was little doubt he would
break out again. At least, so said those who knew
him best.</p>

<head type="main">A Hot Attack—the Crisis of the Siege</head>

<p>As Hawke entered the timber and mud shelter—it
was little better—of the Redan battery, Captain
Fulton, dusty and grimy, met him.</p>

<p><q>You're just the man I want, Jack,</q> exclaimed
Fulton. <q>Those devils, I am sure, are at work, and
I haven't found out where.</q></p>

<p><q>If you can't discover, Fulton, no one can,</q> said
Hawke.</p>

<p><q>I've been three hours on the watch, and I feel
played out. I want you to take my place, because
you know something of mining. I'd rather not send
a new hand on so important a job.</q></p>

<p>Fulton was quite right. It is not a very easy
matter for one unpractised in the work to reach the
end of a mine where he is to be stationed. The
shaft of a Lucknow mine was generally not less than
twelve feet deep. On reaching the bottom the
sapper had to crawl on his hands and knees till the
narrowing of the passage compelled him to stretch
himself at full length, and he had to wriggle on worm
fashion as best he could.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the end, the sapper remained
perfectly still and would probably hear a faint noise
which, if he were a novice, would, to his inexperienced
and bewildered ear, sound suspicious. Then he
would hastily wriggle out of the mine to report his
<pb n="208"/>
observations, much to the disgust of a more practised
hand, who, of course, would be immediately sent
down, to return with the report that there was
nothing going on. Such noises simply existed in the
imagination.</p>

<p><q>Very well,</q> said Hawke carelessly. <q>How long
is my <q>turn</q> to last?</q></p>

<p><q>I can't give you less than two hours.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, all right. I'm entitled to a drink, I suppose,
before I go on duty?</q></p>

<p><q>You can have a bottle of beer,</q> said Fulton
impatiently; <q>but if I were you I'd have it after-
wards.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes—but you're not me, old fellow. I'll take it
now, please.</q></p>

<p>Some five or ten minutes were over before Hawke
was ready to descend. He had stripped himself to
his shirt and trousers, and had just laid hold of the
rope tied to a beam in the roof, preparatory to
lowering himself, when Lennard hastily entered.</p>

<p><q>I've come straight from Gubbins',</q> said he, with
unwonted excitement in his manner.</p>

<p>Hawke let go the rope and turned towards the
surgeon.</p>

<p><q>What is it?</q> he exclaimed. <q>Has anything
happened to—to any of the women?</q></p>

<p><q>No, thank heaven, they're all safe.</q></p>

<p><q>But you have some news?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. Ungad, Gubbins' messenger, has just come
from Cawnpore. He brings a letter from Colonel
Tytler. Havelock has fought his way to Cawnpore.
He has force enough with him to defeat the rebels.
His troops are crossing the river, and he hopes to be
in Lucknow in five or six days. Think of it!</q></p>

<pb n="209"/>
<p>In a moment all was joy and excitement. The
men shook hands with each other, one or two threw
up their caps, and Fulton shouted a stentorious
hurrah that might have been heard a quarter of a
mile away.</p>

<p>Hawke alone was silent. The intelligence did not
cheer him. It suddenly flashed across his mind that
if the siege were raised, and the defenders rescued,
Jean would be separated from him. His only chance
of gaining her lay in the abnormal circumstances in
which they were placed. The terrors of the situation,
the common danger to which they were exposed, the
suffering and privation, had put all upon an equality.
Even that which divides class from class—money—
was gone.</p>

<p>This was not the worst. The old state of things
restored, once more he would be Jack Hawke the
reprobate, the dissolute fellow with a shady reputa-
tion. A dark cloud stole over his face as he thought
of it.</p>

<p>In the general exultation no one noticed his
abstraction. He stood apart, his arms folded, his
eyes bent on the ground.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lennard was relating to a little crowd
of eager listeners how Ungad had arrived. The
sepoy, with great daring, had, it appeared, penetrated
the lines of the besiegers, and made his way to
Gubbins' house. He was received into a low room
on the ground floor, with a single light, carefully
screened on the farther side lest it should attract the
bullets of the enemy. Here he was surrounded by
the anxious men, while at the farther end were the
indistinct, shadowy forms of the women, who had
stolen from their beds to listen to the glad tidings.
<pb n="210"/>
Welcome as was the news of Havelock's advance,
and the prospect of speedy rescue, it was saddened
by the terrible narrative of the final Cawnpore
tragedy, the massacre of the women and children.
Information of this had been also brought by Ungad.
The women shuddered at the ghastly story, the men
set their teeth and burned for revenge.</p>

<p>It was not until Lennard had finished answering
the questions with which he was plied by his excited
audience that he noticed Hawke. The light from
the hanging lamp fell on his moody face, its heaviness
the more marked by reason of its contrast with the
elation all round. The two friends had not seen each
other for some days—not, indeed, since Lennard's
rejection by Jean.</p>

<p>Lennard held out his hand, and the other took it,
but with no great show of cordiality, and very few
words passed between them. Then Hawke turned
abruptly and, seizing the rope, swung himself into the
black depths of the shaft and was lost to view.</p>

<p>Hawke's two hours' duty over, he came up and
reported himself to Captain Fulton.</p>

<p><q>I don't believe the beggars are mining in that
direction at all,</q> said he.</p>

<p><q>But if they're bent upon doing us any mischief
they must come that way,</q> persisted Fulton.</p>

<p><q>That's true; but why shouldn't they blunder?</q></p>

<p>Fulton was silent for a moment.</p>

<p><q>Hawke,</q> said he, <q>we'll carry that mine some ten
or twelve feet farther.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well.</q></p>

<p><q>And we'll start upon the work at once. The
Pandies will have heard of Havelock's coming, and
they'll strain every nerve to be beforehand with him.</q></p>

<pb n="211"/>
<p>Armed with pick and spade the two men descended
the shaft, and for three hours went steadily at their
task, one breaking down the dry, hard soil, and the
other shovelling the debris to the shaft, where it was
drawn up in buckets by those at the mouth.</p>

<p>When thoroughly exhausted, Captain Fulton gave
the word of command to knock off work. The party
crawled from the mine, and were about to start for
the headquarters of Colonel Inglis when a loud
explosion was heard outside the battery. It was not
the firing of ordnance. No cannon, however large,
would make the same kind of noise. Fulton's ex-
perienced ear told him in a moment what it was.</p>

<p><q>By heavens,</q> he cried, <q>the devils have exploded
a mine!</q></p>

<p>Leaving Hawke in charge of the guard, he ran
across the enclosure to the fortifications, where the
guns were in readiness. He expected to see them
destroyed, and a breach gaping in the earthworks;
but no damage had been done.</p>

<p>In two or three minutes he came running back
excitedly.</p>

<p><q>Come along, my lads!</q> he shouted, <q>to the
battery!</q></p>

<p>In a very few seconds each man was assigned his
post, and, with his musket or rifle thrust through a
loophole, was ready, when the dense smoke should
clear away, to open fire upon the enemy.</p>

<p>The latter, it was clear, had been mining, as Fulton
suspected, with the object of blowing up the Redan.
The rebels had, however, miscalculated the distance,
and, the smoke hindering them from seeing, they
imagined the explosion had been successful in making
a breach in the fortifications. They could be seen in
<pb n="212"/>
all directions advancing to the attack with fixed
bayonets. Little did they expect the reception they
would meet.</p>

<p><q>Steady, boys!</q> cried Fulton, with the light of
battle in his eyes. <q>Now then, let 'em have it!</q></p>

<p>Almost at the same moment the guns in the
battery and every barrel at the loopholes opened fire.
The rebels were taken by surprise, and staggered
back.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they rallied, and again advanced
to the attack, disregarding the fierce fire that made
tremendous havoc in their ranks.</p>

<p>One of their officers was, unlike the majority of
his followers, a brave man. Waving his sword, on
the point of which he had stuck his cap, he shouted:
<q>Come on, my braves!</q> and led his men almost up
to the earthworks.</p>

<p>They were met by a murderous fire; but they
were confident in their numbers, and the gaps in
their ranks were instantly closed up. One man
leaped upon the earthworks, which were not more
than four feet high. He was met by a thrust in the
chest from a bayonet, and rolled back a corpse.
Others succeeded, to meet with a similar fate.</p>

<p>The enemy swarmed, and the sepoy officer who
led the attack saw that his men were gaining the
advantage slightly. With a yell of exultation he
rushed, followed by a fresh batch of reinforcements,
to where the defence seemed weakest.</p>

<p>He made his way straight for Fulton, as though
he knew him to be the leader; but he never reached
the gallant captain of the engineers. At the moment
when Fulton, hardly pressed by three or four fellows,
was almost defenceless against a fresh attack,
<pb n="213"/>
Hawke's sword swept through the air and cut the
man's neck clean through.</p>

<p>The loss of the sepoy leader made the assailants
waver, and, assistance arriving at that moment from
another battery, the rebels were driven back with
great slaughter. A howitzer immediately after
opened upon them with grape, and this completed
their rout.</p>

<p>A more persistent attack upon the fortifications
than this was not made throughout the siege. The
rebels strained every nerve and made a simultaneous
assault on the east and south, but without avail.</p>

<p>One of the bravest bits of work done that day was
at Innes' house. The garrison here consisted only
of twelve men of the 32nd Foot, twelve of the 13th
Native Infantry, and a few non-military official men.
The whole were commanded by Ensign Loughnan,
the plucky young officer who, at the very outbreak
of the Mutiny at Lucknow, saved the treasure.</p>

<p>The explosion of the enemy's mine at the Redan
gave the signal for the attack, and against this
handful of men, cooped up in the weak defences of
Innes' house, the sepoys pressed in large numbers,
and made their way to within ten yards of the
palisade.</p>

<p>A rolling fire sent them back. They came on
again and again and again; but always with the
same result. Loughnan was young in years, but
cool, wary, determined and resolute. Not a shot
was wasted, and at last he forced the enemy to
desist from their attempts to storm the post, and to
content themselves with a heavy musketry fire from
a safe distance.</p>

<p>While these fierce combats were going on at the
<pb n="214"/>
Redan and Innes' house the rebels made a desperate
attempt on their favourite point of attack—the
Cawnpore battery.</p>

<p>The column was led by its standard-bearer, who,
undeterred by the fire from every loophole, jumped
into the battery ditch. But he forgot he had to
reckon with men who never lost their nerve and
precision of aim. A well-directed bullet stopped
his farther progress, and his followers became dis-
heartened and fell back.</p>

<p>Leaving the Cawnpore battery alone, they rushed
northwards to join their comrades, who were making
a determined assault on Anderson's garrison, distant
some two hundred yards from the Cawnpore battery.
The besiegers had provided themselves with scaling-
ladders; but they were as unsuccessful here as else-
where, and, thoroughly dispirited, they retreated,
and did not renew the attack.</p>

<p>It was now two o'clock in the afternoon. Since
an early hour the defenders had been kept at work
at all points. Although everywhere repulsed, the
enemy for two hours after continued to pour in a
heavy fire, and even attempted to effect a lodgment
in one of the brick-built cook-houses close to the
outer defences.</p>

<p>But the real attack was over. Made in great
force, and with considerable resolution, it had been
defeated by the British with a loss of but four killed
and twelve wounded.</p>

<p>As a feat of arms this repulse is scarcely to be
surpassed by any feat in history. After three weeks
of incessant pounding with shot and shell, the enemy
had tried to overwhelm the besieged by an assault
at all points, and had failed signally everywhere.</p>

<pb n="215"/>
<p>Yet the rebels had every advantage. They had
sprung their mine; they had covered the forward
movement of their infantry by a fierce artillery fire;
their infantry had advanced to within a few yards of
the defences, but not a single place had they been
able to penetrate. Had they not miscalculated the
distance of the mine at the Redan the result might
have been very different. As it was, they were
thoroughly disheartened, while the spirits of the
defenders rose in an equal proportion. Well might
they from that day look forward with more hope to
the future.</p>

<pb n="216"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="15">XV</num></head>
<head type="main">The Royal Talisman of Oudh</head>

<p>The failure of the assault had its effect on the
rebels. For two days they scarcely fired a shot.
It was a welcome relief to the sorely tried garrison
to be able to go out into the open without risk.
Even the women took courage and ventured out,
Edith Ross one of the first.</p>

<p>The spaces between the Residency and the various
batteries and fortified buildings showed traces of
the recent conflict. Outside in the battery ditches the
rebels' dead lay in heaps. Inside, here and there,
was the body of a sepoy who had paid for his
temerity with his life.</p>

<p>The sight caused Edith Ross no repugnance.
Like the others, both men and women, she had
become inured to the sight of blood. She was on
her way to the Cawnpore battery, where the fight
had been hottest. Lennard was there, she knew,
and she was anxious to see him.</p>

<p>As she passed an angle of the wall the sound of
a groan made her pause. Then to her amazement
she heard her own name uttered in soft Hindoo
accents. A man was lying grievously wounded.
The film of death was rapidly gathering in his eyes.
She remembered the man. He had been one of
her servants. His right hand was struggling feebly
inside his vest. Just as he extricated his fingers a
<pb n="217"/>
spasm went over his frame. The next moment he
was dead.</p>

<p>At first Mrs Ross imagined he had called to her
by name simply out of recognition. Then she
caught sight of something glittering in the hand
which had been withdrawn from the vest. Instantly
she bent over the body and snatched from his fingers
a piece of gold, fashioned delicately in the shape of
a fish, the eyes formed of rubies.</p>

<p>Mrs Ross at once recognised the ornament. It
was well known throughout Oudh as the symbol
of kingly power, and anciently it was regarded as
a talisman. The person who held it was believed
to be in the confidence of the king, and trusted by
him with important and delicate negotiations. It
was true there were no longer any kings of Oudh,
but the symbol in some curiously subtle way retained
a good deal of its old influence. No doubt it was
in the possession of the man to enable him to travel
unmolested.</p>

<p>As Edith Ross gazed upon the jewelled piece of
precious metal, the spirit of her Eastern ancestors—
ancestors of princely lineage—seemed to animate
her. At that moment—with her lithe, sinuous
frame, her long, rounded, snakelike arms, her olive
complexion, her firmly chiselled lips, just parted
sufficiently to show the small, regular, gleaming
teeth, her burning, passionately sensuous eyes—she
was the embodiment of the East.</p>

<p><q>This man bears a message,</q> she whispered to
herself. <q>But from whom and to whom?</q></p>

<p>Then she saw protruding from his vest the corner
of a letter. The Hindoo was probably trying to
extract this at the moment death overtook him.
<pb n="218"/>
It was strange the man should carry letters openly
when all the messengers to and from the garrison
only ventured to take letters rolled so small they
could swallow them if need be.</p>

<p>However trustworthy a man might be, it was
scarcely possible for him to enter the Residency
position in consequence of the extreme vigilance
of the enemy. Posts had been carefully established
by them in the houses all round, from which strict
watch and lookout were kept. Beyond these, again,
were other posts and pickets; and all the principal
thoroughfares of the cities and suburbs were observed
and all passers-by challenged and examined.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, a service of extreme danger and
difficulty either to leave the position with letters or
to bring letters in, and the only man who had
effected this was Mr Gubbins' scout Ungad.</p>

<p>The despatches delivered and brought by Ungad
were written on small pieces of thin paper, some-
times in Greek characters. They were tightly
rolled up and inserted in a quill, which was then
closed at either end with sealing-wax. Whenever
despatches were found upon any person he was put
to death, and many were kept in confinement on
mere suspicion of their being <q xml:lang="hi">cossids</q> (native
spies.)</p>

<p>But in the case of this man now lying dead there
was, as Mrs Ross, from her acquaintance with the
traditions of the East, well knew, a special reason
why the precautions taken by the rebels did not
concern him. He was protected by the possession
of the golden fish—the royal talisman of Oudh.</p>

<p>Rapidly Mrs Ross pulled out the letters—there
were more than one—and examined them. To her
<pb n="219"/>
surprise she found they were unfastened. The
writing on the envelope was small and delicate—
in the fine Italian sloping hand which ladies affected
in the forties and the fifties. The ink was very
faint.</p>

<p>The woman's eyes glittered as she read the in-
scription, <q>Prince Azimoolah Khan, Hooper's Hotel,
Bond Street.</q></p>

<p><q>Azimoolah Khan! Ah, he has kept his word.
This man comes from him,</q> she cried.</p>

<p>Edith Ross trembled with excitement—so much
so she could scarcely withdraw the letters from their
envelopes.</p>

<p>Eagerly she perused the contents. One was an
invitation of Lady Constance Harwood, anxious to
secure the presence of Prince Azimoolah at her ball,
at which a lovely young debutante would be present.
<q>Jean Atherton is a most charming and accomplished
girl,</q> wrote the lady, <q>and as she is shortly to pro-
ceed to Lucknow to join her father, she will possess
an additional attraction in your eyes.</q></p>

<p>Mrs Ross's dark eyes blazed. This was better
than she expected.</p>

<p>She opened the second letter and read it eagerly
It was clear Azimoolah had accepted the invitation
had seen Jean Atherton, and had been greatly taken
with her.</p>

<p><q>I was glad,</q> wrote Lady Constance, in her second
letter, <q>to read your enthusiastic letter. Your
admiration of English beauty is so different from
that of our cold-blooded countrymen. I understand
you intend to return to India soon. What a pity
Jean can't hasten her arrangements so that you
might travel together. You say she was very nice
<pb n="220"/>
to you. How encouraging! I think you are to be
envied, my dear Prince, on your conquest.</q></p>

<p>The letter then went into trivialities which need
not be given.</p>

<p>Then came the letter in which Lady Constance
suggested Azimoolah should join Jean at Cairo.</p>

<p><q>Ah, Miss Atherton!</q> hissed the woman. <q>I
have you completely in my power. So you were
nice to the <q>Prince</q>! Nice to an ex-<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign> of
low birth! Oh, you'll have to be very ingenious to
explain that away. If I could only discover whether
Azimoolah did join you at Cairo. Anyhow, he made
a <q>conquest</q> of you, did he.</q></p>

<p>Lady Constance Harwood's use of the word
<q>conquest</q> was horribly unjust, but she had a
motive. She wanted to flatter Azimoolah Khan for
her own personal gain. She little thought, of course,
the letter would fall into the hands of Jean's bitterest
enemy.</p>

<p>Edith Ross's object in bargaining with Azimoolah
was perfectly plain. She thought if she could once
get hold of these letters, she could destroy Hawke's
belief in Jean's purity and innocence.</p>

<p>Mrs Ross knew—no one better—what was going
on in Hawke's mind. Hawke had the notion which
sometimes, in his moments of repentance, comes to
the most hardened reprobate, that if he could meet
the true, pure, devoted, sympathetic woman of his
youthful dreams, it would be an easy matter, through
her influence, to cast off his evil ways. The injustice
of imposing the task of their reformation on the
imaginary good angel does not seem to occur to these
prodigal sons.</p>

<p>Hawke, like many another man from Adam down-
<pb n="221"/>
wards, attributed his ruin to the influence of women
—the women who play with men's hearts as if they
were toys. He had told Edith Ross so more than
once. She met him with ironical laughter, but all
the same remembered his words.</p>

<p>She knew well enough that Jean's attraction in
Hawke's eyes was the contrast she presented to
herself.</p>

<p><q>I've but to show Jack that the girl's in no way
different from me, and his illusion is dispelled at
a blow.</q></p>

<p>She folded the letters, and was about to place
them with the golden fish in her pocket, when she
paused. She meant both Lennard and Hawke to
see the letters, but it would be much better for
Lennard to find them. He might not believe her
story how they came into her possession.</p>

<p>Thrusting back the letters within the man's vest,
she retained the golden fish and hastened to the
Cawnpore battery. The officer in command was
amazed to see her. Throughout the whole of the
siege, never had a woman come to the battery.</p>

<p><q>You, Mrs Ross?</q> he exclaimed. <q>How terribly
rash!</q></p>

<p><q>Is it? One place is as safe or as unsafe as another,
Captain Saltmarsh. Is Dr Lennard here?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. I'll fetch him for you.</q></p>

<p>The inquiry for Lennard explained everything.
No doubt the doctor was wanted urgently elsewhere.
Saltmarsh returned in a couple of minutes with
Ernest Lennard.</p>

<p><q>What's the matter?</q> cried the latter, a little agi-
tatedly. The thought crossed his mind that Jean was
ill, or worse—wounded. Mrs Ross read his thoughts.</p>

<pb n="222"/>
<p><q>Don't be alarmed,</q> said she, with a cold smile.
<q>It's nothing very serious, and nothing that con-
cerns you. A puzzle—that's all. You've seen some-
thing like this before, haven't you?</q></p>

<p>She held out the golden fish.</p>

<p><q>Yes, certainly. It is the sign of one whom we
should call in England a Queen's Messenger.</q></p>

<p><q>Exactly. The man who was carrying it is lying
at death's door. He was holding up the fish to me
as I passed. I didn't stay to inquire what he had to
say, but ran to you with the sign. You'd better come.</q></p>

<p>Lennard knew the importance of the symbol of the
fish. He accompanied Mrs Ross to where the man
was lying.</p>

<p><q>I can do nothing,</q> said he quickly. <q>The fellow
was doubtless a spy. And——</q></p>

<p>Lennard caught sight of the letters, purposely placed
by Mrs Ross so that he should see them. Instantly
they were in his hand, and he was reading the name
and address on one of the envelopes.</p>

<p><q>Prince Azimoolah Khan!</q> he cried angrily.
<q>What prince? The detestable rascal who is the
right hand of that monster Nana Sahib is no prince.
<q>Hooper's Hotel</q>! I don't see what it means.
How comes this man to have these letters in his
possession?</q></p>

<p><q>Don't you think they have been entrusted to him
by Azimoolah?</q> suggested Mrs Ross, her eyes bent
down. <q>For what purpose, who can say? But why
not read the letters?</q></p>

<p>Lennard hesitated—he knew not why. He had a
strange reluctance. He would much prefer to place
the letters unread in the hands of Colonel Inglis, and
he said so.</p>

<pb n="223"/>
<p>But this did not suit the ideas of Mrs Ross.
Colonel Inglis might keep the contents to himself,
and this she did not want.</p>

<p><q>What nonsense!</q> she exclaimed brusquely.
<q>The envelopes are unfastened. It's not as if they
were sealed. There may be something inside which
demands instant action. How can you tell? Our
desperate condition warrants anything. If you have
any scruples about reading them I haven't.</q></p>

<p>And hastily she snatched the letter from Lennard's
hand, and pretended to read it.</p>

<p><q>It contains nothing of importance. Simply a
woman's letter. Read it for yourself while I look at
the others.</q></p>

<p>She handed it back. Mechanically Lennard cast
his eye over the contents, unconscious that Mrs Ross,
while apparently looking at one of the other letters,
was keenly watching his face.</p>

<p><q>Did you see this?</q> he cried suddenly.</p>

<p><q>See what?</q></p>

<p><q>The reference to Miss Atherton. It's incredible
she can have made the acquaintance of that scoundrel
Azimoolah!</q></p>

<p><q>You astonish me. I was nervous and anxious
I confess, and didn't read the letter attentively
Why——</q> and the woman gave an admirably simulated
start of surprise—<q>her name is mentioned here too.
There seems to have been some arrangement by
which in her journey out here Miss Atherton was to
be joined at Cairo by Azimoolah.</q></p>

<p>This was a grossly unfair interpretation of the
letter. But it was Mrs Ross's desire to suggest a line
of thought in Lennard's mind. She knew the im-
portance of little inaccuracies.</p>

<pb n="224"/>
<p><q>Of course there mayn't be much in it, but anyway
I shouldn't like to have my name connected in this
intimate fashion with that of such an infamous
creature as Azimoolah Khan.</q></p>

<p>Lennard frowned. The manner even more than
the words of Mrs Ross jarred horribly upon him.</p>

<p><q>There's no reflection upon Miss Atherton in these
letters,</q> said he impatiently.</p>

<p><q>Oh, none at all, unless—unless she met Azimoolah
at Cairo.</q></p>

<p>Mrs Ross dropped out her words hesitatingly, as
though she were anxious to defend Jean, while
launching insinuations against her.</p>

<p><q>And supposing she did?</q> cried Lennard angrily.
<q>She couldn't prevent him joining the steamer at
Cairo, I presume. Besides, at that time Azimoolah
had not exhibited himself in his true colours. He
had passed himself off as a prince, and had deceived
many people in England who ought to have known
better—particularly the lady who writes these letters,
and who is responsible for introducing him to Jean.
It sounds very horrible now, of course; but at that
time there was nothing in the introduction, especially
as Azimoolah had all the plausibility necessary to
deceive the unsuspecting.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> said Mrs Ross, with half a sigh, <q>that's the
worst of it. The fellow's so clever and fascinating,
and girls are impulsive, and fond of admiration.</q></p>

<p><q>What has that to do with Miss Atherton?</q>
cried Lennard angrily. But he winced nevertheless.
Every phrase Mrs Ross let fall seemed to have poison
in it.</p>

<p><q>Oh, nothing, of course. It's odd, though, Lady
Constance Harwood should have used the word
<pb n="225"/>
<q>conquest.</q> That looks as if he had made some
impression on Jean, doesn't it?</q></p>

<p>Lennard did not reply. The discovery that Jean
was acquainted with the detestable Azimoolah was
rankling. Mrs Ross continued to add fuel to the fire.</p>

<p><q>The question, after all,</q> said she, <q>is what
brought the native here? I wonder whether he has
a letter addressed to anybody in the Residency. If
not, it's curious he should have Azimoolah's letters in
his possession. Of course Azimoolah may have for
some purpose entrusted them to him, but——</q></p>

<p><q>More likely he has met Azimoolah in battle,
killed the rascal, and found the letters on him,</q>
broke in Lennard.</p>

<p><q>I don't think that at all,</q> answered Mrs Ross
quickly. <q>The death of so important a man would
be known at once. We should have heard it through
our own Sikhs.</q></p>

<p>It is a curious fact that throughout the siege
the Sikhs, of whom a number remained faithful to
us, were always the first to learn the news of any-
thing going on outside. No doubt they had friends
outside with whom they in some sort held com-
munication. These friends must have been staunch.
It is certain they never betrayed to the rebel sepoys
the real condition of the garrisons.</p>

<p><q>Well, while the man cannot speak it's useless
to discuss the question,</q> retorted Lennard. <q>In the
meantime, I shall hold to my theory that——</q></p>

<p>He stopped and turned. He could hear footsteps.
Mrs Ross heard them also, and her face lighted up.
Hawke and Fulton were approaching.</p>

<p><q>I'm glad to see Captain Fulton,</q> whispered Mrs
Ross to Lennard. <q>He'll have to take the responsi-
<pb n="226"/>
bility of this painful business. I'm sorry for Miss
Atherton, but she has only herself to blame. Captain
Fulton will have to decide if this man is a spy.</q></p>

<p>Lennard turned from Edith Ross with irritation.
Her continual reference to Jean annoyed him. It
looked remarkably like malice. He went towards
Fulton and told him what had happened. He
would have liked to take Fulton apart so that
Hawke should not hear, but this would only have
excited Hawke's suspicions. Hawke said not a
word while the two were talking.</p>

<p><q>Have you read the letters?</q> asked Fulton.</p>

<p><q>Yes. The envelopes were not sealed. I may
say that they were written in England some months
ago, on private matters,</q> returned Lennard, in a
somewhat embarrassed way. <q>I am bound to give
them to you, but I do so only on the condition that
they're handed over to the person concerned. I
pledge you to secrecy, Fulton.</q></p>

<p>Before Fulton could answer, Mrs Ross interposed.
Secrecy was the last thing she wanted.</p>

<p><q>What nonsense, Dr Lennard. I've read the
letters also, and I say emphatically there's nothing
in them to demand secrecy.</q></p>

<p><q>I beg to differ from you, Mrs Ross,</q> retorted
Lennard.</p>

<p><q>I quite understand your desire to protect <q>the
person concerned,</q> to quote your own words. But
surely I'm right in thinking that anything relating
to Azimoolah Khan must be of importance.</q></p>

<p>The bomb exploded, as Edith Ross meant it
should. Hawke started, and he was about to utter
some violent ejaculations expressive of his senti-
ments towards Azimoolah, but was restrained by a
<pb n="227"/>
warning look from Mrs Ross. She bent forward
and whispered rapidly:</p>

<p><q>You'd better clear out, Jack, before you hear
something you won't like. Take my advice. I'm
speaking for the sake of your own peace of mind.</q></p>

<p>She couldn't have said anything better calculated
to detain him.</p>

<p><q>My peace of mind,</q> he returned, with a shrug
of the shoulders. <q>How considerate! Quite re-
freshing—from you.</q></p>

<p>Hawke turned abruptly. Fulton was speaking.</p>

<p><q>Is it true, Lennard, that these letters are ad-
dressed to Azimoolah Khan?</q> said he.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> answered Lennard, intensely vexed at
Mrs Ross's persistency, the reason of which he
could not understand. <q>It's true; but, as I've
already said, the letters were written months before
the Mutiny broke out.</q></p>

<p><q>I must see the letters before I bind myself to
anything,</q> said Fulton. <q>You've no object in keep-
ing their contents to yourself, I suppose?</q></p>

<p><q>No, except—well, to be quite frank with you,
I <emph>have</emph> an objection. In the letters the name of a
lady now within the Residency is mentioned. I had
a reluctance in handing them over to you on ac-
count of that circumstance. But you're a gentleman,
Fulton. Take the letters. I trust to your honour
to let no eye but yours—Colonel Inglis' excepted—
rest upon them.</q></p>

<p><q>I appreciate your delicacy, Lennard,</q> said Fulton
gravely; <q>but, as I said before, until I see what the
letters are about, I can make no promise. My duty in
regard to the safety of the garrison is above everything.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, yes, I know that,</q> said Lennard. <q>When
<pb n="228"/>
you've read the letters, I think you'll agree with me
that my request isn't an unreasonable one.</q></p>

<p>Hawke, who had been gradually working himself
into a ferment, broke out at this point.</p>

<p><q>Do you include me in the outside mob who are
not to be allowed to look upon these sacred
epistles?</q> he exclaimed furiously.</p>

<p><q>I would rather you didn't,</q> said Lennard.</p>

<p><q>But I tell you I've a right! Do you know who
this unhanged rascal Azimoolah Khan really is?
Do you know that he was once in my service, and
that if he hadn't cleared out in a hurry I'd have
broken every bone in his body?</q></p>

<p>This was news to Lennard, and uncomfortable
news, too. It made his objection to Hawke reading
the letters all the more forcible.</p>

<p><q>I wasn't aware of it, Jack,</q> said he; <q>but, allowing
it to be true, I don't see it makes any difference.</q></p>

<p>All this while Fulton had been reading the letters,
and had paid no attention to what was going on
between Lennard and Hawke.</p>

<p><q>You're quite right, Lennard,</q> said he. <q>These
letters tell us nothing. They are absolutely trivial,
save that they throw a little light on the scoundrel's
doings in London. I quite agree with you it would
be extremely unpleasant for the lady whose name
is mentioned to have it known that she was once
on terms of friendship with the atrocious ruffian for
whose head I'd willingly give a year's pay out of
my own pocket. This unlucky acquaintance doesn't
really touch the lady in the least, but you know
what a hotbed of gossip and scandal we live in.
Even now, when the houses are almost tumbling
about our ears with shot and shell, the women
<pb n="229"/>
must talk just in the old style. I'd like to suggest
a new reading of a familiar line, and say that Satan
finds some evil things for idle tongues to say.</q></p>

<p><q>Then you're of opinion that no notice need be
taken of these letters?</q> said Lennard eagerly.</p>

<p><q>No, I don't say that. We must have the body
searched. There may be something else we shall
find to throw a light on the matter.</q></p>

<p><q>In the meantime, Fulton,</q> broke in Hawke, <q>if
the letters are innocent, there's no reason why I
shouldn't look at them, considering that I know
more about that scoundrel Azimoolah than anybody
else in the Residency.</q></p>

<p><q>For the life of me I can't see the objection,</q> said
Fulton, <q>providing you undertake as I do to be
silent as to the lady referred to.</q></p>

<p><q>There's no need for me to give any undertaking.
It's almost an insult to require one,</q> was Hawke's
answer.</p>

<p>Lennard saw the uselessness of further protest.
He had done his best and had failed. Events must
take their course. Fulton handed the letters to
Hawke. The latter began to read.</p>

<p>Lennard expected an explosion. A dead silence
followed instead. But it was clear Hawke was
intensely moved. His face was white, his lips
bloodless. The hand that held the paper trembled
slightly. He nerved himself, and, folding the letters,
handed them to Fulton, and with a characteristic
swing of his broad shoulders strode away. Mrs
Ross followed him.</p>

<p>Fulton put the letters and the jewelled fish in his
pocket, and, asking Lennard to accompany him, the
two went off to Colonel Inglis to report the affair.</p>

<pb n="230"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="16">XVI</num></head>
<head type="main">Jean Atherton's Daring</head>

<p>Jack Hawke, mad with rage, to which he surrendered
himself in his rough animal fashion without the least
attempt at self-control, made his way towards Dr
Fayrer's house. He thought he was alone, and he
cursed himself aloud. Mrs Ross, following him
cautiously, heard every word.</p>

<p>She knew Hawke's impulsive, ungovernable nature
thoroughly. The tempest would be succeeded by a
period of depression. Then would be her time to
exercise her influence. Hidden by a heap of debris
close to the verandah of the main building, or,
rather, what had been the verandah—it was now a
ruin—she waited quietly.</p>

<p>Hawke walked to and fro for ten minutes or so,
like some unquiet animal, and then sat down on a
big stone, his passion exhausted, his elbows resting
on his knees, his forehead buried in his hands.
Edith Ross stole forward and laid her hand lightly
on his shoulder. He started and looked up.</p>

<p><q>Go away,</q> said he harshly. <q>I'm in no mood to
listen to your song of triumph. Leave me to myself.</q></p>

<p>And again he plunged his head in his hands.
Mrs Ross laughed silently. The torture of this big
helpless man was to her a secret joy. But she had
no intention of triumphing over him, outwardly at
least.</p>

<pb n="231"/>
<p><q>Poor Jack!</q> said she softly. <q>I'm awfully sorry
for you.</q></p>

<p><q>Keep your sorrow to yourself. I don't want it.
I'm going to ferret out the truth of this business.
No beating about the bush for me. I'll go straight
to Miss Atherton and——</q></p>

<p><q>You great fool!</q> interposed Mrs Ross. <q>As if
you were likely to obtain any information that
way.</q></p>

<p><q>How then? Why don't you talk sense?</q></p>

<p>Hawke's passion was rising again. The woman's
jealousy and spite were also in the ascendant.</p>

<p><q>I'll try,</q> she returned sarcastically. <q>What shall
I say? That Jean Atherton has a right to love any-
one she likes? That she's quite free to bestow her
heart on Azimoolah Khan if she chooses?</q></p>

<p><q>By God—I tell you it's not true!</q></p>

<p><q>My dear Jack, anybody but you would see at
once that these letters solve the mystery, and ought
to put you out of your misery.</q></p>

<p>He shook her touch from his arm roughly, and
stared at her.</p>

<p><q>Solve the mystery?</q> he repeated wildly.</p>

<p><q>Yes. No doubt Azimoolah made the running
when he was in London, and you can depend upon
it he joined her at Cairo, and they came on together
to Calcutta. Jack, you may lay your life that your
rival is your old servant, the wily, unscrupulous,
bloodthirsty, fascinating Azimoolah Khan. Poor
Jack!</q></p>

<p>She threw back her head slightly, and, looking
into his bloodshot eyes, a soft, low ripple of laughter
escaped her lips.</p>

<p><q>Go on. Laugh away,</q> exclaimed Hawke savagely.
<pb n="232"/>
<q>It'll make no difference to me. I'm going to hear
the story from Jean's own lips.</q></p>

<p><q>Jack,</q> said Mrs Ross sarcastically, <q>you're a
fool if you imagine you'll get at the truth that
way. What right have you to cross-question Miss
Atherton?</q></p>

<p>At that moment a roundshot, evidently fired into
the air, descended about the centre of the interven-
ing space between the Begum Kothee and Dr
Fayrer's house, and ploughed up the soft ground,
spattering them both with earth.</p>

<p>The rebels were evidently recovering from their
defeat. The bombardment was about to recommence.</p>

<p>Her narrow escape from death shook the nerves
of Edith Ross a little, and, trembling violently, she
leaned against the woodwork of the verandah.</p>

<p>It was well she did so, for the shot was followed
by a hot musketry fire, which swept over the com-
pound like hail.</p>

<p><q>By Jove!</q> shouted Hawke. <q>What does that
mean?</q></p>

<p>His voice was almost inaudible in the discharge of
cannon. Evidently the rebels had opened a new
battery. The shot from this battery was a new
departure for the enemy. Hitherto their gun practice
had been very bad. Indeed, they never, except at
the end of the siege, possessed an effective battery
or maintained a continuous fire, or attempted to breach
the defences with their artillery.</p>

<p>They kept their guns in isolated and sheltered
nooks and fired them at random, hitting mainly the
upper parts of the buildings and defences, their shots
going in large numbers clean over the entrenchments,
and plunging into their own posts beyond.</p>

<pb n="233"/>

<p>Besides these fixed guns they had two good light
field-batteries of twelve guns, and the terrible eight-
inch howitzer. These they moved about from place
to place, and used when the desire seized them. Their
stores of ammunition for these guns were small, and
after a while they had no shells to use for the howitzer
except those that, thrown from the Residency mortars,
had failed to burst.</p>

<p>But this gun which caused Mrs Ross so much
alarm was of a different make altogether. It was a
heavy gun, planted in the street leading southward
from the iron bridge, in a place where it could range
in a diagonal line through the centre of the Residency
positions. It was, in fact, the only gun that did
serious harm, and the first time it was fired was on
the occasion just mentioned.</p>

<p>It was subsequently the cause of much damage,
and the shot generally hit Innes' post (its nearest
object), the Residency, Dr Fayrer's house, or the
post-office.</p>

<p>It did the most mischief at the Residency. One
case there, as General Innes has recorded, was very
singular. The shot, making its way into one of the
rooms, caught the end of the punkah fringe, tore
down most of it, was checked while doing so, and
then, getting a circular motion, whirled round a young
officer of the 32nd, its eventual impact breaking his
leg and causing his death.</p>

<p>At the post-office it played pranks and did serious
damage. One of its shots broke the leg of a chair on
which a lady was sitting, brought her to the ground,
got caught in her dress, and then unrolled itself out
and along the floor without doing her further harm.
Another grazed the forehead—or rather the temples—
<pb n="234"/>
of a young engineer as he lay asleep, breaking the
skin, and plunging against a treasure-chest beyond,
but doing no further harm, while one cut through the
pillows on which an officer of the 1st Fusiliers was
lying asleep, and then broke the leg of the bedstead
next him.</p>

<p>No wonder the shot coming in a direction quite
unprecedented puzzled Jack Hawke. Hitherto the
space between the Begum Kothee and Dr Fayrer's
house had been comparatively safe, excepting when
the sepoys directed a musketry fire towards it.</p>

<p>A bullet had struck the verandah a foot from where
they were standing, and was flattened out against the
woodwork.</p>

<p>At this they hastened inside the house, where all
was excitement. Hitherto Dr Fayrer's house had
escaped damage from the heavy guns. It was a new
experience for the inmates to find it bombarded. One
of the shots from the enemy's new battery had already
struck the corner, and brought down a quantity of the
stonework, though it had not penetrated the building.</p>

<p>For some days past the mutineers had been depend-
ing chiefly on their muskets. Apparently their supply
of shot had dwindled, and they had been firing all
kinds of queer missiles, not infrequently logs of wood
shod with iron. It was clear their stock had been
replenished from some source. It was now round-
shot that at intervals struck the house, smashing
through brick and stone, and shaking it to its founda-
tions.</p>

<p>Edith Ross and Jack Hawke were but half way
across the entrance hall when they heard a hurried
footstep behind. Lennard, panting with running,
joined them. The word had been sent for help. He
<pb n="235"/>
and Fulton had been met on their way to Colonel
Inglis, and the surgeon had turned back to take his
place with the rest.</p>

<p><q>Look sharp, Hawke!</q> he shouted. <q>We haven't
too many men to keep those devils at bay!</q></p>

<p>Lennard was quite right. But the defenders were
not dismayed. At every available loophole a man
was posted, and rarely was a shot wasted. Hawke
quitting Mrs Ross, who remained below with the
other women, hastened to the top of the house and
took his stand in a sort of turret at one of the
angles of the building. It was an exposed position,
but it had the advantage of commanding the battery
of the enemy. His first shot brought down one of
the sepoy gunners.</p>

<p>He had fired only half-a-dozen times, when he was
joined by a private of the 32nd, an Irishman.</p>

<p><q>Dr Lennard, sir, wants to know if you've any
cartridges to spare.</q></p>

<p><q>I've no more than I can get rid of. You're not
short of ammunition are you, Moloney?</q></p>

<p><q>Begorrah, sir, we are thot!</q></p>

<p><q>The devil! Send to the next garrison for some.
I want all I've got. The beggars haven't been able
to fire their gun since I've been here. I must keep
them in check.</q></p>

<p><q>Faith, you're right, sir!</q></p>

<p>Away went the private with the message to
Lennard.</p>

<p><q>One of us must go across to the Begum Kothee!</q>
exclaimed the surgeon. <q>It's the nearest house.</q></p>

<p><q>Oi'll do it, sir,</q> said Moloney.</p>

<p><q>You're a brave fellow, Moloney. Go, and good
luck go with you.</q></p>

<pb n="236"/>
<p>Moloney went into the verandah and looked across
to the Begum Kothee. He had a terribly dangerous
task before him. Bullets were whistling in all direc-
tions. He hesitated, and no wonder.</p>

<p><q>Bedad! the longer Oi look at it the less Oi like
it,</q> he muttered. <q>Here goes!</q></p>

<p>Ducking his head, he ran in a crouching attitude
over the ground. He was untouched until he arrived
within a couple of yards of the Begum Kothee.
Here a bullet struck him in the knee. Even then he
was undaunted, for he hopped the remainder of the
distance, and fell within the portico, sick with the ex-
cruciating pain. He yelled for the door to be opened.</p>

<p>His fear was lest he should not be heard, and his
journey prove to be in vain. The plucky fellow never
thought about help for himself.</p>

<p>His shouts might have been disregarded had
not Jean chanced to be in the lower part of the
house. The rest of the occupants were on the flat
roof, which was protected by a timber palisading,
through the loopholes of which they were firing.
They dared not show their heads above the wood-
work, and so Moloney had not been observed.</p>

<p><q>What is it, my good fellow?</q> cried the girl.
<q>You're wounded.</q></p>

<p><q>Faith, miss, it's nothing to trouble about. It's
the cartridges Oi'm wanting. Oi've come from the
docthor's house yonder. The bhoys are hard
pressed, an' soon there won't be a blessed cartridge
to lay their hands upon. For the love of heaven,
miss, tell the captain. Don't mind me—Oi can crawl
inside.</q></p>

<p>There was no time for delay. Even had there
been time, it occurred to Jean that the captain in
<pb n="237"/>
command of the post might hesitate about sending
a man away, for she knew how strict were the
regulations.</p>

<p>The defence of the Residency was unlike any
other, not only in the number of separate garrisons,
but in the fact that these garrisons were never
relieved, because there were no men to relieve them.
The only man who quitted his post was the man
who went in the morning to fetch the day's rations.
It was thoroughly understood by all that there was
no retreat; that all must die at their posts; and
that, whatever casualties might occur, vacant places
could not be filled.</p>

<p>A daring idea flashed through the girl's mind. She
knew where the ammunition was stored. She would
take the cartridges to the beleaguered post herself.</p>

<p><q>Yes, yes,</q> she exclaimed rapidly, <q>crawl inside.</q>
Turning, she vanished.</p>

<p>In two or three minutes she reappeared, bearing
in her arms a bag which she had filled with as many
cartridges as she could carry.</p>

<p>Moloney, as brave as a lion where his own body
was concerned, was terror-stricken when he saw this
slim, delicate girl staggering under her burden. He
guessed her intention.</p>

<p><q>No, no, miss—you sha'n't! It's meself that'll
thry and creep across.</q></p>

<p>He made an effort to rise, but his knee was
shattered. He sank back groaning.</p>

<p><q>A man can't be spared,</q> she said swiftly. <q>If
I'm killed—well, it doesn't much matter.</q></p>

<p>The next moment she plunged into the path of
death, and in the few moments she took to cross, the
soldier, in watching her, forgot his pain.</p>

<pb n="238"/>
<p>By a miracle she arrived in safety. But the strain
on her nerves was terrible. She tottered across the
verandah, and sank down within the doorway. The
next moment Lennard's arms were round her.
Anxious about Moloney's mission, he had, when the
man started, handed his gun to his nearest neigh-
bour and left his post for a few minutes while he
watched the soldier run through the storm of bullets.
He saw him fall, and witnessed the appearance of
Jean on the scene; but never could he have imagined
that she would be the return messenger.</p>

<p>He was horror-stricken at the sight, the more so
as he was powerless to assist her. He shouted
frantically, but in vain. His voice was drowned by
the noise of the firing.</p>

<p>When Lennard ran forward to meet Jean, and she
fell into his arms, he at first thought she was wounded;
but her unconsciousness was only momentary, and
her first words were to assure him she was unhurt.</p>

<p><q>Thank heaven!</q> he cried. <q>There's no one in the
whole garrison braver than you, Jean. You deserve
the Victoria Cross for this.</q></p>

<p>She smiled faintly.</p>

<p><q>I'm afraid there was more desperation than
courage. If I'd stopped to think I should never
have done it.</q></p>

<p>Lennard lifted the bag, and was amazed at its
weight. The urgency of the occasion had lent
unnatural strength to the girl. No wonder she was
exhausted at the end of the journey.</p>

<p>The joy of the little garrison was intense at the
arrival of the supply of cartridges; and when Lennard
led Jean forward, and told how she had daringly run
the gauntlet of fire, a loud cheer burst from the men.</p>

<head type="main">The Craft of Mrs Ross</head>

<p>Meanwhile Hawke, in the upper room, and the rest
of the men were busy at their posts. Each man had
three muskets, and these were loaded for them by
the women or by the inferior marksmen.</p>

<p>This loophole warfare had grown to be quite an
art. One of the peculiarities of the siege was that
the assailants and the assailed were quite close
together. The distance which separated them was
in many points not greater than the average width
of a street such as Fleet Street. No man on either
side dared, therefore, expose himself in the open to
discharge his musket. Every loophole was a target,
and within the Residency houses care was taken in
boring a loophole that the background should be
dark, so that it should not betray its presence to the
enemy, because, the hostile parties being so close
together, it was sometimes easy to discover the bear-
ings of particular loopholes and avoid them.</p>

<p>The object of the besieging sepoys was to find
out points not commanded by the loopholes of the
besieged, and here they posted men to fire on any
defender who might incautiously show himself.
After a while the garrisons came to understand
these tactics, and were quite equal to them.</p>

<p>First of all the besieged would encourage the
assailants to occupy such a point, and have confidence
<pb n="240"/>
in it. The new position was noted accurately, and
in the night holes were bored in that particular
direction. In the morning the enemy would come
up by twos and threes to occupy their chosen post,
or the garrison would do something to attract them
there. Then the muskets would be discharged from
the new loopholes. This method of outwitting the
enemy was tried again and again, and generally with
success.</p>

<p>Captain Fulton was one whom the enemy had
reason to fear most. He was a crack shot, and if
the enemy had been worrying any particular post
he would go there and fire several rounds into the
opposite line of loopholes. The lesson was always
effectual.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the siege the officers
and men fired continuously and recklessly; but at
the end of about ten days they found out that this
was a mistake. The fatigue was not only very great,
but the continuous recoil of the piece made the men's
shoulders sore and painful. After this they became
sparing of their shots, and no one fired unless he
could cover a foe.</p>

<p>The curious effect of this economy of force was
that nothing tended to daunt the enemy more than
the perfect stillness which used to prevail in the
entrenchments during the night.</p>

<p>The insistence of loophole firing, the stern sup-
pression of needless exposures and aimless sorties,
the enforced restriction of the men to the posts to
which they belonged, and the stoppage of all un-
authorised wandering over the more open and
exposed positions, account for the astonishingly
small number of casualties during the siege, when
<pb n="241"/>
the almost ceaseless fire of the enemy and the actual
encounters with them are remembered.</p>

<p>For three days it was impossible to stir from Dr
Fayrer's house, the firing was so incessant. Jean
had, of course, to remain where she was. The
women were kept so busy, she and Mrs Ross had
not met. They were stationed in different rooms.</p>

<p>During those three days, Mrs Ross had been load-
ing for the captain of the post, but at length the
enemy's fire slackened, and she was released from
her duty. Of course she had heard of Jean's arrival
and daring exploit, and she at once sought the girl,
for she could now put into execution her scheme of
finding out the extent of her acquaintance with
Azimoolah Khan.</p>

<p>Jean was sitting by one of the ladies. Edith Ross
softly approached, and took a vacant seat by her
side. Edith sat listening quietly, and, when there
was a pause in the conversation, congratulated Jean
in silken tones on her courage in carrying the am-
munition under fire, adding, <q>There's not another
woman in the garrison who would have dared to do
such a thing.</q></p>

<p><q>I think you're wrong,</q> said Jean emphatically.
<q>There are plenty, I'm sure, who would have done
the same had they been in my place.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, I couldn't.</q></p>

<p><q>And yet I've heard Dr Macpherson say you've
wonderful nerve.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, in hospital cases. That's a different matter.
I'm in no danger there. Talking of patients, you
haven't inquired after my latest.</q></p>

<p><q>Who is he?</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, I forgot. You know nothing of what has
<pb n="242"/>
taken place here, although we're so very few yards
apart.</q></p>

<p><q>You mean the man they call the spy, don't you,
Mrs Ross?</q> said the lady to whom Jean had been
talking.</p>

<p><q>Yes. I called him a patient just now, but that
isn't quite correct. The man died before I could get
Dr Lennard. If he wasn't a patient it's pretty
certain he was a spy—and a spy in the service of
Azimoolah Khan.</q></p>

<p><q>Azimoolah Khan,</q> cried Jean, starting.</p>

<p><q>Ah, I thought the name would be familiar to
you,</q> said Mrs Ross, suddenly dropping her voice
so that Jean alone heard her words. <q>I've some-
thing to say to you, dear, but I don't want to talk
before all these people. I'm going into the next
room. Will you follow me shortly?</q></p>

<p>Jean's dark eyes looked at the woman troublously.
What could she have to say that demanded so much
mystery?</p>

<p>When they again met, Mrs Ross's gaze was bent
on the floor, as if she were pondering something.
She seemed to be unconscious of Jean's presence.</p>

<p><q>What is it you wish to say to me?</q> asked Jean.</p>

<p><q>I spoke to you just now of Azimoolah Khan.
It wasn't without a reason. It appears you're in-
timately acquainted with this monster of infamy.</q></p>

<p>Her silkiness of tone had disappeared. Every
word seemed barbed with venom.</p>

<p><q>I don't understand what you mean, Mrs Ross,</q>
said Jean.</p>

<p><q>Really. It's fortunate for you that we're divided
into so many distinct communities, and that gossip
can't spread from one to another. In this garrison—
<pb n="243"/>
Dr Fayrer's—rumour has been pretty busy with you.
I can imagine nothing more horrible than having
one's name linked with that of Azimoolah Khan—
Azimoolah, the man who ordered the butchery of
the women and children at Cawnpore.</q></p>

<p><q>My name linked with Azimoolah! How can you
assert anything so terrible?</q> cried Jean, trembling
with indignation.</p>

<p><q>It's common talk here,</q> said Mrs Ross, her
merciless eyes never moving from the girl's convulsed
face. <q>There's not such a wide gulf between English
and Anglo-Indian society as you imagine. The
latest arrival from London usually brings some
interesting information, which shows how very small
the world is. It's no secret how you met Azimoolah
—he called himself a prince then—at a ball given
by one of the leaders of London fashionable
society; how you danced several times with him;
how he hurried to Cairo on purpose to travel with
you on board the steamer which brought you to
Calcutta.</q></p>

<p><q>That's an infamous falsehood. If he did, as you
say, come to Cairo for that purpose, he failed. I
have never seen him since I left London.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm glad to hear you say so, though I fear you'll
find it difficult to convince other people,</q> said Mrs
Ross, in a pitying tone. <q>Still, you may be sure
I shall do all I can to defend you.</q></p>

<p>Stung to her very soul, Jean drew back a step.
The girl, who but an hour since had defied death
itself, quivered under the poisoned shafts of this
woman, whose manner, whose look, whose voice
said as plainly as possible, <q>I hate you, and I want
to see you suffer.</q></p>

<pb n="244"/>
<p><q>Thank you,</q> Jean forced herself to say. <q>I will
not put you to the trouble. All I ask is, give me
the names of any persons you have heard speak of
me in connection with this man—a man whose
fawning manner and fulsome flattery were repulsive
even when I did not suspect anything wrong.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm anxious to believe all you say,</q> retorted Mrs
Ross. <q>But it certainly strikes me as exceedingly
curious, when everybody was talking of this atrocious
villain, that you should have been perfectly silent as
to your acquaintance with him.</q></p>

<p><q>Can't you imagine,</q> cried Jean vehemently, <q>the
horror I felt at the possibility of the man whom
I met in London being this Azimoolah Khan, at
whose name everyone shudders? Wouldn't you
have shrunk from acknowledging that you'd once
had any acquaintance with so cold-blooded a
fiend?</q></p>

<p><q>I prefer not putting myself in your place, Miss
Atherton,</q> said Mrs Ross, with icy politeness. <q>It's
a little too awkward for my taste. By the way,</q>
she added, as if the thought had just occurred to
her, <q>you were engaged to someone in London,
were you not?</q></p>

<p><q>I refuse to answer any of your questions, Mrs
Ross,</q> exclaimed Jean, with tears in her eyes.
<q>They're meant to be insulting.</q></p>

<p><q>You foolish girl. Can't you see that I want to
be your friend?</q></p>

<p><q>No. You're my enemy. Why I know not.</q></p>

<p><q>Nor do I, so dismiss that ridiculous notion.
You'd better answer. It would be to your interest
to do so.</q></p>

<p>There was no reply. The idea of laying bare the
<pb n="245"/>
secrets of her heart to this woman, who had for her
own purposes tortured her, was horribly repugnant.
Jean turned, with the intention of leaving, when Mrs
Ross seized her wrist.</p>

<p><q>Stay,</q> and Mrs Ross's voice took a sinister tone.
<q>I'll answer the question myself. Yes; you were
engaged, and the man you promised to marry was
Azimoolah Khan.</q></p>

<p>Had the matter not been of tragic importance
Jean must have laughed. There was really some-
thing inconceivably absurd in the idea. But it did
not seem absurd then—Mrs Ross was too terribly
in earnest.</p>

<p><q>Oh, you're mad—mad to imagine such a thing,</q>
Jean exclaimed.</p>

<p><q>And that's the only reply you will give me?</q></p>

<p><q>The only reply.</q></p>

<p>Jean's rejoinder was to walk out of the room.
She was wrought upon and felt sick at heart. She
wanted to be alone and think.</p>

<p>Directly Jean was gone, the face of the woman
left behind lighted up with an exultant smile of
malignancy.</p>

<p><q>A good day's work,</q> she laughed. <q>I've punished
Jack Hawke for his stupidity in falling in love with
this girl, and I've given the girl herself a bad quarter
of an hour. How everything has played into my
hands! If these letters are made public they'll only
confirm what I told her, excepting as to her engage-
ment with Azimoolah Khan. That was a beautiful
creation of my own. I daresay she spoke the truth
concerning him; but what does that matter?</q></p>

<p>Trembling with suppressed emotion—it had cost
her a tremendous effort to maintain her calmness
<pb n="246"/>
in Mrs Ross's presence—Jean descended the dark
staircase. The day had been excessively hot. The
air was stifling and oppressive. The firing on both
sides had ceased for a time, and the silence after the
din and crash of musketry and artillery was strange
and unnatural.</p>

<p>Gasping for breath, Jean slowly went down stair
by stair, guided only by the glimmerings of light
which came through the chinks in the shutters.
She felt she could no longer remain in Dr Fayrer's
house. For some hours not a shot had been fired
by the enemy, and there was now an opportunity
to get back to the Begum Kothee.</p>

<p>Telling one of the ladies where she was going, Jean
slipped out and reached the Begum Kothee in safety.
It was a relief to be away from Edith Ross. Her face
burned when she thought of the vile insinuations flung
at her. Mrs Ross's evident malice was as puzzling as
the source of her information about Azimoolah Khan.
In what way had she angered the woman? Jean
could not imagine.</p>

<p>Worse than the malice of Edith Ross was her
assertion that both Ernest Lennard and Captain
Hawke knew of Jean's acquaintance with Azimoolah.
There was absolutely nothing in that acquaintance,
but, as Mrs Ross had shown, it could be twisted by a
slanderous tongue into something very damaging.</p>

<p>The odd thing was that Jean was more concerned
about Captain Hawke's opinion of the matter than
she was about Ernest Lennard's. She liked Len-
nard extremely. True, she had said no when he
asked her to be his wife, but the fact that he <emph>had</emph> asked
her made her regard him with a certain tenderness.
But there was no passion. Lennard was not the man
<pb n="247"/>
to inspire passion. He had not the insistence, the
recklessness, the fighting qualities of Jack Hawke.</p>

<p>Lennard was the man of thought, Hawke the man
of action. If Lennard had brushed away her refusal,
she would have liked him better. He had been too
ready to accept her hesitation as a sign that he had
no chance. He had come to the conclusion too
readily that she had formed a prior attachment in
London. She had never said so—never even hinted,
at such a thing. Lennard had chosen to assume this
was the case, and to escape from her embarrassment
and to let him down gently, she had allowed the
impression to remain. She thought it better so.
It occurred to her that if he imagined she was free
he might repeat his offer, and she would have to go
through the pain of refusing him again.</p>

<p>But with Jack Hawke it was different. She was
conscious of a strange thrill when she thought of him
—of a flutter of the heart at the remembrance of the
feel of his strong arms when he bore her out of danger.</p>

<p>He had told her straight out he loved her and—
she had not said no. How eloquently he had pleaded.
His confession that he was a black sheep showed his
sincerity. He had told her she was his good angel.
It was sweet to hear him—she thought so at the time.
Afterwards she wondered if she had not been wrong,
in not checking his passionate words. Wrong or not,
she had listened, and she could not bring herself to
wish them unsaid.</p>

<p><q>He would die for me,</q> she murmured. <q>Ah, and
so, too, would Ernest Lennard. One is as brave as
the other,</q> she went on, remorse stealing over her at
the thought that she had done Lennard an injustice.</p>

<p>Jean buried her flushed face in her hands. She felt
<pb n="248"/>
that, should her last moment come, death would lose
its sting if she could die in Jack Hawke's arms.</p>

<p>Then followed swiftly the bitter reflection that he
must despise her if he believed she had encouraged
the attentions of Azimoolah Khan. Nay, the slander
went beyond mere <q>encouragement.</q> According to
Mrs Ross, the talk was that she was actually
<q>engaged</q> to this fomenter of rebellion, and that it
was on account of her <q>engagement</q> she had refused
Dr Lennard.</p>

<p>Slowly it dawned upon her she had made a
mistake in leaving Dr Fayrer's house. She ought
to have stayed and sought for an explanation from
both Lennard and Hawke. Lennard, she was sure,
would listen to her and would tell her more than
Mrs Ross had let out. The scandal must have some
origin, unless Edith Ross had invented it. But it
was not all invention. How had the malicious woman
found out about her knowing Azimoolah? Jean
wished she had not been so reticent about him. If
she had only told her father it would have been some-
thing. Her silence lent colour to Mrs Ross's malice.</p>

<p>She felt she could speak frankly to Lennard, but
about Hawke, whose good opinion she most prized,
she was not so sure. A strange timidity seized
her. It was not from a fear that Hawke would
not believe her version of the matter, but because
she had an intuition that to speak to him would
lead to a renewal of his love, and if this happened,
what would she say? Could she resist him?</p>

<p>These scruples deterred her from obeying her im-
pulse to <q>face the music.</q> That night the firing of
the rebels commenced with renewed vigour, and her
opportunity of returning to Dr Fayrer's was lost.</p>

<head type="main">Hawke's Secret Mission</head>

<p>For days the chief topic of conversation in all the
garrisons had been Havelock and the army of
relief.</p>

<p>After the arrival of Ungad, the native messenger,
on the 25th of July, with the letter from Colonel
Tytler stating that Havelock would be in Lucknow
in five or six days, the garrisons were in the highest
spirits. But when the six days went over, and
nothing was heard of Havelock, the old anxiety
returned.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Ungad, one dark night, left the
Residency with a plan showing the position occupied
by Colonel Inglis, and of the roads approaching it.
More than a fortnight went over and no Ungad
reappeared. Then it was that hope gradually began
to die out.</p>

<p>Many a time during this anxious fortnight the
men posted on the <q>lookout</q> of the Residency and
of the post-office—the two highest buildings—
glanced long and anxiously down the Cawnpore
road; but they saw no signs of the much-wished-for
relief force advancing.</p>

<p>At a very early date an organised system of look-
outs had been established. It was carried out in
this way:</p>

<p>At daybreak an officer, accompanied by a sepoy
<pb n="250"/>
was detailed to take post in the highest tower on the
roof of the Residency. From holes made in this
tower, the officer watched all the movements of the
foe. He had slips of paper with him, and one of
these he sent down by the sepoy whenever
necessary.</p>

<p>A precisely similar watch was maintained from
the roof of the post-office, and in this manner
Colonel Inglis was made acquainted with all that
was going on outside, so far as could be seen.</p>

<p>It was the proud boast of the gallant defenders
that throughout that long siege the British flag
never ceased to wave defiance to the enemy. No-
thing infuriated the rebels more, and the flag was
the constant aim of their sharpshooters.</p>

<p>Again and again were the halyards severed, the
flag riddled, the mast cut through by bullets. But
as soon as darkness permitted, a new mast, new
halyards, were supplied. Patched and darned as it
was, the flag continued to scorn its assailants.</p>

<p>Every day when the officer who had charge of the
distribution of the rations appeared at each garrison
he was eagerly questioned as to whether Ungad had
been seen; but the answer was invariably <q>No.</q>
But at last, on 6th of August, news came—not
through Ungad, but through Aodhan Singh, one of
the officers' orderlies, who had undertaken to act as
spy.</p>

<p>He brought no letter, but the dispiriting news by
word of mouth that Havelock's force had fought two
successful engagements on the Lucknow side of the
Ganges, but had been obliged to halt at Mungulwar
owing to cholera and other causes.</p>

<p>Naturally this intelligence was very disheartening
<pb n="251"/>
to the garrison, and the more despondent began to
take a very gloomy view of the situation. Havelock,
with his small army, they said, could never possibly
fight his way through the tremendous force of sepoys
who now held the city.</p>

<p>Others, however, contended that the check was no
more than was reasonably to be expected; still, the
most hopeful, with their spirits depressed by con-
stant watching and want of rest, had to admit that
the situation was very serious.</p>

<p>Four days later—the 10th of August—the second
assault of the enemy began. About ten o'clock that
morning a body, numbering perhaps sixteen hundred,
was seen to be massing in the trenches.</p>

<p>The meaning of the movement was understood,
and the word was passed that an assault was im-
pending. Instantly everyone was on the alert.</p>

<p>The signal was given half-an-hour later by a shell
bursting within the Begum Kothee. It came through
the roof into a room luckily unoccupied, but caused
great alarm; and Jean and the other ladies were
immediately ordered to remove into the ground floor.</p>

<p>The enemy began their attack in their usual
manner by springing a mine. The effect was
terrible. The greater portion of one of the houses
bordering the fortifications was blown in, the pali-
sades and defences for thirty feet along were
destroyed. A breach was made through which a
couple of regiments could have easily marched; but
the sepoys were not made of the stuff to charge in
the face of a withering fire.</p>

<p>Still, they came on with more resolution than they
had hitherto shown, and for a few seconds made an
effort to enter the breach. But the front and flank
<pb n="252"/>
fire from the garrison, chiefly composed of officers
many of them first-rate shots, paralysed the enemy
and they ran back, all but about thirty more daring
than the rest, who penetrated into the ditch of the
battery. A hand grenade dispersed them, and, so
far as this attack was concerned, it was over.</p>

<p>But the programme of the enemy was that a
general assault should be made, and at two or three
other posts mines were exploded, followed by a
mad rush of sepoys, who were repulsed just as their
comrades had been.</p>

<p>The attack was renewed several times, and the
various garrisons were occupied the whole day. The
losses of the enemy were enormous—far more than
on the occasion of the assault on the Redan.</p>

<p>Since the finding of Lady Constance Harwood's
letters to Azimoolah, on the body of the dead
Hindoo, Jack Hawke and Lennard had become
close friends once more. But by some mutual yet
unexpressed understanding the subject was never
mentioned. Both felt the matter was one to be
dealt with by the general in command.</p>

<p>There was little doubt the dead man was a spy,
but why he should be in possession of the letters
was a puzzle. His clothing was searched; all that
was found on him was some native money. Whether
he had confederates within the garrison it was
impossible to say. He had probably made his way
inside the fortifications by influencing one of the
native servants through the golden fish of Oudh.</p>

<p>The question was the disposal of the letters.
Colonel Inglis and Captain Fulton discussed the
matter. Fulton thought they ought to be given up
to Jean as the person concerned.</p>

<pb n="253"/>
<p><q>There's certainly no one else interested in the
matter,</q> said Captain Fulton. <q>Stay. I'm wrong.
There <emph>is</emph> someone else—Captain Hawke.</q></p>

<p><q>What has he to do with it?</q> asked Colonel
Inglis.</p>

<p><q>Just this. He's in love with Miss Atherton. It
came to him like a blow between the eyes when he
read those letters. It so happens that Azimoolah
Khan was his servant in the old days, and had, so
I understand, something to do with the scandal
that smashed up Jack Hawke, so far as Lucknow
society is concerned.</q></p>

<p><q>Is that so? Unlucky for the girl if she's fond
of Hawke. The letters are awkward to explain, and
if they fell into other people's hands might be
still more awkward. I shall give them to Miss
Atherton and suggest that she destroy them.</q></p>

<p><q>I agree with you and——</q></p>

<p>At that moment an orderly, after knocking,
entered the room and delivered a message to Colonel
Inglis. Captain Hawke wished to see the colonel.</p>

<p><q>The man we were talking of,</q> said Colonel
Inglis. <q>Shall we let him know the decision we've
arrived at about the letters?</q></p>

<p><q>Not unless he asks.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well. Tell Captain Hawke I'll see him.</q></p>

<p>The orderly saluted and retired. Hawke strode
in. He commenced abruptly.</p>

<p><q>I want your permission, sir, to leave the garrison.
I think I can make my way through the enemy's
lines in safety, and get some news of Havelock's
movements. Everywhere the disappointment's doing
far more harm than the Pandies' bullets.</q></p>

<p><q>That's so, Hawke, but your suggestion's absurd.
<pb n="254"/>
You'll never get through Lucknow alive, and we
shall lose a man we can ill spare,</q> said Inglis.</p>

<p><q>If I thought I should fail I wouldn't go, but I'm
certain to succeed. It's not the first time I've
masqueraded as a native, and, if you'll let me have
that golden fish talisman, I'll bet anything I'll pull
the thing off all right.</q></p>

<p>This put a different complexion on the matter.
It was well known that Jack Hawke spoke half-a-
dozen different dialects, that he'd studied the native
and his peculiarities like a book, and armed with
the talisman the venture, though full of risk, was
not hopeless.</p>

<p><q>You're a plucky chap, Jack Hawke. Here's the
precious talisman. Make your own arrangements.
Go, and good luck go with you.</q></p>

<p>Hawke took the golden fish, and without another
word departed.</p>

<p><q>I expected he would have said something about
the letters,</q> said Colonel Inglis, when Hawke was
gone.</p>

<p><q>Jack Hawke always does the unexpected,</q> said
Fulton, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>That night, Hawke, disguised in native costume,
his hair dyed, his bronzed face, hands, arms, feet
and legs darkened, stole from the southern fortifica-
tions into the city. He had purposely made himself
up to look like a ruffian, and he really could easily
be taken for one of the Lucknow <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">budmash</foreign>.</p>

<p>He threaded the narrow streets, which he knew by
heart, in safety, and reached the road to Cawnpore.
Here a native joined him, and, in spite of Hawke's
short answers, persisted in keeping him company.
As the fellow put two or three questions which
<pb n="255"/>
sounded suspicious, Hawke took a bold step. He
showed the man the talisman and told him frankly
he had come from the Residency, where he had been
employed as a servant.</p>

<p>The fellow's manner changed directly he saw the
talisman. Hawke represented that the defenders of
the Residency were nearly at an end of their re-
sources. Their only hope was in Havelock.</p>

<p><q>And their hope will soon be despair,</q> said the
man, who said his name was Hasun Khan, jeeringly.
<q>Havelock and his army have had to retreat. They
will never reach Lucknow. If they do, they will be
shot dead one by one in the streets. Every day we
are becoming stronger. Good tidings came yesterday.
The <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">talookdars</foreign> of Oudh are about to join us.</q></p>

<p>This was a grave piece of news. The <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">>talookdars</foreign>
were the most powerful class in Oudh. They were
mostly the hereditary representatives of Rajpoot
clans, and, without having a right of property in the
villages they controlled, yet had nearly all the privi-
leges of the property owners. The term <q xml:lang="hi">talookdar</q>
means holder of a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">talook</foreign> or collection of villages, and
the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">talookdars</foreign> were really tax-collectors, engaging
to pay the state a certain sum, and collecting a
higher amount from the villagers than they paid in;
the difference constituting their remuneration.</p>

<p>Hitherto the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">talookdars</foreign> had given no support to
the mutineers. A few of them were first seen in the
rebel army which Havelock, before his retreat to
Cawnpore, defeated at Bussorah Gunge, but the
majority took no active part, and it was thought
those men who did were a few isolated men who had
been coerced by the sepoys. But this was not so.
Ultimately the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">talookdars</foreign> went over to the enemy.</p>

<pb n="256"/>
<p>Hawke knew the importance of the information,
and he did not doubt that it was true.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> continued the spy, who was a Mohammedan,
<q>ere long you will see the green flag of the faith
floating over the Residency, and it will be done with
your help and mine, brother.</q></p>

<p>Hawke could hardly conceal his anxiety to hear
more. His self-possession was not equal to the task
of controlling his emotion perfectly; but the darkness
was his friend. Hasun Khan could not see the
change which came over his features.</p>

<p><q>Our assaults have failed twice,</q> said Hasun
Khan. <q>The third time we shall succeed. In three
weeks' time you will see. Do you know the Lutkun
Durwaza? It is a gateway opposite the Baillie Guard.
There we shall have two heavy guns. We shall
mine as near as we can to the Baillie Guard, and you
will then see the end of the Residency, and all within
it.</q></p>

<p><q>That is well,</q> said Hawke, keeping his voice
steady. <q>But, as you say, we've failed twice. How
do you know we shall not fail again?</q></p>

<p><q>What!</q> cried the Mohammedan, suddenly chang-
ing his tone. <q>Have you not received your instruc-
tions from Azimoolah?</q></p>

<p>Hawke could not repress a start. He had forgotten
that the dead spy from whom the golden fish had
been taken must have come from Azimoolah, and
that the latter had most likely given him the talis-
man. Hasun Khan of course believed that Hawke
was also one of Azimoolah's men.</p>

<p><q>Oh yes,</q> said Hawke in a confident tone; <q>I've
received my instructions. They're the same as yours,
brother.</q></p>

<pb n="257"/>
<p><q>I am glad. Azimoolah has not told me of you;
but I did not expect him to do so. We—you and I,
brother—are to guide a number of the braves through
the passage of Fyzabad. Once inside the Residency
walls there will be no chance for the sahibs and the
mem-sahibs.</q></p>

<p>Hawke started. This was indeed important infor-
mation. But what did the secret passage of Fyzabad
mean? He had never heard of it.</p>

<p><q>Ay, and more,</q> continued the Mohammedan;
<q>but that is my business and mine alone—mine, and
afterwards Azimoolah's. Aha!</q></p>

<p>The two were squatting by the roadside, resting.
Hasun Khan's knees were gathered to his dusky,
wrinkled face, upon which a ray of moonlight fell,
tinging it a ghastly green. What could Hasun Khan's
business be? Personal to himself or to Azimoolah?</p>

<p><q>Brother, it's enough that you are Azimoolah's
friend,</q> went on Hasun Khan. <q>Azimoolah's will is
your will. Maybe it is no secret to you that Azimoolah
loves a woman shut up in the Residency—a hand-
some baba logue—one he met across the black water,
in England.</q></p>

<p>The blood rushed to Hawke's brain. He quivered
in every nerve. But he dared not trust himself to say
a word. He wanted to hear more.</p>

<p>The grotesque figure squatting on the ground,
looking more like a hideous idol out of some temple
than a man, uttered a guttural chuckle.</p>

<p><q>You must help me in this, brother. You can find
out better than I can where this baba logue is. When
the braves have come safely through the passage it is
my task to conduct a chosen score or so to the house
where the girl is to be found.</q></p>

<pb n="258"/>
<p><q>And then?</q> demanded Hawke, in a low, hoarse
voice.</p>

<p><q>And then? Will she not be cared for? The
others will be put to the sword, but she—the chosen
one—will be guarded by Azimoolah as the apple of
his eye.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, yes!</q> interrupted Hawke, in a fever of im-
patience. <q>And her name?</q></p>

<p><q>Her name? Her name is Atherton—Jean
Atherton!</q></p>

<p>Hasun Khan pronounced <q>Jean Atherton</q> in his
own fashion, but there could be no doubt it was she
he meant.</p>

<p>Hawke felt inclined to strangle the man, and he
could easily have done so, but what was the use?
Azimoolah was the villain on whose throat he longed
to lay his hand. A very worrying question faced him.
Did this hideous design of Azimoolah Khan confirm
or contradict the assertions contained in Lady Con-
stance Harwood's letter? Reluctantly he came to
the conclusion that there was nothing in it at variance
with these assertions.</p>

<p>Hawke and his companion slept till daybreak.
When dawn broke Hawke had an opportunity of
studying Hasun Khan's face more minutely than
he had been able to do in the darkness, for it
was night when the fellow forced his company upon
him.</p>

<p><q>I've seen that scoundrel before, I'll swear,</q> he
muttered. <q>I believe he was once one of my own
servants.</q></p>

<p>It was difficult to settle the point by memory alone,
for in the days of his prosperity he had so many
servants he could not be expected to know each one
<pb n="259"/>
much less remember their names. He would have
to get at it by a roundabout method.</p>

<p>Cautiously he led the man to talk about himself and
what his past had been. By degrees, Hawke verified
his suspicions. Hasun Khan had been a <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign>
in his service. This was how he had become acquainted
with Azimoolah Khan, who was also one of Hawke's
servants.</p>

<p><q>This looks like Fate,</q> thought Hawke. <q>It drags
up the old business of Agnes and George Holcombe.
Hasun Khan and Azimoolah were as thick as thieves,
and when Azimoolah disappeared after the delivery
to Agnes of the anonymous letters attributed to me
Hasun disappeared too. By heaven, if this rascal
could be made to open his mouth he might throw
some light on the mystery. But I must wait. News
of Havelock first.</q></p>

<p>The danger of discovery was doubled now that
he had recognised Hasun Khan, but Hawke never
hesitated. He wanted to learn more of Azimoolah's
plans, and as Hasun Khan was evidently in Azi-
moolah's confidence Hawke made no attempt to
drop his acquaintance. Azimoolah, he learnt, was
busy massing a body of rebels at Bithoor to oppose
Havelock, and it might be that if he pushed on he
would even come face to face with the miscreant
himself.</p>

<p>It was the 16th of August when Hawke and
Hasun Khan set out at daybreak to plod along the
road towards Cawnpore, then some fifty miles
distant. On 29th July Havelock beat the rebels
badly at Onao and Busseerutgunge, but the two
battles had used up in killed and wounded one-sixth
of his European fighting men. Others were down
<pb n="260"/>
with sickness. In front were places to be stormed
stronger than those he had encountered. On his
left was a force watching for an opportunity to strike
him a blow, behind numbers of the enemy had
covered the Ganges and were consolidating them-
selves.</p>

<p>Lastly, as he himself wrote, <q>There were still
thirty-six miles between me and Lucknow. As the
enemy fell back they approached their resources; as
we advanced ours became less and less available.</q></p>

<p>Havelock did not hesitate where his judgment
convinced him he was right. Only a man of strong
will and strong convictions could have taken the
painful and disappointing step which the circum-
stances forced upon him. He saw clearly his two
victories availed him nothing, and the next day the
order to fall back to Mungulwar was given to the
troops, and received with amazement and muttered
grumblings.</p>

<p>Yet he was right. The sick and wounded were
sent back to Cawnpore, where Neill was command-
ing; and Havelock waited for reinforcements at
Mungulwar. Neill was furious at the news of the
retreat, and wrote Havelock a dictatorial, insubordi-
nate epistle, which the general characterised as <q>the
most extraordinary letter he had ever received.</q>
The answer was a merited rebuke. <q>A considera-
tion of the obstruction that would arise to the public
service alone prevents me from taking the stronger
step of placing you under arrest,</q> wrote Havelock
indignantly.</p>

<p>The effect of Neill's letter was unfortunate.
Havelock's sensitive spirit could not bear reproach,
and on the 4th of August he once more moved from
<pb n="261"/>
Mungulwar, though the obstacles to be encountered
were now more formidable than before. On the 5th
he again beat the enemy at Busseerutgunge; but
this time they carried off their guns, and fell back
upon Nawabgunge, a position as strong as that
which they had been forced to evacuate.</p>

<p>Once more Havelock had to hesitate. Between
his position and Lucknow the entire line was dotted
with difficult posts, each of them very strong. His
losses before reaching Lucknow would reach three
hundred men, leaving him with less than seven
hundred to force his way through entrenched and
barricaded streets, defended by a disciplined army.
He held a council of war with Tytler, his quarter-
master-general, Crommelier, his chief engineer, and
his own son, who served as adjutant-general.</p>

<p><q>The only three staff officers whom I ever consult
confidentially,</q> wrote Havelock to the commander-
in-chief, <q>but in whom I entirely confide, are unani-
mously of opinion that an advance on the walls of
Lucknow involves the loss of this force. In this I
concur.</q></p>

<p>With bitter feelings the force retired a second
time to Mungulwar, to wait for reinforcements and
recruit its strength. While there, Havelock received
an appeal for help from Neill, who was threatened
by four thousand men assembling at Bithoor. Re-
luctantly Havelock left his position, beat the rebels
a third time at Busseerutgunge, crossed the Ganges,
and on the 15th re-entered Cawnpore.</p>

<p>This was the retreat the news of which caused
such disappointment and consternation in Lucknow.</p>

<p>But though Cawnpore was reached, the fighting was
not over. The rebels had to be driven out of Bithoor.</p>

<pb n="262"/>
<p>Hasun Khan knew all about the defeats at Onao,
Busseerutgunge and Bithoor. These were nothing,
he considered, in comparison to Havelock's retreat
to Cawnpore.</p>

<p><q>He has now to reckon with Azimoolah,</q> chuckled
the man. <q>Azimoolah is in command at Bithoor.
We shall see victory, brother. Do you say that too?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I say that,</q> returned Hawke, adding to
himself, <q>Not victory to you dogs though, if I
know anything of Havelock.</q></p>

<p>They trudged on ten miles, till Hawke felt the fiery
sun almost unendurable. But he dared not show
signs of fatigue. Luckily, Hasun Khan proposed a
rest in the shade. They had scarcely thrown them-
selves down when a cloud of dust in the distance
sent them on their feet again. A horseman was
approaching, galloping at full speed.</p>

<p>As soon as he came near enough it was plain to
be seen he was the bearer of ill news. He was a
sepoy belonging to the 48th Native Infantry on the
way with the tidings to Lucknow.</p>

<p><q>We are beaten,</q> he yelled, as he went by.
<q>Havelock is on the march.</q></p>

<p>On he galloped, scattering dust from his horse's
hoofs.</p>

<p><q>We must return,</q> said Hasun Khan in alarm.
<q>If I'm captured the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">feringhees</foreign> will blow me from
the cannon's mouth, and you too, brother.</q></p>

<p><q>Thanks,</q> muttered Hawke.</p>

<p>He concealed his joy and willingly tramped back
to Lucknow. He thought of the brave patient hearts
in the garrison and what a ray of sunshine his news
would be. If all went well he ought to be back in
the Residency within twenty-four hours.</p>

<head type="main">Kismet!</head>


<p>When Hawke set out on his daring enterprise the
siege had entered upon its third stage. After their
last unsuccessful assault the rebels, utterly dis-
appointed at their failure, contented themselves with
mining, and it required all the skill and vigilance of
Captain Fulton and Major Anderson, the chiefs of
the engineering staff, to discover and defeat the
incessant efforts to blow up the various posts.</p>

<p>By this time, what with the cannonading and the
heavy rains, many of the buildings were in a terribly
tottering condition. The Residency was nearly
uninhabitable, and a large part of it had fallen in.</p>

<p>On 12th August the Cawnpore battery, which had
borne the brunt of the attack from the very first, and
had always suffered severely from its exposed posi-
tion, was silenced. This was due to the oversight of
the party who drove out the occupants of Johannes'
House and killed <q>Bob the Nailer,</q> in omitting to
blow up the building. The sepoys soon after
reoccupied the house, and it became a thorn in the
side of the garrison.</p>

<p>The 18th of August—the day on which Havelock
and Outram at Cawnpore were arranging their plans
for the advance—was a notable date. It was the
only day on which the rebels set foot within the
fortifications. This third assault was preceded in
<pb n="264"/>
the customary manner by the explosion of a mine,
worked by the enemy with sharp and noiseless tools,
not the slightest sound reaching the officers at the
post. The explosion made a breach of twenty feet
in the defences, and hurled two officers and three
sentries into the air.</p>

<p>One of the rebel officers dashed forward, and
waving his sword called upon his men to follow.
In a moment a bullet laid him low. His place was
instantly taken by another, who as quickly fell.
Aghast at the fate of their leaders, the storming
party melted away, and never again did they get
within the defences.</p>

<p>The following day the heaviest cannonade the
garrison had yet sustained opened upon the posts
to the north-east, and under its cover the mutineers
made an attempt to burn down the gates of the
Baillie Guard, but failed.</p>

<p>They were soon to discover that two could play
the game of mining. Captain Fulton had hitherto
been content with foiling the attempts of the enemy
to blow up the various posts; but he now determined
to take the offensive in mining. It was the only
instance during the siege.</p>

<p>The continual damage inflicted by the guns and
musketry firing from Johannes' House was no longer
to be borne. The silencing of the Cawnpore battery
had enraged the British officers and soldiers beyond
endurance. Johannes' House could not be taken by
a sortie. The enemy held it in overwhelming force.
There was only one resource, and that was to mine
under it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sepoys were exulting over their
success in silencing the Cawnpore battery. When
<pb n="265"/>
there was a lull in the firing the strains of <q>God
save the Queen,</q> and <q>Rule, Britannia,</q> played in
mockery by the rebel bands, came floating over the
fortifications from the city.</p>

<p>That exultation was destined to be short-lived.
For three days the miners, under the direction of
<choice><reg>McLeod</reg><orig>M‘Leod</orig></choice> and Innes, had been industriously con-
structing an underground passage fifty feet long
towards Johannes' House. The operation was kept
a profound secret, and only the skilled Cornish
miners of the 32nd were employed. All had orders
to work with as little noise as possible. From a
fifty-feet gallery two branches extended right and
left, and at the ends of these branches were chambers
where the charges of powder were to be laid. Thus
the house was being mined in two places. By the
20th of August the work was completed.</p>

<p>It was arranged that on the mine being exploded
two sorties should be made; and in the early dawn
of the 21st a fierce fire was opened on the doomed
house so as to mislead the enemy.</p>

<p>The mining had been carried on so noiselessly
that the rebels suspected nothing, and at the sound
of the musket shots they swarmed into Johannes'
House and the surrounding buildings.</p>

<p><q>We've got them like rats in a trap,</q> said
Fulton grimly. <q>Look at the beggars crowding in,
sergeant.</q></p>

<p><q>The more the merrier, sir,</q> returned the sergeant.</p>

<p>The two men were peeping through a couple of
loopholes. They could see the dusky forms of the
sepoys moving about, and in a very short time lights
began to appear at the windows.</p>

<p>For a minute or so the men remained silent. The
<pb n="266"/>
eastern sky was just tinged with gold, the sun itself
was not yet sufficiently high to be seen. Scores,
maybe hundreds, of the men who were rushing
hither and thither, like ants in a disturbed nest, had
gazed upon the sun for the last time.</p>

<p><q>What time, sir, is the mine to be fired?</q> asked
the sergeant, after a pause.</p>

<p><q>At four o'clock,</q> returned the captain.</p>

<p><q>And it's now five minutes to.</q></p>

<p>Five minutes! It seemed like five hours, so slowly
did the time pass.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a low rumble, the earth
trembled; then, simultaneously with a vast up-
heaval, there came a terrific report, and the four
walls of Johannes' house—a big building fifty feet
long—parted and fell outwards.</p>

<p>One huge cloud of smoke and dust obliterated
everything. Before it cleared away the two sortie
parties were across the intervening space, and were
attacking the adjoining buildings.</p>

<p>The rebels were wholly demoralised. Practically
there was no resistance. They fled for their lives.
The assailants had brought with them charges of
powder, and one by one the dwellings adjacent
were levelled to the ground.</p>

<p>A ringing cheer went up when it was seen that
henceforth the Cawnpore battery could not be
molested. The once commanding structure from
the roof of which a deadly fire could be poured on
the unprotected gunners was a mass of ruins.
Before sunset the guns in the battery were manned,
and were never again silenced.</p>

<p>Previous to the explosion there had come a
strange, an ominous silence. The firing on both
<pb n="267"/>
sides had ceased. Jean for two days had been
waiting her opportunity to cross to Dr Fayrer's
house. She had become impatient to see Hawke.
She burned to make it straight with him about
Azimoolah. Desperation had seized her. She did
not care if Hawke renewed his fierce love-making
or not.</p>

<p>She had no difficulty in slipping away unnoticed.
The Begum Kothee, situated in the very centre of
the position, was in no danger of being surprised.
Indeed, this house was not garrisoned by military
now, but left in charge of civilians. Jean had no
sentries to challenge her on her way to the open air.</p>

<p>She hurried along, keeping close to the various
houses. For the moment there seemed to be no
danger. Suddenly she heard the unmistakable rattle
of musketry towards the south. She trembled, and
for a few paces her footsteps faltered; for though
by habit the women got used to guns and musketry,
the firing never ceased to cause a chill at their
hearts when it ushered in another day.</p>

<p>Jean involuntarily turned in the direction of the
firing. She saw nothing for a few seconds; then a
column of fire shot into the air, succeeded by a dense
cloud of smoke. It was not the first time Jean had
seen a mine exploded; but hitherto all the mines
had been the work of the enemy, and she took it
for granted that this was one of the series.</p>

<p>A horrible feeling of terror seized her. What if
this explosion was succeeded by a successful onslaught
by the enemy? Only three days before, one daring
sepoy had set foot within the fortifications. He was
shot down, it is true. But what of that? Others
might succeed where he had failed.</p>

<pb n="268"/>
<p>She was midway between the Begum Kothee and
the hospital, and she knew not whether to go on or
return. The explosion had evidently taken the
inmates of the other posts by surprise. She could
see heads peeping above the parapet of the roof of the
nearest house.</p>

<p>Then came a pause in the firing—a silence. This
was when the sortie followed the blowing up of
Johannes' House. The silence was more alarming
even than the sound of musketry.</p>

<p>Her strength seemed to leave her, and she crept
within a doorway to rest for a minute or two and
recover herself.</p>

<p>She sat down upon the broad stone step, leaned
against the inner wall of the doorway, and closed her
eyes.</p>

<p><q>Miss Atherton! Good heavens! Is it you?</q></p>

<p>She looked up. Ernest Lennard was standing in
front of her, a look of mingled astonishment and pity
in his eyes.</p>

<p>The faint colour rose to her cheeks. It was
embarrassing for her to explain—and above all, to
Ernest Lennard.</p>

<p><q>Are you ill?</q> he inquired gently.</p>

<p><q>No, I am quite well. I——</q></p>

<p>She scarcely knew what to say. However, she rose
to her feet as if to justify her assertion that she was
not unwell, and stood a moment or two perfectly
silent. She longed to ask him what news he had
of Jack Hawke, but she dared not.</p>

<p>Just then a cheer burst from the roofs of the houses.
The men stationed there could see what was going
on now that the smoke had cleared away.</p>

<p><q>What does that mean?</q> she cried. <q>I heard the
<pb n="269"/>
sound of an explosion just now, and I was afraid
something serious had happened. I was frightened
and so I crept here.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not surprised at your fright,</q> said he. <q>Only
two or three were in the secret. I heard last night an
attempt was to be made to blow up Johannes' House,
and I gather from the cheering the attempt has been
successful. But—forgive my inquisitiveness—how is
it you're here? Of course you're going back to the
Begum Kothee? May I accompany you?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not going back there—at least, not just yet.
I'm going to Dr Fayrer's. I have special reasons for
seeking an interview with Captain Hawke.</q></p>

<p><q>It's a risky journey undertaken for nothing,</q> said
the doctor.</p>

<p><q>Do you mean I sha'n't see him?</q> she repeated
slowly, her voice sinking almost to a whisper. <q>Has
anything happened——</q></p>

<p>Her face suddenly became as white as a sheet, and
she pressed her hands convulsively over her heart.
Her attitude, her expression, the slightly parted,
tremulous lips, the grief-stricken eyes came as a
revelation to Lennard. No woman, unless her nature
was wrung by intense love suddenly bereft, could look
as Jean did at that moment.</p>

<p><q>Speak!</q> she cried wildly. <q>Why are you silent?
O God! I understand. He's dead, and you're
afraid to tell me. Dead! Dead!</q></p>

<p>She threw her hands above her head, clutched the
pillar of a verandah near which she was standing,
and her face slowly sank on her arm.</p>

<p>Her terrible grief shocked and distressed the
surgeon, though it assisted in his enlightenment.</p>

<p><q>You're mistaken,</q> said he gently. <q>Hawke isn't
<pb n="270"/>
dead. Forgive me for misleading you. He is not
in the garrison. He has gone on a dangerous mission
—disguised as a native—among the enemy—to learn
news of General Havelock.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah! how brave,</q> she cried, with sparkling eyes.
<q>And you've heard news of him?</q></p>

<p><q>No. It's hardly possible. We shall know
nothing until he returns. How long that will be no
one can say. He's now been gone five days.</q></p>

<p>Jean made no reply. Her eyes were cast down.
A strange calmness had come over her. Lennard
realised that her feelings for Captain Hawke were of
a much deeper nature than mere friendship, and he
added:</p>

<p><q>I've great faith in Captain Hawke's fertility of
resource and his knowledge of Indian customs and
ways, and I think he'll return safely. And now that
I've learned your feelings towards him, Miss Atherton,
I hope you will not have to wait long before you see
him.</q></p>

<p>Jean raised her eyes. They were moist and shining.</p>

<p><q>You're the most generous of men, Dr Lennard,</q>
said she softly, almost humbly. <q>I'm ashamed I
was so weak just now. I ought to have had more
courage—more control over myself. You forgive
me, don't you?</q></p>

<p><q>There's no forgiveness needed. It was as well
you said what you did. Life is here too short—too
uncertain for secrets. If you really love Jack
Hawke——</q></p>

<p>He stopped confusedly. Jean intuitively guessed
the cause of his hesitation. It was not extraordinary,
for the same thought was in the minds of both. She
came to his rescue.</p>

<pb n="271"/>
<p><q>You're thinking of that scandalous, malicious
gossip about Azimoolah Khan,</q> said she, quite
quietly.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> said he, in a tone of sudden relief. <q>The
story then has reached your ears. You've seen
Colonel Inglis, I suppose, and he has given you the
letters.</q></p>

<p><q>I've not seen Colonel Inglis, and I've seen no
letters. I don't know anything about letters. Mrs
Ross was my informant. She told me what she said
was common talk in Dr Fayrer's house. So kind of
her to let me know, wasn't it?</q> said the girl ironically,
<q>especially as there was any amount of falsehood and
misrepresentation.</q></p>

<p>Lennard stared at Jean in amazement.</p>

<p><q>Do you mean to say that Mrs Ross never ex-
plained that letters from a Lady Constance Harwood
to Azimoolah Khan, in which letters you were
mentioned, were found on the body of a native
believed to be one of Azimoolah's spies?</q> he cried.</p>

<p><q>Not a word. It's the first time I've heard of
these letters. Who found them?</q></p>

<p><q>Mrs Ross fetched me to see the man. He was
dead. She and I saw the letters together.</q></p>

<p><q>And you read them,</q> cried Jean hotly. She was
stung to the quick. The dissimulation, the treachery
of Mrs Ross were at the bottom of her resentment,
but she was angry with Lennard as well. Lennard
saw this plainly enough. He had done nothing to
justify Jean's anger, at the same time he felt as
though he were in a false position.</p>

<p><q>Yes, but you forget that the letters were ad-
dressed to Azimoolah Khan, the bitter, the crafty
traitor, the fiend of Cawnpore,</q> he rejoined quietly.</p>

<pb n="272"/>
<p><q>But why was I kept in the dark ? You at
least, Dr Lennard, might have told me about
these letters—especially after you had made your-
self acquainted with the contents,</q> cried Jean, her
indignation rising.</p>

<p><q>How was it possible? You left Dr Fayrer's
house. You were at the Begum Kothee. For the
last three days it was certain death to go from one
to the other.</q></p>

<p>Jean was silent for a brief space. The argument
was just, but her anger had not cooled.</p>

<p><q>Did anyone else have the pleasure of reading
Lady Constance Harwood's correspondence?</q> she
went on.</p>

<p><q>Captain Fulton was on the spot, and it was of
course his duty not only to read the letters but to
take them to Colonel Inglis, and he did so.</q></p>

<p>Not a word did Lennard say about Jack Hawke.
After Jean's unpremeditated confession of love for
Hawke, he would not breathe a syllable to wound
her. It occurred to him that if she knew Hawke
had read the letters it would add to her unhappiness.
The chances were she would never see Hawke again.
The latter had undertaken a hazardous mission.
It was hardly possible he would return. If he fell,
it was better that Jean should think he had died in
ignorance of the scandal.</p>

<p><q>Let us go to Colonel Inglis. Until I see for
myself what Lady Constance wrote, I sha'n't be able
to rest.</q></p>

<p><q>You can't go now,</q> cried Lennard. <q>It would
be madness. Wait at least till this evening after
sunset.</q></p>

<p><q>I won't wait a minute,</q> she returned doggedly.
<pb n="273"/>
<q>Dr Lennard, if you really feel that friendship
towards me you talked about just now, you'd help
me. But it doesn't matter. I've come from the
Begum Kothee by myself. I suppose I can find
Colonel Inglis by myself.</q></p>

<p>Lennard could see she was overwrought—that
opposition to her will was useless. He also could
guess the reason of her determination. It was to be
able to set herself right in the eyes of the man she
loved—Jack Hawke.</p>

<p><q>Very well,</q> said Lennard calmly. <q>Then let
us go.</q></p>

<p>He extended his hand, and she laid her soft fingers
in his. How the contact thrilled him! Yet, as his
hand grasped hers, he felt as though he were signing
his own death-warrant.</p>

<p>He gazed at her glowing face. Her eyes met his.
She started at the expression of mingled love and
despair she saw written there. She almost shuddered.
The look seemed to presage misfortune.</p>

<p><q>Dr Lennard,</q> said she suddenly. <q>We're friends
now, so you must obey me. Tell me where I shall
find Colonel Inglis. I'll go alone.</q></p>

<p><q>Colonel Inglis is at the Residency; but if you go
I shall accompany you.</q></p>

<p><q>I would rather you didn't.</q></p>

<p><q>Why?</q></p>

<p><q>I can't tell you. No, you mustn't.</q></p>

<p>She laid her hand on his arm and looked plead-
ingly in his face. He drew a deep breath, and was
conscious of a fluttering at his heart. She had never
appeared more beautiful, more lovable, than at that
moment. All the doubt and distrust which had so
tortured him for the past three days disappeared.
<pb n="274"/>
What did it matter that it was her love for Jack
Hawke that had so transformed her.</p>

<p>He raised her hand to his lips.</p>

<p><q>I've given you my word that I'll help you to
the last. I'm not the one to withdraw at the
first approach of danger. You misjudge me now
as I fear you've misjudged me for some time
past.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't say that. At any rate, if I've done so,
forget it,</q> said she softly.</p>

<p><q>I will—I do. Let us go.</q></p>

<p>She looked at him wistfully. It was strange that
within a brief quarter of an hour there should have
been such a revulsion of feeling. Never had she
been drawn so near to Ernest Lennard as now. Yet
it was not love. There was not an atom of the
senses in the feeling with which she regarded him at
that moment. It was pity—had she then been
capable of defining her feelings. Yet why should
she pity him, save for the reason that she was not
able to love him?</p>

<p>They started on the journey. In the distance
could be seen little flashes of light, a puff of blue
smoke following each flash. Occasionally came the
whistle of a bullet close to their ears.</p>

<p>They had walked about a dozen yards, when Jean
suddenly stopped.</p>

<p><q>I'd rather go by myself, Dr Lennard, believe
me,</q> said she.</p>

<p><q>I can see what you imply,</q> said he, in a pained
tone. <q>You doubt my courage.</q></p>

<p><q>No, no, no!</q> she cried vehemently. <q>Dear
friend,</q> she continued, her voice modulating into a
tenderness which found a responsive echo in
<pb n="275"/>
Lennard's breast, <q>stay here. Don't go any farther,
I entreat you.</q></p>

<p><q>And after speaking to me like that, you think I
shall obey?</q> said he reproachfully. <q>Don't let us
argue the matter. I'm not to be persuaded. Some-
times I'm as obstinate as—as you are.</q></p>

<p>She smiled, but it was a melancholy smile.</p>

<p><q>Very well,</q> she answered, <q>it shall be as you say.</q></p>

<p>They were at that moment crossing the space
between Dr Fayrer's house and the hospital. The
Residency was to the direct west of the hospital,
and the nearest way would have been in a diagonal
direction; but when the bullets were flying thick
and fast it was wise to seek any shelter, and their
intention was to take a right-angled path, thus
creeping along the southern wall of the hospital.</p>

<p>Between the western wall of the hospital and the
nearest point of the Residency was a distance of
something like two hundred yards, and this was
where the danger was. The guns of the enemy and
their muskets commanded this open space.</p>

<p>They reached the hospital wall in safety. They
crept along to the angle. Then they hesitated for a
moment, waiting for a lull in the firing.</p>

<p>At last it came.</p>

<p><q>Here's our chance,</q> whispered Lennard.</p>

<p>He held out his hand, and she accepted it. They
were about to start, when he stopped her.</p>

<p><q>How horribly impolite of me!</q> said he lightly.
<q>Do you see, I've given you my right hand instead
of my left.</q></p>

<p><q>What does it matter? But you're not impolite.
The right hand is the proper one, if there be any
choice.</q></p>

<pb n="276"/>
<p>However, he had already moved round, and they
set out hand in hand.</p>

<p>They crossed quite half the distance in safety.
Half-a-dozen random shots went by, and no more.
Then, apparently, they became visible to the sharp-
shooters, for the firing suddenly increased.</p>

<p><q>Let us make haste,</q> cried Jean.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that her companion was slacken-
ing his pace.</p>

<p><q>Yes, yes,</q> she heard him say, <q>let us make
haste.</q></p>

<p>His face was of a dusky pallor, his eyes were dull;
the pressure of his fingers upon hers suddenly
tightened, and as suddenly relaxed.</p>

<p>Before she could say a word his knees gave way;
he staggered a couple of yards, and fell.</p>

<p>There was no need for Jean to ask what had
happened. He was shot. Had they proceeded as
they originally started, she would have received the
bullet by which he had been struck!</p>

<p>Conscious of this, she knelt by his side and
frantically asked what she could do.</p>

<p><q>Nothing,</q> he gasped. <q>My time has come.</q></p>

<p><q>And you died for me!</q> she wailed.</p>

<p><q>Why not? I—I love you, Jean.</q></p>

<p>He could only whisper the words. He had been
shot through the lungs. The bullet had entered his
chest and lodged there.</p>

<p>She leaned over him and put her lips to his, which
already were icy cold.</p>

<p>A tender, loving smile lighted up his glassy eyes
for a moment and then died away. As a loud sob
burst from the girl, he breathed his last.</p>

<p>In an agony of grief, Jean gazed at him. She
<pb n="277"/>
could scarcely believe he was dead. It was not the
first time she had seen death come without warning;
but, let it come as often as it would, its terror, its
mystery, never altered.</p>

<p>What could she do? She was helpless, stunned.
Only five minutes before she had rejoiced in her
reconciliation with Ernest Lennard, and now—well,
after all, there was something in the creed of the
fatalist. Kismet—it was to be!</p>

<div n="20" type="chapter">
<pb n="278"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="20">XX</num></head>
<head type="main">In the Secret Passage</head>

<p>Under the scorching sun, Hawke and Hasun Khan
trudged along the dusty Cawnpore road, on their
way back to Lucknow. The only shade was that
furnished by a clump of trees about two miles from
where the sepoy met them. Hawke would have
lingered here till evening, but Hasun Khan was in
an agony of fear. His imagination conjured up
pursuit.</p>

<p><q>No, no, brother, there's safety nowhere but in
Lucknow,</q> he muttered through his chattering teeth.
<q>On—on!</q></p>

<p>Hawke saw it was no use protesting. Indeed, it
would have been imprudent. It might have raised
the man's suspicions. He could have separated
himself from the Mohammedan and gone on to
Havelock, but nothing was to be gained by this.
It was more important for him to hasten back to
the Residency with the news of Azimoolah's defeat
at Bithoor. Besides, he did not intend losing sight
of Hasun Khan until he knew more about the
secret passage from the city to the Residency,
which the fellow had said was known only to him
and Azimoolah.</p>

<p>On their second day's tramp, several stragglers
from the fight at Bithoor overtook them. They
confirmed the mounted sepoy's story, and brought
<pb n="279"/>
later news. Azimoolah had collected the remnant
of his forces and was hastening back to Lucknow by
a roundabout road.</p>

<p>More important was the tidings that Havelock
was unable to continue the pursuit. His men, ex-
hausted by an eight hours' march under a broiling
sun, followed by a fiercer battle than they had
hitherto fought, could do no more. Havelock had
no alternative but to retreat to Cawnpore.</p>

<p>This was bitter news to Hawke.</p>

<p><q>My God!</q> he muttered. <q>Havelock's delay may
seal the doom of the Residency.</q></p>

<p>Hawke would have been still more despondent
had he known the tidings which were awaiting the
heroic general on his return to Cawnpore. Opening
a copy of <title>The Calcutta Gazette</title>, Havelock saw that
he had been superseded in his command by his old
friend and commander in Persia, General Outram.</p>

<p>At that time the full extent of Havelock's marvel-
lous campaign was not known, or the command
would never have been taken from him. Extending
only from the 12th of July, when he started from
Allahabad, to the 16th of August, this campaign has
no parallel in the military history of British India.
On no former occasion had European troops been
required to march and fight in circumstances so
adverse, under a deadly sun or amidst torrents
of rain, often fasting for twenty-four hours, and
generally without tents, with no bed after their
victories but the saturated ground, and no shelter
but that which the trees afforded, carrying with
them their sick and their wounded, and all their
supplies, and suffering more from pestilence than
from the weapons of the enemy.</p>

<pb n="280"/>

<p>It was under all these disadvantages that, in this
brief period of five weeks, they had fought nine
actions against overwhelming odds, with troops
disciplined, and for the most part armed like them-
selves, and had been everywhere victorious without
a single check.</p>

<p>A large portion consisted of raw recruits, who had
never before heard the whistle of an enemy's bullet;
but such marching and such fighting had turned
the survivors into hardy veterans, ready for any
emergency.</p>

<p>So great was the confidence the men had acquired
in themselves, in their comrades, and in their leader,
that they never dreamed of a defeat, and never
marched to action without feeling certain of victory.</p>

<p>Such were the men, who, as <q>Havelock's Iron-
sides,</q> have earned immortality for themselves.</p>

<p>This is all now a matter of history. At the time
news came so slowly, and was so confusing when it
did come, only those with Havelock could fully
realise the stupendous difficulties he surmounted.
But men like Hawke, who had served under Have-
lock, knew and believed in him, and it was as well
Hawke was in ignorance of the injustice which had
been done.</p>

<p>Hasun Khan's delight that the English had been
checked was unbounded.</p>

<p><q>Aha,</q> he grinned. <q>The next fight will be
under the walls of Lucknow. What then—eh,
brother, what then?</q></p>

<p>Hawke shrugged his shoulders and forced a
laugh.</p>

<p>That night the two entered Lucknow. Azimoolah
had not arrived, but there were scores of men from
<pb n="281"/>
his command. They were coming in every hour
and from all directions eastward. Azimoolah was
expected the next day.</p>

<p><q>Allah be praised, we shall then see him,</q> cried
Hasun Khan. <q>You will return the golden fish
and tell him what you have done and what you
have learned in the Residency.</q></p>

<p>Hawke had made out to Hasun Khan that he had
been sent as a spy to the besieged garrison.</p>

<p><q>Oh, I'm expected to give up the talisman, am I,</q>
thought Hawke. <q>I know a trick worth two of
that. I'm not going to take the risk of an interview
with the scoundrel. One of two things will happen
—either he'll spot me or I shall lose my temper and
betray myself.</q></p>

<p><q>I shall not wait to see Azimoolah,</q> said Hawke.
<q>I must obey his orders. I was to return to the
Residency if I could not join him at Bithoor.</q></p>

<p><q>How did you know he was at Bithoor?</q> de-
manded Hasun Khan suspiciously. <q>Was it not I
who told you?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> returned Hawke, his eyes blazing. <q>You
had a long tongue. You did not know me, yet you
betrayed to me Azimoolah's secrets.</q></p>

<p><q>Betrayed!</q> faltered Hasun Khan. <q>How?
Did you not have the royal talisman—the golden
fish of Oudh?</q></p>

<p><q>And did you know how I came by the talisman?
Might I not have murdered Azimoolah's spy and
robbed him? I allowed you to talk and you told
me everything. What if I were to let Azimoolah
know of your faithlessness, your indiscretion?</q></p>

<p>Hasun Khan trembled from head to foot. Jack
Hawke's acting was splendid. It was his intention
<pb n="282"/>
to frighten the Mohammedan, and he succeeded.
He went on to reduce the man to a state of absolute
submission.</p>

<p><q>No harm has been done, but I shall report to
Azimoolah that you are not worthy of his confidence,</q>
he continued haughtily.</p>

<p><q>No—no—you say I have done no wrong,</q>
whimpered Hasun Khan, suddenly throwing himself
on the ground.</p>

<p><q>I said you had done no harm—fortunately. But
you are not to be trusted. You talk too much.
Azimoolah suspected this. He instructed me to
watch you. I have done it. Until we both meet
Azimoolah face to face, you will obey me—yes, by
virtue of <emph>this</emph> which no man of Oudh has ever refused
to honour.</q></p>

<p>He flashed the golden emblem before the eyes of
the grovelling wretch. The whole thing was a pure
piece of bluff. It answered its purpose. The effect
was heightened by Hawke's fingers toying with the
hilt of the native sword dangling from his waist-
band.</p>

<p><q>What does my lord desire?</q> mumbled the
Mohammedan.</p>

<p><q>I have told you my orders are to return to the
Residency. I escaped from the Cawnpore battery to
Johannes' House. I can't go back that way. Johannes'
House is now a heap of ruins. It's certain death
night or day to cross in front of the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">feringhee</foreign> rifles.
That secret passage of yours—the passage known
only to you and Azimoolah—take me to it.</q></p>

<p><q>I—I have sworn to Azimoolah never to betray
where it is,</q> stammered Hasun Khan.</p>

<p><q>Dog!</q> thundered Hawke. <q>Do you refuse?
<pb n="283"/>
Has not Azimoolah handed me his power by virtue
of this symbol? By Allah, you are not fit to live——</q></p>

<p>Hawke's sword flashed from its scabbard. It was
enough. Hasun bowed his head and poured out a
string of abject apologies. Hawke condescended to
be appeased.</p>

<p><q>It is enough. Come—the passage. At once!</q></p>

<p>The Mohammedan was effectually cowed. He
rose from his knees and without another word led the
way through the narrow, noisome lanes to the north
of the city, eventually emerging on the marshy ground
bordering the river Gumti. The sullen roar of cannon,
the fitful fire of musketry from besieged and besiegers,
followed them.</p>

<p>Skirting the Residency, Hasun Khan plodded
towards a little native village some two miles away
to the east.</p>

<p>The ground surrounding the village was very
broken and stony. Here and there were deep excava-
tions. These excavations—quarries, they might
almost be called—yielded the peculiar stone of which
the houses in Oudh are built.</p>

<p>Keeping a watchful eye on Hasun Khan, Hawke
followed him to a distant part of the excavations,
where the work had evidently ceased for many years.
Here was virtually a jungle. The two men pushed
through the dense vegetation and entered a species
of ravine.</p>

<p>The walls of this ravine became higher the farther
they went, and soon towered over their heads.
Suddenly the Mohammedan stopped and pointed to
a narrow opening in the rock.</p>

<p><q>That is the beginning of the passage. You must
be careful when you have gone about a quarter of a
<pb n="284"/>
mile. Here the passage splits into two. One way
leads to Fyzabad——</q></p>

<p><q>Are you telling me a lie?</q> broke in Hawke roughly.
<q>Fyzabad is fifty miles away. Fifty miles under-
ground! I can't believe it.</q></p>

<p><q>Why not? When our princes ruled, what was
time—money—labour? They said, let a thing be
done, and it was done.</q></p>

<p>Hasun Khan did not exaggerate. The passage
was constructed by one of the kings of Oudh, at the
time when Fyzabad was the capital and Lucknow
comparatively unknown. It was said that the secret
of its whereabouts was known only to the ruling
monarch.</p>

<p><q>Very well. I take it you're speaking the truth,</q>
went on Hawke, in the brusque tone he had used
before. <q>One way leads to Fyzabad. Go on.</q></p>

<p>Hasun Khan glanced uneasily at Hawke. The
latter no longer spoke after the manner of the native,
but the Mohammedan dared not say anything:
Hawke at that moment looked particularly aggressive.</p>

<p><q>It led to Fyzabad once. It no longer does so.
The roof fell in many years ago, and the passage is
blocked up. The other way will take you where you
want to go—beneath the Residency. Good luck be
with you. I shall report to Azimoolah where you
have gone. You will come back to him with your
news.</q></p>

<p>Hasun Khan made a gesture of farewell, and was
about to turn when Hawke's hand descended heavily
upon him.</p>

<p><q>So you'd like to sneak away, would you? You'll
do nothing of the kind.</q></p>

<p>The face of Hasun Khan went a sickly yellow.
<pb n="285"/>
Hawke had spoken in his natural voice, and—in
English! Again the Mohammedan went on his
knees, and in abject terror mumbled an appeal for
mercy.</p>

<p><q>You shall have as much mercy as you deserve.
We'll talk about that later on. Just now the most
important thing is a lamp. Jack Hawke doesn't
travel in the dark with such scum as you.</q></p>

<p><q>Sahib Hawke——</q> stammered the terrified man.</p>

<p><q>I guess you haven't forgotten me—nor my foot
either. Get up, and thank Allah I don't hurry your
movements with this.</q></p>

<p>Hawke tapped the hilt of his sword signifi-
cantly.</p>

<p>Hasun Khan stood tremblingly awaiting Hawke's
orders. They returned to the village, and the Moham-
medan borrowed a lamp and oil from an old man,
who had not the slightest suspicion Hawke was not a
native.</p>

<p>Once more Hawke and Hasun Khan were at the
opening in the ravine. The Mohammedan sub-
missively obeyed Hawke's orders. He had a whole-
some respect for the Englishman's muscles, the
strength of which he had experienced in the old
days.</p>

<p>Lighting the lamp, Hasun Khan squeezed his way
into the passage, Hawke, with his stalwart form,
having to go sideways for some two or three yards.
The passage then widened and soon became a cavern
of probably forty feet in length. At the extreme end
the roof gradually sloped downward, until they were
unable to stand upright, and finally were obliged to
crawl on their hands and knees. Once more they
were in a passage, much wider than that which formed
<pb n="286"/>
the entrance, but so low pitched that their crawling
became little more than a wriggle.</p>

<p>The heat was great, the air stifling, but Hawke
took no heed. He had done too much mining for his
surroundings to have any effect on him. Neverthe-
less he was glad enough when he was able once more
to stand upright.</p>

<p><q>Give me the lamp,</q> said Hawke. <q>Go on in
front. I'll let you have plenty of light.</q></p>

<p>For anything he knew, the Mohammedan might
lead him into a trap, and he was determined not to
be taken by surprise. He made Hasun Khan there-
fore walk quite a yard in front of him.</p>

<p>The ground was uneven. It was strewn with loose
pieces of stone, over which they now and again
stumbled. The air became more stifling the farther
they went. The lamp smelt vilely and added its
odour to that of the earth.</p>

<p>Soon mouth and throat became parched with
thirst. Their feet raised clouds of suffocating dust.
This was caused by the soft limestone called kunkur,
the only form in which lime is found in Oudh for
building purposes and road pavements. It is usually
met with in large lumps, in the centre of which is a
nucleus of flint.</p>

<p>They had been in the passage probably an hour,
when all at once Hasun Khan stopped.</p>

<p><q>Do you hear, sahib?</q> said he huskily.</p>

<p>Sounds of tapping, regular and mechanical, could
be distinctly heard. Hawke knew the noise.</p>

<p><q>Sapping, by Jove!</q> he muttered. <q>Our men or
the rebels?</q></p>

<p>His life depended on which way the question was
answered. Nevertheless he determined to push on.
<pb n="287"/>
Not so Hasun Khan. The man was in a cleft stick.
If the sappers were English, it meant his death. If
they were his own countrymen, his doom would be
equally sealed. It would not be believed that he
was not a traitor who had betrayed to his companion,
an Englishman, the existence of the secret passage.
He begged abjectly to be allowed to return. He
had kept faith with <q>his lordship</q>—would not his
lordship release him?</p>

<p><q>His lordship will do nothing of the kind,</q> said
Hawke coolly. <q>I and you, Hasun Khan, are going
on to the bitter end—whatever that end may be.</q></p>

<p>Hasun Khan wrung his hands and whimpered.
His entreaties, his terror, had no effect. Hawke
threatened to put a bullet through him if he refused
to go on. He had to obey.</p>

<p>The noises became more distinct. First came the
stroke, followed by the rattling of hard soil. It was
clear the miners were drawing very near.</p>

<p><q>Stop,</q> commanded Hawke.</p>

<p>They were opposite the place where the sappers
were working. Hawke's injunction came just in
time. A crash, blinding, choking dust, and a heap of
limestone blocked farther progress. To the right
was a big jagged gap.</p>

<p><q>By Jove, the devils have been before us!</q> cried
a voice, which Hawke had no difficulty in deciding
was Fulton's.</p>

<p>Fulton naturally took the passage to be the work
of rebel sappers. The light of the lamp Hawke was
carrying was luckily so feeble, and the air so thick
with dust, Fulton was ignorant anybody was in the
passage. Otherwise his revolver would have been
at work.</p>

<pb n="288"/>
<p><q>Hullo—hullo——!</q> yelled Hawke. <q>Bravo,
Fulton! Glad to find you busy.</q></p>

<p><q>Who the devil is that?</q> was Fulton's reply.</p>

<p><q>Jack Hawke.</q></p>

<p>The next moment the two had grasped hands.</p>

<p><q>My dear old Jack! What news?</q> cried Fulton.
<q>What about Havelock?</q></p>

<p><q>Havelock's doing just what you might expect—
pegging away. But——</q></p>

<p><q>What does that <q>but</q> mean?</q></p>

<p><q>After thrashing Azimoolah and the rascals under
him, at Bithoor, he's had to return to Cawnpore to
recoup. That's the story latest to hand. I don't
vouch for its truth, mind. It's likely, anyhow,
and——</q></p>

<p>Hawke jerked himself round. He had, in the
excitement of meeting Fulton, forgotten Hasun
Khan. The latter was nowhere to be seen. He
had taken advantage of the situation to escape.
Hawke did not intend that he should, and to the
astonishment of Fulton plunged into the darkness.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes he reappeared, dragging
with him the wretched Mohammedan.</p>

<p><q>Put this man in irons, Fulton,</q> he cried. <q>He's
Azimoolah's spy! Treat him well. He's likely to
be useful—to me as well as to the garrison. I must
see General Inglis at once. Will you come with me,
Fulton?</q></p>

<p>Within the next hour the three—General Inglis
Fulton and Hawke—were closeted together, and
Hawke went over his adventures. The two most
important points discussed were, firstly, Havelock's
victory at Bithoor and his compulsory delay, and the
contemplated attack on the Residency by Azimoolah
<pb n="289"/>
Khan, for which, according to Hasun Khan, prepara-
tions were being made.</p>

<p><q>By Jove!</q> exclaimed Fulton, <q>I can see now
the meaning of that battery the enemy have been
constructing opposite the Baillie Guard, at what they
call the Lutkun Durwaza Gate. They've mounted
two confoundedly heavy guns there, but I think,
when they open fire, we shall give them an effective
retort with our counter battery on the left of the
Baillie Guard. A present it's masked. Aitken's
sepoys hold it, and hold it well. The question is,
when will the beggars begin the attack? I suppose
Hasun Khan didn't tell you that?</q></p>

<p><q>No; and it's doubtful whether he knows. It
all depends how soon Azimoolah reaches Lucknow.
He won't lose any time, I'll bet,</q> returned Hawke.
<q>He must know that Havelock will be soon on the
march.</q></p>

<p>Captain Fulton determined to survey the city and
endeavour to ascertain from what point the attack
was likely to come.</p>

<p>He and Hawke ascended to the top of the tower
of the Residency. All they could settle was that a
number of men were tramping towards the city along
the eastern and southern roads.</p>

<p><q>Those must be some of the Bithoor rabble
coming in,</q> said Fulton. <q>Ungad says the Nana's
escaped and is now in Lucknow.</q></p>

<p><q>Then if the Nana's here, Azimoolah isn't far
off.</q></p>

<p>Ungad, whose services as a messenger were invalu-
able, arrived a few hours before Hawke, and had
brought a letter from Havelock in the usual receptacle,
a quill sealed at both ends.</p>

<pb n="290"/>
<p>It ran as follows:</p>

<p><q>I have your letter of the 16th instant. I can
only say, do not negotiate, but rather perish sword
in hand. Sir Colin Campbell, who came out at a
day's notice to command, upon the news arriving of
General Anson's death, promises me fresh troops,
and you will be my first care. The reinforcements
may reach me in from twenty to twenty-five days,
and I will prepare everything for a march on
Lucknow.</q></p>

<p>Nothing could be gained by remaining any longer
on the tower, and the two men descended. Both
were struck by the unusual quietude which prevailed.
It seemed to be a foreboding of disaster. It was a
curious fact that, so accustomed had the garrison
become to the constant, unceasing crack of the
enemy's musketry, that they felt uncomfortable if
they did not hear it.</p>

<p>A quiet day was generally the precursor of a mine
explosion or of an assault. And here, too, was
another noticeable fact. On the quiet days more
men were lost than on the fighting days. The ex-
planation was simple. During the fighting days the
men were careful to keep under cover, and to kill
without, if possible, exposing themselves to being
killed. But when there was no absolute fighting
a few well-aimed shots from the late king's African
retainers, and other first-rate sharpshooters, often
deprived the besieged of three, four, and even more
stout English hearts.</p>

<p>All that night the garrisons were on the alert.
Not a sound was heard, but early in the morning
<pb n="291"/>
large masses of men were seen moving about the
city.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock great alarm was caused by the loud
explosion of a mine in the direction of the bastion
of Gubbins' battery.</p>

<p>The report was so close and loud, and the air was
at the moment so darkened by smoke and by the
numerous weighty fragments of earth which were
falling and crashing everywhere about and over
the house, that all believed the bastion had been
blown up.</p>

<p>A mine had, indeed, been exploded close to it, but
an error in calculating the distance was sufficiently
great to prevent injury. The sepoys were industrious
miners, but the blunders they made in the direction
of the mines were incredible.</p>

<p>The mine had been a large one, as was evidenced
by the size of the gap in the earth, and the shock it
gave to all the houses throughout the position.</p>

<p>The enemy soon came out in force against
Gubbins' battery, and, fixing a huge ladder, with
double rows of rungs so as to allow of two or more
men mounting abreast, at the mouth of the 18-pounder
embrasure, attempted to escalade. But it was an
attempt only. They did not show their faces, but
thrust the muzzles of their muskets into the embrasure
and fired.</p>

<p>They were speedily dislodged by Major Apthorpe
and the men of the 32nd with hand grenades and
musket shots, while the sharpshooters kept up a
heavy fire upon them.</p>

<p>The loss of the enemy was very great, while that
of the defenders was exceedingly trifling.</p>

<p>While the attack on Gubbins' was going on,
<pb n="292"/>
another mine was sprung at the middle of the
brigade mess, and no doubt the one at the Financial
Commissioner's post would have been exploded as
well but for Fulton's vigilance. He was at work all
night and destroyed it.</p>

<p>But the enemy were not discouraged; and, putting
up with the failure of their mines, they opened out
with their newly constructed battery at the Lutkun
Durwaza. Crash came shot after shot at the Baillie
Guard Gate. Very little damage was done. The
stonework of the gate itself was massive, and the
gateway had been filled up with an enormous mound
of earth, in which the roundshot buried itself
harmlessly.</p>

<p><q>All right, my lads,</q> said Aitken, who was in
charge of the masked battery, <q>we'll return the
compliment now we know where you are.</q></p>

<p>He gave the order. The 18-pounder and the
24-pounder howitzer, of which the battery consisted,
suddenly belched forth fire and death, to the con-
sternation of the enemy's gunners.</p>

<p>Azimoolah's efforts at the Lutkun Durwaza had
failed, and the rebel troops, which had been massed
waiting for the opening, were drawn up uselessly.
From that day the rebels never attempted an assault
nor a close attack on any single post.</p>

<p>The result was that, while the enemy's efforts had
become feeble, the defence was practically assured.</p>

<head type="main">Captain Fulton, the Real Defender of
Lucknow</head>


<p>Not until it was quite certain the Baillie Guard was
safe did Hawke trouble about anything else but
fighting. What his ex-<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">khitmutgar</foreign> Hasun Khan
could tell about the old scandal which drove Hawke
out of Lucknow society could wait—Edith Ross
could wait—even Jean Atherton could wait.</p>

<p>But now that there was a chance of a few hours'
rest, Hawke's mind went back to his own affairs.</p>

<p>When he came off duty he looked a somewhat
dilapidated object, but he was no worse than any
of the rest. As time went on, both men and officers
became veritable scarecrows. Clothes had worn out,
and there was no means of procuring others.</p>

<p>Many of the officers were to be seen in shirts,
trousers, and slippers only. One gallant civilian
stripped the Residency billiard-table of its green
cloth, and contrived to make himself a sort of loose
coat out of it, while an officer wore a shirt made
out of a floorcloth.</p>

<p>Some time before the siege began, the use of
white outer clothing had been discontinued, and the
light coats and trousers of the officers and men had
been dyed of a light brown dust colour, which came
into general use throughout the siege.</p>

<p>The privates learned to make the dye by mixing
<pb n="294"/>
together the black and red inks with which the
various officers were well supplied. So many raids
were made upon the inks that very little remained
for legitimate purposes when the end of the siege
came. The superintendent of Mr Gubbins' depart-
ment thought he had preserved his stock by locking
it up in a cabinet; and having occasion to want
some ink he discovered that the panels of the
cabinet had been removed and then carefully re-
placed. All his cherished stock of ink had dis-
appeared.</p>

<p>But though the ordinary necessities of life were
scarce, money was plentiful, as was shown by the
prices paid for what had come to be looked upon as
luxuries.</p>

<p>On the 27th of August small cakes of chocolate
realised from three to four pounds; a ham seven
pounds ten shillings; a bottle of honey, four pounds
ten shillings, a bag of coarse flour one shilling; a
bottle of brandy one pound fourteen shillings, and
a small chicken two pounds. Sugar, had there been
any for sale, would have commanded almost any
price. A new flannel shirt fetched four pounds,
whilst five old ones realised eleven pounds four
shillings.</p>

<p>Hawke was on his way to the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>, where
Hasun Khan was imprisoned in an improvised cell.
On one of the staircases he met a young officer who
had been wounded in the assault on the Baillie Guard.</p>

<p><q>Who's looking after you—Lennard?</q> said
Hawke, glancing at the other's bandaged arm.</p>

<p><q>Lennard! Haven't you heard? The poor
fellow's gone the way of scores of our best and
staunchest comrades.</q></p>

<pb n="295"/>
<p><q>My God! not dead surely?</q></p>

<p><q>Shot a week ago. He was coming here from the
Begum Kothee with Miss Atherton when the bullet
struck him. She was the only one with him when
he died. Hard lines for the poor girl if she was
attached to him. It's said he was sweet on her.</q></p>

<p>Hawke made no reply. He turned away fiercely.
The death of his old friend was a terrible shock, but
he crushed his grief. What was the use of grieving
when his own turn might come next?</p>

<p>He went on to the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>, found the cell, and
entered. There was sufficient light for the two men
to see each other, and Hasun Khan shrank back.
Hawke looked at him sternly for several seconds
without speaking.</p>

<p><q>Well, you scoundrel?</q> at last he exclaimed
wrathfully.</p>

<p>Hasun Khan dropped his head. He could not
place his hands on his breast, in the deprecatory
manner of the Oriental, simply because his arms
were secured.</p>

<p><q>Hasun Khan is your lordship's servant,</q> he
mumbled.</p>

<p><q>Is he?</q> said Hawke ironically. <q>I remember
he was once, till he took himself off with a still
greater blackguard, Azimoolah Khan.</q></p>

<p>The amount of humility Hasun Khan contrived
to throw into the bend of that supple neck of his
was wonderful. Hawke stood and silently watched
him.</p>

<p><q>Yes, you scoundrel,</q> he continued slowly, <q>you
are certain to be shot unless——</q></p>

<p>He paused, and Hasun Khan's convulsed face
was upturned eagerly to his.</p>

<pb n="296"/>
<p><q>Ah,</q> screamed Hasun, <q>the sahib is good and
kind. He can save poor Hasun's life if he chooses
to do so.</q></p>

<p><q>If he chooses,</q> repeated Hawke. <q>You're not
far from the mark, my crafty friend—if he chooses.
Supposing the sahib did choose, what would you do
in return?</q></p>

<p><q>Anything—everything. My lord might com-
mand his poor slave Hasun for the rest of his
life.</q></p>

<p><q>Not good enough. His lordship doesn't want
the bother. Look here, Hasun, I'm going to speak
plain. I can, by simply holding up my finger, save
you from being shot. It can be done, if you'll do
as I tell you.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, yes! Tell me, sahib—tell me,</q> replied the
man, in trembling accents.</p>

<p><q>I'm going to take your memory back to the time
when you and Azimoolah were in my service. First,
then, answer me this question. Who gave that
letter to Azimoolah to take to Mrs Holcombe the
day he and you disappeared?</q></p>

<p>Mrs Holcombe, it will be remembered, was Mrs
Ross's sister Agnes, to whom Hawke was once
engaged. The engagement was broken off, chiefly,
as Hawke always believed, through the machinations
of her sister Edith Ross, then Edith D'Arcy. After
Holcombe's marriage with Agnes, her husband received
the anonymous letter, written apparently in Hawke's
hand, and certainly delivered by his servant Azi-
moolah Khan. This letter reflected on Mrs Hol-
combe, and the malicious did not hesitate to whisper
that it had been sent by Hawke out of revenge for
being jilted.</p>

<pb n="297"/>
<p>Hasun Khan's eyes glistened maliciously at the
question.</p>

<p><q>A mem-sahib paid Azimoolah to deliver the letter.
She gave it to him. We both promised to go away
so that we should not be found, and we kept our word.</q></p>

<p><q>A mem-sahib!</q> shouted Hawke. <q>What mem-
sahib?</q></p>

<p><q>The tall, dark mem-sahib D'Arcy.</q></p>

<p>Hawke started as though he had been stung.</p>

<p>The <q>tall, dark mem-sahib D'Arcy</q> could be no
other than Edith. He knew Edith to be unscrupu-
lous, but he never suspected her capable of such black
treachery. He had always put down the letter to
some man who was jealous of him. There were
several in the regiment. If Hasun Khan spoke the
truth, Edith Ross had ruined him in the eyes of the
world.</p>

<p>For a moment the discovery overwhelmed him.
Had the woman been near he would have struck her
down mercilessly, and rejoiced in so doing. That
she would ever confess it was her hand which had
blighted his career he did not believe. She would
simply swear that Hasun Khan lied.</p>

<p>He knew well enough that Edith had been madly
in love with him; that it was jealousy of her sister
Agnes which led her to plot till his engagement with
Agnes was broken off. Jealousy to this point was
conceivable, but to carry it to the pitch of injuring
him irreparably seemed unnatural. It was not the
act of a woman, but of a devil.</p>

<p>Hawke was mad with impatience to have the
thing thrashed out. He would go at once in search
of Edith Ross and face her with Hasun Khan. He
turned to the Mohammedan.</p>

<pb n="298"/>
<p><q>Do you swear what you say about mem-sahib
D'Arcy is true? Remember, your life depends
upon it.</q></p>

<p><q>I swear before Allah every word is true!</q> said
Hasun Khan humbly.</p>

<p>Hawke went off to find Mrs Ross, but before he
could do so he was met by an officer who told him
more serious work was expected at Gubbins'
battery.</p>

<p><q>You can be of use there with Lieutenant Alex-
ander,</q> said the officer, and hastened away.</p>

<p>Hawke's personal business must again be put off,
and he dismissed Edith Ross from his mind in the
face of what was of much more importance.</p>

<p>The state of things at Gubbins' battery was just
then very peculiar. The enemy's guns commanded
it, but owing to the lack of shot the rebels made
very little headway. Latterly, however, they had
begun to use a very odd kind of missile. For some
time past they had been employing logs of wood
shod with iron, and a still more injurious projectile
was that which they now devised. It consisted of
hollow cylinders of thin iron filled with an inflam-
mable composition, and wrapped up in strong
canvas. On reaching the ground the apparatus
burst, and the fine cylinders spouted forth fire with-
out any further explosion. This, perhaps, was the
most curious and complicated projectile that had
yet been devised.</p>

<p>The south-west battery of Gubbins' garrison was
opposed to four guns of the enemy, and Major
Apthorpe, who commanded the post, had repeatedly
urged that those guns should be silenced. But the
apprehension of supplying the enemy with round-
<pb n="299"/>
shot prevailed, and the only reply to the enemy was
a weak and desultory fire. An artillery officer used
to visit the post for two hours every day, and then,
after firing one shot every twenty minutes, left it
again.</p>

<p>This, of course, produced no effect on the enemy's
battery, while the over-economy of shot had a
disastrous consequence to the besieged.</p>

<p>The enemy's battery consisted of an upper and a
lower one, and as the heavy shot of the former did
a great deal of damage, Major Apthorpe at last
obtained permission to try the effect of a continuous
cannonade, which Lieutenant Alexander was deputed
to carry into effect.</p>

<p>He was an excellent artillerist, and with twenty
shots he knocked to pieces the enemy's embrasure,
and damaged the carriage of a 24-pounder, so that
it could be seen, muzzle in the air, abandoned by the
enemy.</p>

<p>On that afternoon Captain Fulton dined at the
post, and he was delighted with Alexander's success.</p>

<p><q>If we could only smash up the lower battery as
well!</q> said Mr Gubbins. <q>Not a stick of it has yet
been knocked down, and the beggars have got the
distance—240 yards—so accurately their fire comes
into our embrasures with the greatest precision.</q></p>

<p><q>Well,</q> said Fulton gaily, <q>we must put Alex-
ander on to this battery as well. I'll go down and
see what he has done and what he has yet to do.</q></p>

<p>Fulton rose, and so did half-a-dozen others, and
they went down to examine the effect of Alexander's
cannonade.</p>

<p>Presently Major Apthorpe returned to those who
remained sitting at the table, and, with horror in
<pb n="300"/>
his countenance, told them that Fulton had been
killed.</p>

<p>It appeared that while examining the battered
embrasure of the enemy with his glass Captain
Fulton had discovered some of the enemy at work
there, and had called to Alexander to come with him
and resume his fire.</p>

<p>Fulton himself proceeded on to the bastion, and
entered it before the rest. He approached the
embrasure, and at the moment when he reached it
one of the guns of the lower battery unhappily
opened fire, and the ball, entering the embrasure,
struck Captain Fulton, carrying off the top of his
head. Death must have been instantaneous.</p>

<p>Thus fell George Fulton, whose untiring exertions
had mainly contributed to success during the dark
days of the defence, of which he was not permitted
to see the brighter ending. He was the life and soul
of all that was persevering, chivalrous and daring.
He was ever full of hope, and the flagging in spirit
and the despondent always renewed their courage
after a word or two from cheery Captain Fulton.
Not without good reason has he been called the real
defender of Lucknow.</p>

<p>Hawke heard the news on his way to the battery.
Tears were in the eyes of the man who told him, and
Hawke felt a choking in his throat too.</p>

<p><q>Why doesn't a bullet take me?</q> he muttered.
<q>I'm not worth much. But Fulton—it's too cruel!</q></p>

<p>After such a disaster as this, what was the value
of anything? All was small, paltry. He rushed to
the battery, and no one in the whole garrison fought
harder and exposed himself more recklessly than
did Jack Hawke during the next two days and
<pb n="301"/>
nights. He never sought an interval of rest. But
nature had its revenge. He dropped asleep at his
post, worn out by sheer fatigue. A couple of soldiers
laid him on some rush mats, and for a time he was
dead to the world.</p>

<p>It was like the coming back of life when Hawke
awoke. At first he could hardly realise where he
was and what had happened. Then gradually his
brain resumed its functions, and events arranged
themselves in their proper sequence. His secret
journey disguised as a native, the meeting with
Hasun Khan, the latter's revelations concerning the
designs of Azimoolah, the return through the under-
ground passage, the story of Edith Ross's malignant
treachery he had extracted from the lips of the
prisoner, the death of Fulton—all was clear.</p>

<p>Fulton's death had interfered with his desire to
find Mrs Ross and confront her with Hasun Khan.
There was nothing now in the way to prevent Hawke
from gratifying that desire. For the moment his
services were not wanted. One of the periods of
stillness which were ever the puzzle of the besieged
had come about. The rebels had ceased to fire a
shot. Why was best known to themselves. At first
these mysterious silences were alarming, and indeed
were preludes to fierce cannonade and volleys of
musketry, but towards the end of the siege they led
to nothing, and the garrison became used to them.</p>

<p>Hawke languidly asked the news of the man who
was at the loophole, rifle in readiness should any
sepoy unguardedly show his head. Things were just
the same, he was told.</p>

<p><q>How long have I been asleep?</q></p>

<p><q>A good ten hours, sir. Major Trafford's been here
<pb n="302"/>
and saw you lying there just as if you were dead.
He said you were to be let alone, but when you awoke
you were to see the general. It was about that fellow
who came with you. I guess he'll be hanged for
a spy, won't he? P'raps the hanging's come off
already.</q></p>

<p>Hawke was on his feet in a moment. If Hasun
was dead, good-bye to his chance of righting himself
in the eyes of his comrades.</p>

<p>But if not—if he could confront Mrs Ross with the
spy and force her to confess her treachery! This
would be a victory indeed. He could then go with a
clear conscience and clean hands to Jean Atherton.</p>

<p>Hawke was admitted to the Residency. He ascer-
tained at once that Hasun Khan was still in the flesh.
He also found that Mrs Ross was lodging in the
Residency.</p>

<p>Hawke hastened up the staircase leading to the
rooms where the few ladies in the Residency were
lodging. Their quarters were in the centre of the
building, safe from shot and shell.</p>

<p>He was passing along a corridor when a door to
the right opened suddenly and as quickly closed
again. Short as the interval was, it was long enough
for him to see that the person who opened the door
was the woman he had at that moment in his mind.</p>

<p>The next moment he was in the room. The only
occupant was Edith Ross. Maybe she suspected she
was seen, and that Hawke was anxious to speak with
her, for she was standing motionless in the centre of
the apartment, and made no attempt to move when
he entered. He was never on equal terms with Mrs
Ross, because he could not control his temper; while
she, however excited she might feel, always maintained
<pb n="303"/>
her coolness. It was so now. The sight of her calm,
mask-like face sent him into a fury.</p>

<p><q>You're true to your serpent-like nature!</q> he
burst out passionately. <q>Thank heaven, I'm begin-
ning to see you in your true colours!</q></p>

<p><q>And what are they?</q> she asked. <q>My dear
Jack, don't let us beat about the bush, get out of
temper, and call each other names.</q></p>

<p><q>You're right. If I called you by your true name
it might be unpleasant for you to hear.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank you for the implied insult, Jack. May I
say your manners don't improve,</q> said she, quite coolly.</p>

<p><q>I want you to come with me. I wish you to
listen to something a certain man has to say. It
has to do with you—it has to do with me.</q></p>

<p>He was as hot as she was cold.</p>

<p><q>You're referring to that lying scoundrel Hasun
Khan, I presume.</q></p>

<p>Hawke started. He was not aware that the
imprisonment of the spy, his name, the circum-
stances under which he was brought in by Hawke
himself, were matters of common gossip in the
Residency.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> cried Hawke. <q>How did you know I was
referring to him?</q></p>

<p><q>Because I've seen the rascal, and he told me a
good deal that was interesting,</q> said Mrs Ross
looking Hawke full in the face.</p>

<p><q>About yourself?</q></p>

<p>She laughed lightly. <q>Oh dear, no; about you.
My dear Jack, it's a case of crying quits. I know
what he told you concerning me——</q></p>

<p><q>And you confess it? I see you do,</q> he broke
in savagely. <q>You own yourself to be a liar, a
<pb n="304"/>
slanderer, a forger! You employed this man as
your Indian ancestors employed assassins to stab
those they hated. I don't know but what your
crime is worse than theirs. If you were a man I
should know what to do; but you're a woman, and
that's your protection.</q></p>

<p>She came close to him. An unearthly light shone
in her eyes.</p>

<p><q>Why don't you kill me, Jack?</q> said she, in a
voice vibrating with passion. <q>I deserve it. No
matter that I was mad when I injured you; no
matter that I've suffered years of torture and
remorse. Kill me! Kill me!</q></p>

<p>She twined her arms about his neck, her brilliant
eyes were fixed upon his, her lithe, supple form
seemed to have lost all muscular power. It clung
helplessly to his.</p>

<p>He stood rigid, unbending; but for her hands
clasped convulsively round his neck she would have
fallen. The flood of agonised passion which swept
over her did not make her less conscious that he
repelled her.</p>

<p><q>Why don't you speak?</q> she cried. <q>Ah, if you
knew how I'm torn! I know not if I hate or love
you more.</q></p>

<p><q>I care as little for your hate as for your love.
It's all one to me,</q> he retorted. <q>I've come upon
the truth, but I'll act fair. I'll give you a chance.
Come with me, and we'll have Hasun Khan's story
from his own lips in your presence.</q></p>

<p><q>With you—the one most interested—as the
judge! And you call that acting fair!</q></p>

<p><q>Come,</q> he reiterated, taking no further notice
of her words, <q>unless you're afraid.</q></p>

<pb n="305"/>
<p>The taunt went home. Mrs Ross drew herself
up scornfully.</p>

<p><q>That's a coward's argument. I'm ready to face
an army of liars and spies. Yes, I'll go with you.</q></p>

<p>No sentry was posted to guard Hasun Khan. A
man could not be spared. The Mohammedan was
loaded with irons and put under lock and key.
Escape was impossible.</p>

<p>Leaving Mrs Ross at the head of the staircase
leading to the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>, Hawke went in search of
the officer who had charge of the key of Hasun
Khan's cell. The officer was Colonel Champneys,
who had grown grey in the company's service, and
in fact had retired when the Mutiny broke out.
Some called him a doddering old man.</p>

<p><q>The key?</q> mumbled the veteran. <q>Here it is.
I hope I sha'n't be bothered with it much longer.
The rascal ought to have been hanged right away.
Means another mouth to feed. Too much fuss has
been made over the scoundrel. Edith D'Arcy—I
beg her pardon, Edith Ross—know her best as
Edith D'Arcy; General D'Arcy was an old comrade
of mine—pestered me early this morning to let her
see the fellow. His father was a trusted servant of
the general, she said. She got her own way—always
did, the baggage—and I let her have the key. She
wasn't a bit afraid—the D'Arcys never were afraid of
anything, and Edith's the pluckiest of the lot.</q></p>

<p>Hawke took the key and hastened back to Mrs
Ross.</p>

<p>They reached the dark corridor of the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign>,
and having unlocked the door Hawke drew back
to allow Mrs Ross to enter first. He noticed she
did so reluctantly.</p>

<pb n="306"/>
<p>Dark as was the corridor, darker still was the
little low-ceilinged room, the only window of which
was a long, slit-like aperture. Hasun Khan was
lying motionless on his mat in a corner.</p>

<p><q>Hasun!</q> called out Hawke.</p>

<p>There was no response. The man must have been
sleeping very heavily. He made no sign when
Hawke touched him with his foot.</p>

<p>Hawke bent over the prostrate man and felt his
hand and wrist. Both were icy cold. Then he
caught sight of a silk scarf tied round the neck.
Here was the explanation. Hasun Khan was dead
—strangled.</p>

<p>Hawke said not a word but undid the scarf. It
was not nearly so tightly tied as it appeared to be.
A finger could be easily inserted between it and
the throat.</p>

<p>Hawke went to the door. Mrs Ross shrank more
into the gloom.</p>

<p><q>I'm going to fetch a lamp,</q> said he, in passing
her.</p>

<p>Hawke was away about five minutes. When he
returned, Edith Ross was in the corridor. Taking
no notice of her, Hawke entered the cell and held
the lamp close to the dead man's throat. There
were no creases, as would have been the case had
he been strangled by the scarf. On either side the
windpipe was a slight discoloration, hardly notice-
able owing to the Mohammedan's dark skin. The
windpipe itself was a little swollen. Hawke knew
what these signs meant.</p>

<p>Hasun Khan had been strangled by someone well
acquainted with the methods practised by the Thugs.
Nothing could well be more speedy and effective.
<pb n="307"/>
All one had to do was to stand behind the victim,
grasping a silk handkerchief tightly with both hands
placed about two inches apart. The victim taken
unawares, the hands were swiftly put over the head,
dropped down in front of the neck, the centre of the
space between the hands over the windpipe. Then
the hands were pressed back with a jerk so that the
bent joints of the thumbs were forced against the wind-
pipe on either side. In a few seconds all was over.</p>

<p>Hawke raised his eyes towards Mrs Ross, who was
still in the corridor. Her face was livid, her attitude
suggested terror.</p>

<p>He said not a word, but tied the scarf round the
dead Hasun Khan's throat more tightly than before.
Then he rose to his feet. The terrible conviction
forced itself upon his mind that the author of Hasun
Khan's death stood before him!</p>

<p>He passed out. The swish of a skirt told that Mrs
Ross was walking behind. The two ascended the
first staircase, bringing them to a point where cor-
ridors branched off to the right and left. The first
led to Colonel Champneys' quarters, the second to
the room provided for the women. Hawke pointed
to the left.</p>

<p><q>That's your way,</q> said he, with cold politeness.</p>

<p>Edith Ross remained for a few moments quite
motionless. She was standing as though she did not
hear him. Hawke bent slightly towards her, and
lowering his voice, said:</p>

<p><q>Hasun Khan, I presume, spoke the truth?</q></p>

<p>The significance of Hawke's words could not be
misunderstood. She roused herself, alert, defiant.</p>

<p><q>Hasun Khan will never speak again,</q> was the
swift answer.</p>

<pb n="308"/>
<p><q>Quite true, but there is yet Azimoolah.</q></p>

<p><q>I refer you for information about him to his
friend, Jean Atherton.</q></p>

<p>Her thin lips curved and parted, the white teeth
gleamed. She turned and fled up the staircase.</p>

<p>If any doubt existed in Hawke's mind as to
Edith Ross's feelings towards him, it was now
cleared away. When she made the appeal to him to
kill her it was her last attempt to win him back.
Whether she was sincere or not she had failed, and
it was certain, much as she had once loved Jack
Hawke, she now hated him with all the force of her
passionate, her savage nature.</p>

<p>A sudden apprehension took possession of Jack
Hawke. The vengeance of Edith Ross was a thing
to be feared. What of Jean Atherton? For the
present, having returned to the Begum Kothee, Jean
was out of Edith's reach, but who could fathom the
craft of a jealous woman thirsting for revenge?</p>

<head type="main">At Last</head>

<p>A fortnight went over—a fortnight of intense
anxiety. Only one question was in everybody's
mind—how long would Havelock and rescue be?
No one doubted that the general would try his ut-
most to keep his word, but divided councils might
delay him. Ungad had brought news that Have-
lock's command had been handed over to Outram,
and it was not known that on 16th September
Outram had issued his historic order, chivalrously
waiving his rank and position and handing over to
Havelock the command of the relief operations.</p>

<p>On the 19th the second relief expedition, con-
sisting of 2799 British troops and 400 natives, crossed
to the left bank of the Ganges, and on the 21st began
its march to Lucknow in rain and tempest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the besiegers renewed their activity,
and Hawke, stationed at the Cawnpore battery, had
enough to do. It was clear the rebels were straining
every nerve to force the garrison to surrender before
the arrival of Havelock.</p>

<p>Then suddenly came a prolonged lull. Either the
besiegers were convinced of the failure of their
efforts, or had thought it wise to draw off their forces
to meet the advancing Havelock. Whatever might
be the cause, Hawke was released from duty for a
brief space.</p>

<pb n="310"/>
<p>All this time Hawke had not seen either Jean
Atherton or Edith Ross. Jean was at the Begum
Kothee, and Mrs Ross transferred herself to Dr
Fayrer's house, no doubt, Hawke thought, because
she did not want to meet him.</p>

<p>But there was another reason why she disappeared.
She knew very well that Hawke would discuss the
matter of the letters to Azimoolah with General
Inglis, and that the truth would come out.</p>

<p>This indeed happened. The general told Hawke
he had given the letters to Jean Atherton, as the one
entitled to have them, and went on to question
Hawke about his share in the scandal.</p>

<p><q>My share, sir?</q> cried Hawke, amazed. <q>I swear
to you I had <emph>no</emph> share. I don't know what you mean.</q></p>

<p><q>It's just this, and it's only right you should
know. There were four persons, other than myself,
who read those letters—Lennard, Fulton, Mrs Ross
and yourself.</q></p>

<p><q>Well?</q></p>

<p><q>The matter was one which ought to have been
kept secret. It wasn't. It became common talk.
The poor girl was sent to Coventry by the women.
Women are so charitable towards their own sex,
aren't they?</q> said the general, shrugging his
shoulders. <q>It was too bad. Miss Atherton told
me the story of her acquaintance with Azimoolah
Khan. It was very slight, so far as she was con-
cerned. He pursued her, anyway, and she repulsed
him. Miss Atherton was perfectly candid and out-
spoken, and I believe her. But you know what a
scandal is out here—you've had a taste of that same
yourself. It grows like a snowball and nothing can
thaw it.</q></p>

<pb n="311"/>

<p>For the moment Hawke was tempted to tell the
general of Hasun Khan's confession, but what good
would it have done? The death of Hasun Khan
was a fortnight old. The man had been buried
without the slightest medical examination. How or
why he died was not worth a moment's considera-
tion. Hawke could hardly stir up the matter. It
must rest between him and Edith Ross to the bitter
end.</p>

<p><q>The responsibility of starting that scandal about
the girl rests on someone. Lennard and Fulton,
poor fellows, are dead—only you and Mrs Ross
remain. Either you or she must have tittle-tattled.</q></p>

<p><q>My God!</q> cried Hawke fiercely. <q>Do you
suppose I should be such a blackguard?</q></p>

<p><q>No, I don't. Moreover you went away to learn
news of Havelock almost immediately after the
letters were found. We needn't say who originated
the slander. I daresay both of us can guess. Take
my advice, Jack Hawke, let the thing alone. It can
only add to the poor girl's distress to rake it up.</q></p>

<p>Hawke said nothing. His white lips were pressed
tightly together. The malevolence of Edith Ross
was too patent. But at that moment it was not so
much of the jealous woman of whom he was thinking
as of her victim, Jean Atherton. His suspicions had
vanished. How cruelly had he misjudged her. He
quitted the general with the firm resolve to seek
Jean at once.</p>

<p>But the resolve could not be carried out. A fierce
cannonade began with the suddenness the rebels
observed throughout the siege, and Hawke was once
more in the thick of work.</p>

<p>In the meantime all kinds of rumours reached the
<pb n="312"/>
anxious defenders. Their hopes were continually
being raised, only to be dashed. But at last there
was no doubt that Havelock was near the city.</p>

<p>This was on the morning of 23rd September. The
weather had cleared and the sound of artillery in the
direction of Cawnpore was distinctly heard. At two
in the afternoon the reports became quite frequent
and loud. At five P.M. another cannonade was heard,
which lasted for half-an-hour. It appeared much
louder than the former sounds, and excitement began
to run high.</p>

<p>All was now exultation and joy within the garrison.
The natives were at last thoroughly convinced that
succour was at hand. No one was more excited
than Ungad. He literally danced for joy, snapping
his fingers, and exclaiming at each shot, <q xml:lang="hi">Humara
kumpoo agua!</q>—<q>Our troops have come!</q> Then
he scoffed and laughed at his hitherto incredulous
comrades, crying out: <q>Who is the liar now? Who
has been inventing tales and telling lies about Have-
lock sahib and Tytler sahib and Neill sahib and
Barrow sahib?</q></p>

<p>On the morning of the 25th the guns of the reliev-
ing army were heard again, and by ten o'clock
became louder. At half-past eleven the firing ceased,
and soon after numbers of the city people were
observed flying over the bridges, carrying bundles
of property on their heads. The city seemed terribly
disquieted, and the bridge of boats, seen through a
telescope, was crowded with a confused crowd, chiefly
women, all hurrying to seek safety out of Lucknow.
An hour later the flight became more general, and
many sepoys, matchlockmen, and irregular cavalry
troops crossed the river in full flight, many by the
<pb n="313"/>
bridge, but more throwing themselves into the river
and swimming across it.</p>

<p>The guns of the Redan battery, and those of the
other posts commanding the river, opened fire upon
the fugitives, and this was the signal for a retaliation
of a fiercer character than the garrison had ever
before experienced. On every side came a perfect
hurricane of shot and shell. Fragments of iron and
lead missiles were falling everywhere, and the interior
of the much-battered Residency was visited by round-
shot in places which had never been previously
reached.</p>

<p>Strict orders were given that no one was to stir
outside the various posts, but Jean could not restrain
her impatience. She managed to elude the guard
of the Begum Kothee, and stole forth to the Residency.
It was not so much that she would be able to see
better what was going on in the city as that she
might be under the same roof as Jack Hawke.</p>

<p>At four P.M. a report came that some officers, dressed
in shooting coats and solah caps, a regiment of
Europeans in blue pantaloons and shirts, and a
bullock battery were approaching the Motee Mahal.
At five P.M. volleys of musketry, rapidly growing
louder, were heard in the city.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, and the troops were seen
fighting their way through one of the principal
streets; and though men fell at almost every step,
yet nothing could withstand their headlong gallantry.</p>

<p>In a few hours all doubts and fears were ended.
The garrison's long pent-up feelings of anxiety and
suspense burst forth in a succession of deafening
shouts. From every pit, trench, and battery, from
behind the sandbags piled on shattered houses, from
<pb n="314"/>
every post, rose cheer on cheer—even from the
hospital. Many of the wounded crawled forth to
join in that glad chorus of welcome to those who had
so bravely come to the assistance of the besieged, so
long and so sorely tried. It was a moment never to
be forgotten.</p>

<p>It was immediately after the garrison caught sight
of their rescuers that Neill fell. Then guns came up
and once more the brave fellows pushed on through
the narrow street which led up to the Baillie Guard
of the Residency. The Highlanders came first,
Brasyer's Sikhs followed next. Havelock and Out-
ram, with the staff officers, headed the advance.</p>

<p>In all that fierce fighting nothing was seen like
the savagery with which the soldiers were met.
The natives knew that upon their beating back the
relieving force everything depended, and they fought
like demons. From the side streets, from the front,
from every window and balcony, from the top of
every house, poured an incessant hailstorm of bullets,
to which there was no possibility of reply. There
was one thing to do and one only, to press onwards,
onwards, onwards.</p>

<p>The natives, sepoys, and townspeople, crouching
on the flat roofs, crept forward, fired down into the
street, and hastily drew back to load. The women
even, shrieking in their passion, seized muskets;
others hurled down on the passing soldiery stones
and missiles of various kinds.</p>

<p>Deep trenches had been dug across the road to
hinder their advance and detain them under fire.
The road was studded with all manner of obstacles—
palisades, guns, stockades, barricades. From every
side street poured a withering volley. The carnage
<pb n="315"/>
was terrible. Desperate at their frightful losses, the
men rushed to the loopholes within their reach and
fired into them. They could do nothing else.</p>

<p>Instances of individual heroism abounded. A
Highlander, Sandy <choice><reg>McGrath</reg><orig>M‘Grath</orig></choice>, was shot through the
back and fell; but, wounded as he was, he crawled on
a hundred yards before a second bullet laid him low
for ever.</p>

<p>Glandell and <choice><reg>McDonough</reg><orig>M‘Donough</orig></choice> were two staunch com-
rades. <choice><reg>McDonough</reg><orig>M‘Donough</orig></choice>'s leg was shattered by a bullet.
In <choice><corr>an</corr><orig>in</orig></choice> instant Glandell raised his wounded chum on
his back and trudged on. Nor while doing this did
he forgot to fight. When the chance offered to fire
a shot, Glandell propped his wounded comrade against
some wall, and potted one of the enemy; and then he
picked up <choice><reg>McDonough</reg><orig>M‘Donough</orig></choice> again, and staggered on till
shelter was reached.</p>

<p>Nor were the Sikhs behindhand. They were
ordered to storm a gateway, and they went at it with
a rush. This gateway opened, in the usual Hindoo
manner, by the withdrawal of a big wooden bolt
operated from a round hole in the gate. A Sikh
thrust his right hand through to slide back the bar, and
it was instantly cut off by some rebel inside. The
fearless soldier immediately put in his other hand and
opened the gate.</p>

<p>For nearly three-quarters of a mile this passage of
death was endured, and it seemed never-ending; but
suddenly those in the rear heard a sound which
thrilled them and inspired fresh courage. The fore-
most men could see the battered Baillie Guard Gate,
and could hear the frenzied shouts of welcome, not
only from the men inside, but the women too.</p>

<p>With a final rush the head of the column reached
<pb n="316"/>
the Baillie Guard Gate; but there was no entry there,
for the gateway had long since been filled up with
earth.</p>

<p>But at the side of the gate they found an entrance,
battered by shot and shell, yet mounting the gun
with which Captain Aitken had many a time dealt
death and destruction, still sound and stable.</p>

<p>Directly <q>Jock</q> Aitken and his gunners saw the
head of the column approaching, with Outram on his
Australian horse—which strangely enough, in spite
of its size, had come through the fire scathless—they
raised a stentorian cheer, and commenced hauling
back the gun.</p>

<p>Outram and his Highlanders shouted in response,
and Outram rode at the embrasure; but the big
horse did not like the look of the rough ascent. But
there were a hundred willing arms near, and somehow,
amid deafening shouts, man and horse were pushed,
dragged—who can tell how it was done?—up the
rugged incline, and the next minute were inside
the Residency lines of defence.</p>

<p>The Residency was relieved, the garrison saved!</p>

<p>Havelock and his men were not long in following.
The entrance was widened with pick and shovel and
in swarmed the frantic soldiers, half drunk with ex-
citement, not with liquor, for very little had they had
to drink that perilous day.</p>

<p>There they were, dusty, black with powder, their
uniforms torn, many of them with blood-stained rags
round their arms, their legs, their heads.</p>

<p>But there was no thought of self at that moment.
They had cut their way into the Residency; they
had reached the dearly bought goal at last! The
Highlanders were half mad with joy. They clasped
<pb n="317"/>
the hands outstretched to meet them, exclaiming:
<q>God bless you!</q> <q>We thought to have found only
your bones!</q> <q>And the children are living, too!</q>
The enthusiastic fellows were almost incoherent with
delight, and stopped all they met to shake hands and
ply them with questions.</p>

<p>Then they were taken to Dr Fayrer's house, into
which Havelock and Outram had entered. The ladies
of the garrison, with their children, were assembled in
the outside porch when the Highlanders approached.
There was another scene of enthusiasm. The rough
and bearded warriors shook the ladies by the hand,
took the children up in their arms, and, fondly caress-
ing them, passed them from one to another to be
caressed in turn, kissing them, with tears rolling down
their cheeks, and thanking God they had come in
time to save them from the fate of those at Cawn-
pore.</p>

<p>The sorely tried, enfeebled men and women of the
garrison were not less touched and overcome. There
were gaunt, pallid men, whose hollow eyes shone
weirdly in the torchlight, and whose thin hands
trembled with weakness in the sinewy grasp of the
Highlanders. Many had crawled up from the hospital
to greet their rescuers.</p>

<p>The women, ever thoughtful of others, when the
first greetings were over, busied themselves rushing
about to give the poor wearied soldiers drinks of
water, for they were now perfectly exhausted; and
tea was made in the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">tyekhana</foreign> of Dr Fayrer's house,
of which a large party of officers gratefully partook.
There was no milk, no sugar, and there was nothing
to give them to eat; but this did not matter. Every-
one's tongue seemed going at once, with so much to
<pb n="318"/>
ask and to tell, and the faces of utter strangers beamed
upon each other like those of dearest friends and
brothers.</p>

<p>The garrison, it is true, was not in that starving
condition which Havelock feared; still, the food was
meagre and of the coarsest description. But there
were a few delicacies left, and these were brought out
in honour of Havelock and Outram.</p>

<p>Havelock was the guest of Mr Gubbins, and was
regaled, as he himself wrote, <q>not only with beef cut-
lets, but with mock-turtle soup and champagne.</q></p>

<p>Outram and his chief of staff, Colonel Napier—
afterwards Lord Napier of Magdala—both wounded,
became inmates of the house of their old friend Dr
Fayrer, the Residency surgeon, who placed them in
beds opposite each other in the long room of his
residence.</p>

<p>The loss Havelock's force had suffered was terrible,
but far less than might have been expected, consider-
ing the circumstances. Yet it might have been still
less had Havelock awaited the return of Lieutenant
Moorsom, who had been sent out to see if the thorough-
fares were open by the side of the Chuttee Menzil
Palace.</p>

<p>Moorsom was too late to prevent Havelock's
advance with the Highlanders and Sikhs, but he
saved the other regiments from slaughter. Under
his guidance—for he knew every inch of the ground—
the column altered its direction, and he led it in com-
parative immunity by a sheltered yet more direct
route past the palace straight to the Baillie Guard
Gate, which the head of the column reached while the
Highlanders were still fraternising with the garrison.</p>

<p>By midnight most of the infantry and some of the
<pb n="319"/>
guns constituting the column which had followed
Moorsom were inside the Residency defences, with
scarcely any mishap to bewail.</p>

<p>The news of the entry of Havelock and Outram
flashed like lightning through the various posts,
and, for the first time since the siege, friend could
greet friend without danger. No longer cooped up
for fear of the enemy's bullets, the occupants of the
batteries rushed out in all the joy of freedom.</p>

<p>Hawke, no longer wanted at the Cawnpore battery,
ran to the Begum Kothee. Almost the first person
he met was Jean Atherton. She blushed rosy red
and then went deadly white. He thought she was
about to faint, and instantly his arm went round
her.</p>

<p>It was the best thing he could have done. The
slight barriers of restraint were snapped. Both were
eager for frank explanation.</p>

<p><q>I thought I should never see you again,</q> said
Jean agitatedly. <q>I went in search of you. You
were gone. I—I wanted to tell you about those
terrible letters.</q></p>

<p>Hawke looked down into her clear brown eyes.</p>

<p><q>Why tell me anything?</q> he whispered. <q>Let
us forget all about them. I only want to think of
you as you are. What does anything else matter ?
I love you, Jean—and you love me. Yes, you do.
Confess it.</q></p>

<p>There was triumph in his voice. He drew her
closer and closer, his lips were pressed to hers. She
did not repulse him. Hawke was right. She loved
him.</p>

<p>A heavy step was heard in the corridor without.
A soldier was in search of Hawke. The man had
<pb n="320"/>
brought a written message from the general. Hawke
was ordered to go out into the streets of Lucknow,
with a search party, to bring in the wounded. It
was hard luck the order came at such a moment.
It was grand luck it did not come a few moments
before. Hawke straightened himself. He was the
soldier once again.</p>

<p>Then—a convulsive sob—a tender embrace—Jean
was alone.</p>

</div>


<div n="23" type="chapter">
<pb n="321"/>
<head type="num">Chapter <num type="cardinal" value="23">XXIII</num></head>
<head type="main">Retribution</head>

<p>Hawke's mission bristled with danger. In his old
disguise as a native he presented himself to Lieu-
tenant Johnson, one of Havelock's officers, who was
in command of the party. A few words sufficed to
explain.</p>

<p>The moon was shining brilliantly as the little
column issued through the Baillie Guard gateway,
from which the block of earth had now been removed.
Each man led a horse, on which a wounded man
could be placed. Silently they tramped along the
street which but a few short hours since had been
a path of blood.</p>

<p>Everyone was astonished at the disappearance of
the enemy. The natives appeared to be paralysed
at the heroic feat performed by our men. Not a
shot was fired. Johnson and his little force might
have traversed the whole city in safety. The sepoys
and the townsmen were thoroughly cowed.</p>

<p>The streets were strewn with corpses, and among
them were many of the wounded soldiery. These
were placed on the horses; and taken back to the
Residency. The rest of the force proceeded till they
were brought to a halt by the high walls of the
Chuttee Menzil Palace.</p>

<p>The Chuttee Menzil consisted of a number of very
handsome, lofty buildings, the chief structure impos-
<pb n="322"/>
ingly situated on the banks of the Gumti. The
palace was conspicuous, especially on account of its
<foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">chuttee</foreign>, an umbrella-shaped dome, which, covered
with gold, glittered in the sun at a great height
above the buildings. The entire palace was sur-
rounded by a high masonry wall.</p>

<p><q>I shall go no farther,</q> said Johnson. <q>The
rearguard's in possession of the Motee Mahal. Its
duty is to look after the wounded on the other side
of the Chuttee Menzil.</q></p>

<p><q>But why shouldn't the rearguard take its wounded
to the Residency now? There's no opposition, and
the task will be an easy one,</q> exclaimed Hawke.</p>

<p><q>I've no orders. I daren't go beyond my instruc-
tions,</q> answered Johnson.</p>

<p><q>But, hang it, man! If we allow daylight to show
the enemy the smallness of our numbers, they'll
renew the attack.</q></p>

<p>But Johnson was not to be persuaded. He had
no orders.</p>

<p><q>Then I shall go on alone,</q> Hawke declared.</p>

<p><q>Very well; do as you like.</q></p>

<p>The lieutenant shouted the word of command, and
his men wheeled round.</p>

<p><q>Good luck to you, old chap!</q> said Johnson.</p>

<p>They shook hands, and Hawke went on alone.</p>

<p>His journey along those silent streets was ghastly
enough. When accompanied by the steady tramp
of disciplined soldiers the horror was lessened, but
now that he was alone the sights he saw sickened
him. The slaughter must have been terrible.</p>

<p>The silence and the emptiness impressed him as
much as anything. It might have been a city of the
dead for anything one knew to the contrary.</p>

<pb n="323"/>
<p>Suddenly he saw in the distance a figure emerge,
as it seemed, from the wall of the Chuttee Menzil
Palace. Doubtless there was a door which was not
observable from the spot where he was.</p>

<p>The figure was that of a man—a native and a
Mohammedan, by his beard and moustache. He
turned towards Hawke. In a minute or two they
must meet.</p>

<p>They came face to face. Indeed, the street was
so narrow they could hardly help doing so, unless
each touched against the opposite wall. As though
obeying the same impulse, they stopped and looked
each other in the eyes.</p>

<p>In an instant all the blood in Hawke's body
seemed to rush to his brain. That wily face, the
glittering, snake-like eyes, the cruel, treacherous,
sensual mouth—they were photographed in his
memory. He saw before him the bloodthirsty
fiend whose mind conceived and whose tongue com-
manded the massacre of the women and children at
Cawnpore—it was Azimoolah Khan!</p>

<p><q>Dog! Devil!</q> yelled Hawke.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan started, bounded back, and the
next moment the blade of his sword, keen as a razor,
was seen flashing in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Hawke, with his teeth set, and his eyes flashing,
dashed at his adversary. The Mohammedan was a
skilled swordsman, but he could not withstand the
fury of the Englishman's attack. In the second of
two rapid thrusts, Hawke's sword went through his
adversary's neck, and pinned him against the wall.
His right arm made an effort to raise his sword, but
fell nerveless. His dark face, writhing in the death
agony, was hideous. A spasm, followed by a rush
<pb n="324"/>
of blood, and all was over. The infamous Azimoolah
Khan, whose black deeds there is no word to
adequately characterise, was dead.</p>

<p>One glance to make sure he had done his work
thoroughly, and Hawke rushed on. He had no
time to lose. The Motee Mahal was quite half-a-
mile away on the outskirts of the city. Between
were gardens, isolated buildings situated in com-
pounds, and walled squares.</p>

<p>We need not follow in detail the terrible story
of the rearguard in their attempts to reach the
Residency; of the fatal mistake of their guide,
who missed his direction and led them to disaster;
of the heroism of the little band and of their ultimate
rescue by the relieving force from the Residency, in
all the experiences of which Jack Hawke took a
characteristic part. Suffice it to say that, having
joined the rearguard, he was one of that devoted
band who, cooped up in a square bordered by sheds,
went through the ordeal of one of the most savage
and determined onslaughts recorded in the history
of the siege. Driven into these sheds, which afforded
them their only shelter, most of the gallant defenders
had given themselves up for lost. Danger, however,
made no difference to Hawke, and with that reckless-
ness which was part of his nature he coolly went out-
side to reconnoitre, indifferent to the risk he ran. No
doubt his native dress protected him, for he stood
there watching quite calmly. The square was half
deserted by the sepoys. Here and there were the
charred remains of the <foreign xml:lang="hi" rend="roman">dhoolies</foreign>, some of them still
smoking. The smell was intolerable. Near the
archway a large fire was burning, and the archway
itself was blocked up with a crowd of armed men.
<pb n="325"/>
The tramp of many feet could be heard in the
distance.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the shed arose a shout of
<q>Europeans! Europeans!</q> and then the poor
fellows gave one loud cheer. They made sure a
relief force was advancing, and they wanted their
rescuers to know where they were imprisoned.</p>

<p>The crowd of men in the archway parted. There
was a smothered cry, an exchange of angry words
in Hindustani, and a woman in native dress burst
from the grasp of those who sought to detain her,
and ran into the square. She looked about her in
a bewildered fashion, and then, seeing Hawke, ran
towards him and flung her arms about his neck.
It was Edith Ross.</p>

<p><q>At last!—at last!</q> she breathed gaspingly. <q>I
may not live. Will you let me die at your side?</q></p>

<p><q>You?</q> said he. But there was no reproach in
his voice.</p>

<p><q>I never thought to find you alive. The soldiers
from the Residency are coming. I knew where you
were. I have been on your footsteps since you started.</q></p>

<p>In her fierce exultation at finding him alive, she
thought not of the bullets of the enemy. She clung
to him convulsively, as if to be certain it was he, and
not his ghost.</p>

<p>One man slinking past caught the sound of
English voices. It was enough. In a moment his
piece was at his shoulder. Hawke's back was
towards him. The woman saw the danger. She
uttered a warning shriek, and flung herself round,
receiving the bullet which was meant for the man
whom she thought she hated, but whom she had
never ceased to love.</p>

<pb n="326"/>
<p>Her pallid lips moved.</p>

<p><q>I had thought to die with you, but it is <emph>for</emph> you
after all,</q> she murmured. <q>Hold me close to you
—close. Oh, my God, forgive—forgive—for——</q></p>

<p>The sound died away in a sigh, the eyelids opened
wide; the eyes, fixed on Hawke's face, momentarily
brightened; a look of unutterable yearning flashed
into them; and then they grew dull.</p>

<p>In spite of her wickedness, Hawke's heart was
wrung with pity. He read in those yearning filmy
eyes her last desire. He raised her and kissed her
lips; and with that kiss her spirit was wafted away.</p>

<p>Gently Hawke laid the woman down, and looked
round for the sepoy who had fired the fatal shot.
The latter was breathing his last, pierced through
the heart. Into the square were crowding scores of
British soldiers, cheering as they came, gallant
Lieutenant Moorsom at their head. The sorely
tried little band of heroes who had so long withstood
the attack of hundreds was saved.</p>

<p>With the advent of Havelock, the siege of Lucknow
virtually, if not actually, ended. It is true the rein-
forced garrison dared not assume the offensive, but
they extended their boundaries, strengthened their
defences, and, blockaded for seven weeks, waited
patiently the arrival of Sir Colin Campbell. As for
the enemy, they were powerless to inflict any serious
injury.</p>

<p>On the 16th November Sir Colin entered the
Residency. He decided that the position was a false
one; and on the 22nd the garrison moved out to the
<choice><reg>Dilkoosha</reg><orig>Dilkhoosha</orig></choice> Palace and the Alumbagh.</p>

<p>Havelock, stricken with a mortal illness, had been
<pb n="327"/>
carried out in a litter two days before; and on the
24th, when the march back to Cawnpore began, he
died. He was carried in the litter in which he died
as far as the Alumbagh, where he was buried in the
enclosure under a mango-tree, on the bark of which
was cut the letter <q>H.</q></p>

<p>The whirligig of time brings about strange revenges.
Jack Hawke, the old scandal forgotten, came to be
honoured among the honoured, and it was a proud
moment for him when he, Major Hawke, V.C., amid
the enthusiastic congratulations of friends and com-
rades, led from the cathedral church of Calcutta his
bonnie Jean.</p>
