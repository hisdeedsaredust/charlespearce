<head>Introduction</head>

<p>The murder mysteries dealt with in these pages
are confined to those belonging to England
together with five American tragedies, all of which
possess unusual features. It is hardly necessary to
point out that one's interest in a murder is not
centred in the murder itself, but in its attendant
circumstances, in its environment, and, above all, in
its connection with living personages. For these
reasons each case in the present compilation has
been selected because of its dramatic elements, with-
out which a murder is little more than a brutal,
sordid, and repulsive episode. The majority of the
cases are unsolved murder mysteries, pure and
simple, and speculation as to their solution has not
been attempted. One section, <q>Motiveless Murders,</q>
as its title implies, baffles explanation, and the cases
cited form a fascinating group because of their utter
blankness. Another section is devoted to <q>Romantic
Tragedies.</q> In this, romance is so mingled with
mystery that it is hard to decide where one ends
and the other begins. <q>Shop Murders</q> brings its
<pb n="8"/>
own puzzles, and <q>Self-convicted Poisoners</q> embodies
surprises which may astonish many who have not
followed the operations of these dealers in death.
The <q>Mistakes of Murderers</q> comprises realistic
melodramas which surpass the inventiveness of a
master of stagecraft, and <q>The Last Resource,</q>
embodying as it does the futile efforts of desperate
men to conceal the evidence of their guilt, completes
a cycle of criminal annals which in some respects
may perhaps be claimed as unique.</p>

<head type="super">Unsolved Murder Mysteries</head>
<head type="main">A Secret of <abbr>St.</abbr> James's Palace</head>

<p>It was three o'clock in the morning of Thursday,
the 31st of May, 1810. The watchman who
patrolled <abbr>St.</abbr> James's Street and Pall Mall paused,
lantern in hand, at the arch leading to the courtyard
of the squat, rambling, red-brick Palace of <abbr>St.</abbr> James,
swung his light inside the vaulted gateway and passed
on towards Piccadilly. All was well.</p>

<p>So no doubt thought the porter who was dozing
in his roomy leather-covered, hooded chair in the
entrance hall. His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland
was safely housed--he had been to a dinner
at Greenwich, then to a concert at the Opera House
in aid of the Royal Society of Musicians and he
returned to the palace about midnight.</p>

<p>The duke had three valets, of whom two were
Neale, an Englishman, and Sellis (or Sellies), an
Italian. It was a rule of the household that only the
valet on duty should sleep in the Royal apartments,
but on the night of May 30th there was a deviation.
Neale was the valet on duty, and Sellis was
<pb n="10"/>
sleeping in a room in the ducal suite instead of his
own quarters in a distant part of the palace.</p>

<p>This variation of the routine was not due to any
order of the duke but to Sellis himself, no doubt with
the consent of his master. The duke, as will be seen
later on, must have known that Sellis was sleeping
within call. In view of what happened during the
small hours of Thursday morning, the movements and
the behaviour of Sellis previous to the terrible tragedy
enacted within the duke's apartments and his general
character are of extreme importance.</p>

<p>The Italian was married and had four children.
He was devotedly attached to his family, regular and
domesticated in his habits, always cheerful and good
humoured. Of the three valets, Sellis was the duke's
favourite, so much so that His Grace and one of the
princesses were godparents to his youngest child.</p>

<p>On that tragic night, in consequence of the illness
of one of his children, Sellis arranged to sleep in his
room in the duke's apartments. He was a capital
cook and before leaving his quarters he prepared his
own supper. Then followed the customary cheerful
chat; and kissing his wife he bade her good night
and went off to the duke's suite of rooms. These
extended nearly the entire length of the palace, over-
looking Cleveland Row.</p>

<p>At about a quarter-past three, the hall porter was
still comfortably snoozing, when he was violently
awakened by someone seizing his arm. He opened
his sleepy eyes and saw Neale, the English valet,
standing in front of him, pale and trembling, and
holding in his hand a sabre from which blood was
dripping.</p>

<pb n="11"/>

<p><q type="spoken">Get up, get up!</q> cried Neale, agitatedly. <q type="spoken">His
Royal Highness is murdered.</q></p>

<p>This, however, was but the exaggeration of fright,
for at that moment the duke himself, half dressed
and with blood on his face, was seen in the dim light
descending the staircase, and looking like some ghastly
spectre.</p>

<p><q type="spoken">Let all the doors be guarded. No one must leave
the palace,</q> he exclaimed. <q type="spoken">Neale, I am fainting.
Help me back to my room.</q></p>

<p>The porter, no longer drowsy, summoned the
household. Bells clanged, flickering candles cast
grotesque shadows, scantily dressed men-servants
hurried in all directions, frightened maids screamed.
In the midst of the turmoil was heard the duke's
voice:</p>

<p><q type="spoken">Where is Sellis? Call him at once.</q></p>

<p>A posse of servants rushed to the room where it
was known the valet was sleeping, and hammered at
the door. There was no response.</p>

<p><q type="spoken">Sellis, the duke is murdered,</q> shouted one of
the men.</p>

<p>Still an ominous silence. It was thought that, in
spite of the arrangements to sleep in the duke's suite,
Sellis might be in his own apartments after all. A
hurried scamper thither, only to find that the man
was not with his family; a race back to the duke's
quarters, and a renewed knocking at the valet's
door.</p>

<p>Structurally, the interior of <abbr>St.</abbr> James's Palace was
that of a rabbit warren. Six rooms intervened
between the duke's bed chamber and Sellis's apart-
ment. They followed each other in this order:
<pb n="12"/>
Duke's bed chamber, west yellow room, ball room,
east yellow room, armoury, bed chamber, dressing
room. Then came a very short passage with three
steps descending to the door of Sellis's room. It
was at this door that the servants first knocked.
They found it fastened and there was no response.</p>

<p>Suddenly someone recollected that the room had
another door. By this door the duke's chamber
could be reached by going through three rooms only.
Back rushed the excited little crowd to the east yellow
room and thence into a lobby separating Sellis's apart-
ment from the steward's room, and into which the
other door of the valet's bed chamber opened. The
bed was situated near this door, and as the group drew
near the entrance they involuntarily stopped, their
hearts icy with terror. A sinister sound--a strange
gurgling noise as that of a man in the agony of death--
was coming in gasps from the interior. Not one of
that little group of terrified domestics, with blanched
faces, had the courage to open the door.</p>

<p><q type="spoken">Call the guard!</q> faltered one.</p>

<p>The idea was acted upon. The yeomen of the
guard hastened to the scene and found their way into
the room, the door, unlike the first one, not being
locked. Here they came face to face with an appalling
sight. Sellis was lying perfectly straight in bed, the
head raised up against the headboard and nearly
severed from the body. His arms were lying quite
straight by his sides and blood covered the under
part of the body. He had on his shirt, waistcoat,
breeches, and stockings. The inside of his hands
were perfectly clean, but on the outside were smears
of blood.</p>

<pb n="13"/>

<p>His watch was hanging up over his head, wound
up, his coat was carefully folded inside-out, and laid
over the back of a chair. The washbasin was in the
stand, and was half full of bloody water. Upon
examining Sellis's cravat, it was found to be cut. The
cravat was lined with silk, padded and quilted; and
what was remarkable, both the padding and the
cravat were slit, as if some person had made an attempt
to cut the throat with the cravat on; then, finding
the woollen or cotton padding impeded the razor,
took it off in order the more readily to effect his
purpose.</p>

<p>In the meantime, what of the duke? He was
being attended to by the doctors, Sir Henry Halford
and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Everard Home, who pronounced his hurts
to be severe but not dangerous.</p>

<p>This summary represents the story in brief based
on what purports to be the evidence of the witnesses.
An analysis of this evidence, however, shows much
that was vague and contradictory, not a little of it
was altogether inexplicable, and certainly opposed
to the verdict of the coroner's jury, who found a
verdict of <foreign xml:lang="la">felo-de-se</foreign> against Sellis.</p>

<p>Not a moment was lost in investigating the mys-
terious affair. Indeed so much haste was shown that
it is fair to assume the authorities were extremely
anxious to get rid of the unpleasant business as soon
as possible. There were, indeed, good reasons not
only for hurry, but for keeping in the background
anything which might lead people outside the court
to form their own conclusions. The duke's reputation
was of the worst. His character and conduct had been
more frequently brought before the public than those
<pb n="14"/>
of any other member of the Royal Family, and there
were dark hints of certain circumstances concerning
him about which the less said the better.</p>

<p>Nothing favourable either in his character or appear-
ance can be said about the Duke of Cumberland save
that he had more brains than any of his Royal brothers.
Stockmar describes him as <q type="written">a tall, powerful man
with a hideous face; can't see two inches before
him; one eye quite turned out of its place.</q> He
was a source of trouble to his father; he was shunned
by the other dukes, and the only members of the family
who cared for him were the Regent, over whom he had
great influence, and his sister the Princess Elizabeth.
Few writers on the lives of the sons of George III
have a good word for the duke. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Crawford
in her <title>Victoria Queen and Ruler</title> says: <q type="written">There was a
dread among all who wished for a better England &#x2026;
of the Duke of Cumberland ascending the throne.
He was at once a bad man and a bad fellow, and a
debauchee and a ruffian. The active principle of his
being was malevolence. He gave a constant example
of that form of wickedness which the Germans call
<foreign xml:lang="de"><choice><corr>schadenfreude</corr><sic>schadenfrinde</sic></choice></foreign>, or happiness at witnessing the misery
of another person.</q> His brother Clarence said: <q type="spoken">He
is not a bad sort. Only if he knows where you
have a tender spot on your foot he likes to tread
upon it.</q></p>

<p>The year 1810 was a particularly unpleasant one
for the Royal Family. The scandal of the Duke of
York and the notorious <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Clarke, the year before,
had caused a great sensation; the treatment of the
Princess of Wales by her husband was a constant
dish of gossip; and that the most hated of all the
<pb n="15"/>
dukes should be dragged into association with murder
and suicide must have thrown all his relatives and
the supporters of Royalty into a tremor of apprehen-
sion as to what might be brought to light.</p>

<p>A few hours after the tragedy, an official investigation
commenced. The depositions of the various
witnesses were taken--not before the coroner, but
by the Privy Council, a magistrate, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> John Read,
assisted by the chief of police at Bow Street. The
police, so far as they were represented by the Bow
Street runners, had nothing to do with the matter.
The coroner, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> S. T. Adams, may have been present
at these proceedings, but there is no definite mention
of this. The first examination was conducted in
private, and neither newspaper reporters nor the
public were admitted.</p>

<p>It is not without significance that the reports sent
to <title>The Times</title>, the <title>Morning Post</title> and the <title>Morning
Chronicle</title> were practically identical, in other words,
a report was prepared officially and issued officially.
Official reports in those days of the doings (and mis-
doings) of Royalty were not models of accuracy. When
necessary they were <soCalled>cooked,</soCalled> and the public rarely
accepted them as truthful. With the newspapers it
was different. Their existence was dependent upon
standing well with the authorities, especially in regard
to anything concerning Royal personages. The
officials who drew up the document for publication
had not the slightest doubt that Sellis had first
attempted to murder the duke, and failing to do so had
committed suicide fearing detection. So it came about
that the newspapers took the same line and expressed
their horror at the crime and their detestation of the
<pb n="16"/>
black ingratitude of the murderer. The <title>Morning
Post</title>, indeed, posing as the champion of the Royal
Family, and seething with indignation, indulged in
a patriotic outburst, in the course of which it said:
<q type="written">Of all the European countries, we confess our dislike
of the Italians is the most keen and inextinguishable
We did not want this most glaring and abominable
instance of the foul association of so many detestable
vices to confirm and justify our aversion to that race
of men.&#x2026; The preference given to foreigners
to the prejudice of native worth and fidelity &#x2026; is
a shame and a scandal against which in the name of
our country we most solemnly protest.</q> These
sentiments, no doubt, were held by a large section
of the community, for somehow the popular belief of
most English people in those days was that foreigners,
and especially Italians, went about with daggers and
stilettos which they were ready to use on the slightest
provocation. It did not therefore need much proof
that Sellis, being an Italian, was also likely to be a
murderer.</p>

<p>Admitting, however, for the sake of argument that
Sellis was guilty, the question of his motive and of
his plan of assassination presented difficulties which
the newspapers could not overcome, and having only
cut-and-dried evidence before them they could but
fall back on conjecture. This cut-and-dried evidence
was presented at what was termed the coroner's
inquest, held on June 1st, the day after the murder--
an inquest conducted in a fashion which would hardly
be tolerated at the present day. It was alleged that
the coroner's officer, instead of summoning the jury
personally, went to <q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Francis Place of Charing
<pb n="17"/>
Cross, man's mercer,</q> and, to quote the affidavit of
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Adams put in at the trial of an action for libel
which was brought some twenty-two years later,
and which will be dealt with further on: <q type="written">The said
Francis Place then mentioned to the officer the names
of many persons fit and eligible to compose such jury,
and of such persons so summoned by the officer
aforesaid, an impartial jury was formed of which jury
the said Francis Place was foreman.</q> It was typical
of the mystery and muddle in which the affair was
involved that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Place, a reputable man who, as
a Radical and a strong supporter of that ardent
reformer, Sir Francis Burdett, occupied a recognised
position in political matters, should repudiate the
coroner's statement. He asserted that, so far from
mentioning the names of persons to be summoned,
he only knew five of the seventeen men empanelled.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Adams's method of opening the inquest is
reminiscent of the Queen of Hearts in <title>Alice in Wonder-
land</title>, who sentenced the culprit before she heard the
evidence. The official report reads thus: <q type="written"><abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Adams addressed the jury and informed them of
the violent attack that had been made upon the
Duke of Cumberland, and that there was very little
doubt but it was done by the deceased.</q> And so
before the jury had heard the depositions read, they
were expected to accept the coroner's opinion and
not to trouble to think and judge for themselves!
Maybe some inference of this sort made the coroner
uneasy in his mind, for he went on to intimate that
the witnesses would be called before them and the
depositions would be read; <q type="written">when they would have
an opportunity of altering or enlarging, and the jury
<pb n="18"/>
could put any question to them they thought fit.</q>
No questions, however, could be put to the principal
witness. The Duke of Cumberland was absent,
presumably on account of his wounds, but there was
no suggestion that the proceedings should be adjourned
to allow him to attend. As the coroner had already
settled that Sellis was the duke's assailant, perhaps
this course was not considered necessary.</p>

<p>The interest of the tragedy, however, does not
centre round the duke's evidence but around the
evidence concerning Sellis. It is important to remem-
ber that the principal evidence against the man came
from the mouth of Neale, the English valet, who
was on very bad terms with the Italian. Sellis,
some months before, had written to a member of the
Royal Household accusing Neale of dishonesty.
<q type="written">This man,</q> wrote Sellis, <q type="written">is as great a villain as
ever existed; no oath or promise is binding with
him, and he relates alike that which he must have
sworn to keep sacred in his bosom as he will a
most trifling thing; and slanders and threatens
with public exposure and large damages his bene-
factor and only maker of his fortune just as he
would one of his own stamp.</q> The ill-feeling be-
tween the two men was well known, and in view
of this fact the story of Neale deserves careful
scrutiny.</p>

<p>More than one version exists of this evidence, and
we prefer to take that contained in <title>The Times</title> of June
2nd. What Neale deposed was that <q type="written">he slept in a
room which was separated from the duke's only by
a thin partition. On Thursday morning he was awakened
about three o'clock by the duke's voice, who
<pb n="19"/>
cried out several times, <q type="spoken">Neale, Neale, Neale, I am
murdered.</q> He instantly started up, and the duke
told him to take care as the murderers were in his
bedroom. The duke was in his shirt all covered over
with blood. He [Neale] immediately seized the
poker, and as he proceeded onwards towards the
yellow room, which was open, he trod upon a naked
sword which was reeking with blood. He took it
up and asked the duke's permission to pursue the
murderers. The duke answered, <q type="spoken">No, no, Neale; for
God's sake do not go from me or leave me alone as
there are more of them in it.</q> The duke then leaned
on his arm and they went downstairs together. The
porter was by this time roused, and the duke directed
him to lock the doors and allow no person to leave
the house. They then met <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Neale, whom the
duke directed to go and alarm Sellis. After this they
returned to the duke's chamber to search for the
assassin. Neale looked into the closet and there he
found Sellis's black leather slippers, a dark lanthorn,
a bottle of water, the scabbard of a sword and two
bolsters; the key of the closet was on the inside.</q>
After alluding to the arrival of the surgeon, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Home,
who found that the duke had been wounded in the
head, the throat, the thigh and the hand, Neale went
on to say that <q type="written">it was plain that the person who
made the attack on the duke must have remained
secreted in the closet, as all the other doors leading
to the duke's apartment were locked. A few days
since Sellis had according to orders taken the duke's
regimentals and sword out to make them ready for
a review which did not afterwards take place. He
afterwards returned the regimentals, but left the
<pb n="20"/>
sword upon the sofa, where it had lain ever since until
the fatal night.</q></p>

<p>From this it is clear that Neale had <q type="emph">reconstructed</q>
the crime to his own satisfaction. But how was it
so clear that the would-be murderer had concealed
himself in the closet? Because, said Neale, all the
doors leading to the apartments of the duke were
locked.</p>

<p>Yet Neale must have known that Sellis had a key
which opened all the doors and that this same key
was found in his coat pocket. This being so, why,
if Sellis was the assassin, should he take the trouble
to conceal himself in the closet and risk the chance
of a discovery when he could have entered the duke's
bedroom at any time? But his slippers and a dark
lanthorn were found in the closet. A man about to
commit a murder would surely consider how to get
away quickly after he had done the deed and would
be careful to leave no clue behind. For what reason
did Sellis take off his slippers? If there <emph>was</emph> any
reason it was certainly most stupid of him to allow
them to remain in the closet. Also the lanthorn.
If such a thing were necessary, it was for guiding the
murderer's movements while in the room of his victim.
But there was no need, since a lamp was burning in
the duke's room. The evidence concerning this
lanthorn was anything but conclusive of its belonging
to Sellis. One of the servants said that she had seen
such a lanthorn (it was a square one) in Sellis's
possession. Other servants described Sellis's lanthorn
as round. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Sellis never knew her husband to have
a lanthorn other than the one in their own private
apartments, which had never been taken away.</p>

<pb n="21"/>
<p>Both the duke and Neale were sure that the wounds
were inflicted by the duke's own sword. Neither
had seen the sword used, but there it was lying on the
ground <q type="written">reeking with blood.</q> And had it not been
lying upon the sofa in the duke's room for some days
<q type="written">until the fatal night</q>? Sellis, according to Neale,
had put away His Royal Highness's regimentals, but
had left out the sword, the inference being that he
wanted to have it handy. Why he should have
taken the scabbard to the closet is a question as
difficult to answer as that relating to the slippers and
lanthorn.</p>

<p>Let us examine the duke's deposition. His account
of the affair differs materially from Neale's. He
stated that he had been awakened about three o'clock
on Thursday morning by two violent blows on the
head, which were immediately after followed by two
others, followed by a hissing kind of noise. From
this circumstance his first conclusion was that a bat
had by some means or other entered his room. There
was a lamp and taper hanging in the chamber, and
by their light he perceived a letter which lay upon
his table completely covered with blood. This immediately
struck him with the idea that there was a
murderer in the room, and he accordingly struggled
as quickly as he could out of bed. At this moment
a naked sabre was dropped upon the floor, and he
perceived the figure of a man flying into the yellow
room and escaping on towards the apartment in
which Sellis slept. He went downstairs, aroused
his page and gave the alarm, through the house, of
murderers.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that in this narrative Neale is
<pb n="22"/>
not mentioned, unless the word <q type="emph">page</q> applies to
him. But this could hardly be, as the duke says
he went <q type="emph">downstairs,</q> and Neale's bedroom was
on the same floor as his own. Neale is circumstantial
enough about the poker and what the duke said to
him, and it is, to say the least, strange that not a word
to corroborate his story appears in the duke's deposition.
It will be noticed that the duke described how
he saw a figure flying into the yellow room <q type="written">escaping
towards the apartments in which Sellis slept.</q> This
is purely a gratuitous assumption. As a matter of
fact, there was no other road open to the <q type="emph">figure</q>
whom the duke saw <q type="emph">flying</q>; but seeing that six
rooms intervened between the west yellow room and
Sellis's quarters, and that there were several exits
to the staircase in the corridor or kitchen court, it
is quite obvious the duke could not say positively
whither the hypothetical figure was fleeing.</p>

<p>According to the account which appeared in <title>The
Times</title> on the discovery of the tragedy, the attack
was a <q type="written">most ferocious one.</q> The alleged assassin
<q type="written">seemed to have stood rather back towards the head
of the bed, which stood in a small recess, in order to
avoid discovery, and was therefore obliged to strike
down at the duke's head in a slanting direction, in
consequence of which the curtains which hung from
the top impeded the action of the sword, and to this
alone can His Royal Highness's preservation be
imputed--several of the tassels of the curtain were
cut off. The sword was a large military sabre of
the duke's and had been sharpened. The whole edge
appeared hacked and blunted with the force of the
blows.</q> If this be true, then it is hard to believe the
<pb n="23"/>
duke could have survived. In any case, his impression
of having received <q type="written">four blows</q> (it will be noted
that he was very precise as to the number), of hearing
a <q type="written">hissing noise</q> which he thought was made by a
bat reads strangely. These four blows were inflicted
by a sabre as sharp as a razor, so runs one statement,
but that on account of this very sharpness it was the
more easily blunted! Whether this be so does not
very much matter. The cuts, if we may accept the
evidence of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Everard Home, the surgeon, were
deep enough to show the pulsation of the brain, and
that being the case, the skull must have been cut
through, but the surgeon does not say so.</p>

<p>How the duke's thigh was cut is as difficult as the
medical evidence to understand. This wound could
hardly have been received while lying down, and as
the sword was dropped while he was struggling to get
out of bed, he could not have been wounded when on
his feet unless the would-be assassin picked up the
weapon and again attacked him. But this hypothesis
will not serve, because the duke says, after the <q type="written">naked
sabre was dropped on the floor</q> he perceived the
flying figure. When, also, was his finger injured?
One account speaks of it occurring while he was trying
to get possession of the sword, but the deposition of
the duke is silent on this point. On the whole, the
duke's story is incomplete, it is contradictory and
unconvincing, and it does not tally with that of
Neale. Defective and unsatisfactory as the narrative
is, it must be left so. Nothing more can be said.</p>

<p>We now come to the crucial question--was Sellis
the guilty man and did he commit suicide? The
fist question is by no means fully answered by the
<pb n="24"/>
depositions of the duke and Neale. The second
demands still more careful consideration.</p>

<p>The story of the valet's body being found stark
on his bed, the throat so deeply cut into the head as
nearly to sever it from the trunk, has already been
told. The first puzzle which presents itself is the
position of the body. It was perfectly straight, the arms
were also straight, were close to his sides, the insides
of the hands were clean, smears of blood were on the
backs. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jackson, one of several surgeons who
saw the body, and the only one who gave evidence
before the coroner, described the wound in the throat
as six inches in length, gaping open an inch and a
half, the windpipe being completely severed. Unconsciousness,
if not death, must have followed within
a few seconds. Strength must have departed instantaneously.
How could anyone in such a state have
composed his arms in so placid a position as that in
which they were found? The razor, it is true, might
have fallen from the fingers at the first agony, but it
was picked up two feet from the bed. That such a
gash could have been inflicted without leaving blood
on the inside of the hands is almost inconceivable.
How is the basin of bloody water to be accounted
for? The explanation was put forward that Sellis,
after coming from the duke's room, had washed his
hands, and if he was the duke's assailant, the explanation
might be accepted. But was he? It will be
remembered that Sellis is represented as being in the
duke's room in his stocking-feet. According to an
anonymous statement, evidently written with a strong
bias against Sellis and with a circumstantiality which
excites suspicion, the duke's blood <q type="written">flew eight feet
<pb n="25"/>
high around the walls of his bed chamber, besprinkling
the portrait of Pichegru and spoiling other pictures
with large drops of blood.</q> Now if this were so there
must have been blood on the floor, and the would-be
murderer's feet could hardly escape being stained.
Sellis's stockings were never examined. Had marks
of blood been found upon them the question of his
guilt would have been solved. On the other hand,
the absence of such marks would have been in favour
of his innocence.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that the object of the investigation
from beginning to end was to establish that Sellis
was a murderer and a suicide, it is not surprising that
no mention was made of the stockings. We may be
sure that had blood been found upon the soles the
fact would not have escaped notice.</p>

<p>Two other points suggest consideration. The first
is the cuts on the cravat. These cuts went through
not only the outside silk but the quilted padding
below. The theory was that, the padding impeding
the passage of the razor, the cravat was taken off to
effect the purpose more readily. Possibly. But was
the hand wielding the razor that of Sellis or some
other person? It must not be forgotten that though
one bedroom door was locked the other was not.
These were the facts, but explanation is wanting.</p>

<p>The second point relates to the position of the body.
It was lying straight on the bed and there was no
sign of struggle or convulsion. The conclusion arrived
at by the investigation was that, having fled to his
room, Sellis was alarmed by the knocking at the door,
and that in a paroxysm of fright and desperation he
took the razor from a drawer and slashed his throat.
<pb n="26"/>
To do this he laid himself on the bed, composed his
limbs, and started upon hacking his throat, after
which he arranged his arms and hands straight out,
one on each side of his body. Does this deliberation
suggest the conduct of a desperate man? We venture
to say it does not.</p>

<p>The opinion of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jackson was not that of other
surgeons who examined the body, but who were not
called before the Privy Council or the coroner. One
of these gentlemen was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carpue, who had a great
reputation as an anatomist and was also well known
as a lecturer on anatomy. The following passage
from the <abbr>Rev.</abbr> Erskine Neale's <title>Life of the Duke of
Kent</title> tells us what he thought: <q type="written"><abbr>Mr.</abbr> C. [Carpue],
a surgeon of note, saw Sellis after his death, and,
having examined his wounds, gave it as his opinion
that the cuts on the back of the neck could not have
been inflicted by the deceased. Nor was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> C.
content with simply giving utterance to this monstrous
[<foreign xml:lang="la">sic</foreign>] assertion, but had the hardihood to make
the subject the basis of a lecture to his pupils, in the
course of which he declared that if Sellis died by his
own hand he did not cut the wound at the back of
his neck. <q type="written">Sellis,</q> he observed, <q type="written">had not one but
several wounds on the back of the head. If Sellis
had meant his own decollation, he must have begun
behind his neck; but labour as he might, it would
only hack and hew his flesh, for no physical strength
would be sufficient to terminate the existence of an
individual by beheading himself.</q></q></p>

<p>From this it is pretty clear why <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carpue was not
called to give evidence. That evidence would have
been dead against the verdict of <foreign xml:lang="la">felo-de-se</foreign>. The
<pb n="27"/>
Royal brothers were greatly incensed at the
surgeon's presumption, and the Duke of Kent,
meeting the offender some little time after, <q>looked
him fairly down and then <emph>rumped</emph> him without
mercy.</q> A brotherly argument, but hardly a convincing
one.</p>

<p>It is not without significance that Neale represented
Sellis as an ill-tempered man; that the past history
of the latter, some twenty years back, before he entered
the duke's service was raked up, but all that was
adduced was that he was once charged with a trifling
act of larceny which was not proved, and that he
had been heard to utter the words: <q type="spoken">To hell with
the King.</q></p>

<p>The witnesses who gave this evidence were servants,
whose ideas of truth are notoriously shaky, and their
trumpery attempts to blacken the man's character
may be summarily dismissed. It was also asserted
that Sellis might have been insane, but for this
supposition there is not the slightest ground. The
doctor who was called to speak on the point declared
that his mind was in no way affected.</p>

<p>All the efforts to dispose of the case summarily as
one of suicide did not stifle public curiosity and
comment, but at last the matter died out, to be revived
twenty years later, when an article purporting to be
a narrative of the actual facts was published in the
<title>Satirist</title>. The writer insinuated that there was a
motive why the duke and Neale should wish to get
rid of Sellis, who, it was alleged, was in possession
of an infamous secret affecting both. The accusation
was based upon a statement supposed to have been
made by a man named Jew who was in the duke's
<pb n="28"/>
service at the time of the tragedy. It was impossible
to remain silent under odious insinuations seriously
made. The duke took proceedings against Josiah
<choice><corr>Phillips</corr><sic>Phillipps</sic></choice>, the proprietor of the <title>Satirist</title>, the man Jew
was produced and denied having made the allegations
referred to, and <choice><corr>Phillips</corr><sic>Phillipps</sic></choice> was found guilty. It ought
to be noted, however, that the duke's account of
what happened given during the action for libel in
1832 differs materially from that contained in His
Royal Highness's deposition of 1810--so materially,
indeed, that it is difficult to reconcile the two.</p>

<p>It was typical of the brutal tastes of the times
that the bedrooms of the duke and his valet should
be thrown open for exhibition. The papers solemnly
recorded how the <q type="written">sheets and white satin pillows
that were on the duke's bed when he was attacked
were put on again to satisfy the curiosity of the
public,</q> while the bed and bedroom of Sellis were
allowed to remain in the same state as when the
tragedy happened. The hot summer weather, however,
put an end to the repulsive show, which, it may be
presumed, was permitted so that everybody should
be convinced that the official reports were correct.
In the meantime, the body of Sellis had been buried
at night in Scotland Yard, where the remains, for
aught we know, lie at this moment, decomposed by
the quicklime which it was the practice to use in
cases of <foreign xml:lang="la">felo-de-se</foreign>. Despite the endeavours made to
attach odium to the memory of the unhappy
man, his widow was granted a pension--an act
which the duke's enemies probably did not regard
as prompted by generosity, but rather as conscience
money.</p>
<pb n="29"/>
<p>Few people who to-day assemble to watch the
trooping of the guard in the courtyard of the Palace
are aware of the dark tragedy enacted within its
walls. Yet for a mystery which baffles all attempts
at a satisfactory solution, it takes a prominent place
in the annals of crime.</p>

<head type="main">Who Killed Benjamin Nathan?</head>
<head type="sub">A New York Horror</head>

<p><q>The story of the Nathan murder remains the
greatest mystery of the age. <q>Murder will
out,</q> they say. If this be true, the query <q>Who killed
Benjamin Nathan?</q> will one day be answered. Men
yet living, who were young and vigorous when it
occurred, have never lost sight of it, and will never
give up the search so long as they are capable of
continuing it.</q> So with pardonable exaggeration
wrote George W. Walling, chief of the New York
Police, in 1887. Thirty-seven years have passed away
since these words were penned, and the mystery
remains as profound as ever. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Walling's prophecy
has not been verified. The search has long ago been
abandoned, but the enigma has not lost its interest.</p>

<p>The most remarkable feature of the Nathan murder
is the confusion by which the tragedy is surrounded.
At every step one encounters difficulties in placing
what occurred in proper sequence, and in reconciling
apparent discrepancies. All the way through are
suspicions and surmises and theories, but the facts
themselves are elusive. It is hardly possible not to
come to the conclusion that the police were very loose
in their method of enquiry. Indeed, there is ground
<pb n="32"/>
for the supposition that this looseness did not arise
from carelessness or incompetency, but from reasons
and motives which have never been brought to light.
Anyway, if the story could not be straightened out
at the time, it is not likely it will be so after a lapse of
more than fifty years. We will, however, attempt to
give a broad outline of the affair, leaving the variations
furnished by the evidence of the several witnesses
to be dealt with later on.</p>

<p>About half-past six on the morning of July 29th
1870, the strange sight was seen of a couple of young
men in their nightshirts--one of the latter heavily
stained with blood--standing on the doorsteps of a
mansion in West Twenty-third Street, New York,
gesticulating and shouting for the police. The few
passers-by ran to the spot, and shortly after came
Mangan, a police officer. <q>My father's been murdered,</q>
cried one of the young men in answer to the
officer. <q>Where is he?</q> asked Mangan. <q>Upstairs
in his room.</q> Mangan, the two men in the nightshirts,
and two or three persons from the little crowd
outside, then ascended to the second floor.</p>

<p>On this floor were two rooms communicating.
One was of a fair size, used as a reception room, the
other was much smaller, and here <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan kept
his business and family papers in a small safe. In
the centre of the larger room was a bed consisting of
four mattresses piled on top of each other on the
floor. No mystery attached to this bed, peculiar
though the arrangement was. The house was in the
hands of carpenters and decorators, and things were
of necessity topsy-turvy. Benjamin Nathan was
a Wall Street broker, and had a country house at
<pb n="33"/>
Morristown, New Jersey. As a rule he stayed there,
it being the summer season, but on the fatal night
of the 28th he had elected to sleep at his town mansion
in the makeshift bed described.</p>

<p>When the police officer, the two young men (they
were Benjamin Nathan's sons, Frederick and Washington)
in nightshirts, and those outsiders who had
pushed their way into the house entered the larger
room on the second floor, they were faced by an appalling
sight. In the passage-way between the two
rooms they saw--but Patrick Govern, a porter at
the Fifth Avenue Hotel, opposite which was <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Nathan's house, may be allowed to describe the scene
as told in his evidence given before the coroner:</p>

<p><q>I saw the body lying in the bedroom, more of it
in the bedroom than in the library (the smaller room);
the feet were in the library, the left leg was drawn up
in an angle to the body; the right leg was stretched
out; the hands were clasped convulsively towards
the head; the body was covered with blood. I then
stepped up to the officer and passed into the library.
I remarked a chair overturned; I turned to the safe;
some drawers were out and some papers were in
them; the key was in the lock; I remarked blood
on each side of the chair and on the carpet.</q></p>

<p>Blood in great quantities was on the body and on
the ground. The old man had been savagely attacked,
and the front and back of the head showed terrible
wounds. These had apparently been inflicted with
some blunt instrument. As if to help the police,
the murderer had left behind him the weapon with
which the murder was committed. It was an iron
bar some twenty inches long, in use among ships'
<pb n="34"/>
carpenters and lumbermen, and known as a <q>dog.</q>
The ends, for some technical purpose, were turned up.</p>

<p>This bar was found in the entrance hall, not by the
police, but by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Frederick Nathan, who, after
admitting the officer, picked it up and showed it to
him. It was smeared with blood and a few grey
hairs were sticking to it. It was taken upstairs to
the scene of the tragedy, for what reason does not
appear. Round this bar a good deal of the confusion
alluded to ranged, as will be seen.</p>

<p>To go back to what Patrick Govern saw. After
looking round the library he returned to the bedroom
and noticed that one of the officers had the <q>dog</q>
in his hand. <q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Frederick Nathan was at the
end of the bed kneeling down by his father; he took
the head in his hands and said something about
<q>Father, when I saw you last I did not think I should
see you like this.</q> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Washington Nathan then
took up a pocket book and opened it and took out a
paper which he pronounced a bond.</q> A few minutes
afterwards <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Kelly, the housekeeper, and her son
came into the room, and Govern described them as
<q>horrified.</q> it is important to note that the four
persons in the house at the time of the murder were
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Benjamin Nathan's two sons, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Kelly and her
son.</p>

<p>It was pretty clear that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan had been
awakened by some noise, had got out of bed to ascertain
the cause, and while approaching the smaller room,
or library, had been struck down. The bed-clothes
were very slightly disturbed and there was no blood
anywhere on the bed itself. On the bed was a drawer
taken from the safe.</p>
<pb n="35"/>
<p>In all probability the first attack was made when
the old man was some four feet or so from the entrance
to the library. On the walls at the corner of the
big room, covering a space of four by three feet, were
several blotches and smears of blood and the imprint
of bloody fingers. One set of these finger-marks was
as distinct as though the person whose hand had
touched the wall had purposely dipped his hand in
blood and placed it there. The other set differed
greatly from the hand of the murdered man, and was
long and ladylike, with well-kept fingers--in short,
that of a gentleman. This is Walling's account, and
if correct it should have furnished a starting-point
for investigation. But in the proceedings before
the coroner as reported in the <title>New York Herald</title> there
is no mention of the <q>long and ladylike hand.</q></p>

<p>Walling also suggests that, while <q>struggling hand-to-hand
with his assailant, old <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan received a
crushing blow and pitched headlong to the floor.</q>
The supposition of a <q>struggle</q> is not borne out by
<abbr>Dr.</abbr> John Beach, who, besides being a medical man,
was also deputy coroner and presumably a trained
observer. His opinion was that there was no struggle,
and that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan never had any opportunity of
giving an alarm. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Beach's theory of what happened
was that death took place when <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan was on
his face in the smaller room. <q>I think,</q> said he,
<q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan was endeavouring to make his escape
on his hands and knees; a man may have sensibility
to endeavour to make his escape and yet not have
any power to make an alarm; my theory about the
succession of wounds is that the wound over the right
eye was struck first, that the blow, not being direct
<pb n="36"/>
but rather of a slanting character, simply produced
partial concussion, rendering him practically unable
to stand, but failing to make him unconscious. While
he was down the wound on the right side of the head
was inflicted; when the chair was thrown down, <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Nathan's head came in contact with it while he was
trying to get up; as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan still tried to get
towards the door, the assassin, thinking his victim
might very soon be able to give the alarm, just as he
got into the large room dealt him a blow from behind,
and the edge of the instrument, resting on the skull,
produced the long wounds.</q></p>

<p>All this is very circumstantial, but of course it rests
upon supposition, and its ground for acceptance is
considerably discounted by the doctor's statement
that <q>the whole appearance of the arms and body
showed that the body had been removed after death,</q>
and that the chair as it was placed was not seen by
him but was shown to him by the police <emph>after</emph> it had
been set upright. Another medical witness also
stated that he thought the body had been <q>moved,</q>
a point which surely should have had investigation,
but it seems to have received none. It is difficult
to avoid coming to the conclusion that the police
all the way through were singularly inept. The
important rule that nothing in the room of such a
tragedy should be touched until examined by the
coroner was quite ignored.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the facts, two at least
are without much doubt--firstly that the <q>dog</q>
was the weapon used, and secondly that death had
taken place some hours before the discovery of the
tragedy. It is also feasible, as <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Beach suggested,
<pb n="37"/>
that although the safe could have been opened noiselessly,
the taking-out of the drawer might have been
accompanied by a screeching noise, and while it was
being removed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan was awakened. Other
conclusions arrived at by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Beach must not be overlooked,
theoretical as they are. The first is that
only one person need have been the assailant;
the second, that he must have had stains on his
clothing; the third, that the work was not a
professional burglar's, and that he was known to
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan.</p>

<p>As to the object of the assassin, it was not unconnected
with robbery, but whether this robbery was
intended to conceal some other motive it is impossible
to say. The murdered man's keys had been taken
from his pockets. The safe was unlocked and from
it had been removed a wooden drawer, box-like in
construction, which contained several rare old gold,
silver and copper coins of value only to collectors.
When the murder was discovered, this drawer, as
already mentioned, was on the pile of mattresses,
and the coins missing. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan generally kept
in the safe money for housekeeping purposes. What
ever there was, it was gone. From the larger room
the murderer had taken a watch and chain and three
diamond studs; a gold stud in the neck of the shirt
was, however, left behind. This is Walling's story,
but so far as the three studs were concerned it does
not find confirmation in the inquest report, in which
one reads that Captain Burnell, a police official, said
that the studs were in the shirt. If Captain Burnell
spoke truly, it would appear either that the murderer
was in a great hurry or overlooked the studs. Anyhow,
<pb n="38"/>
he delayed sufficiently long to wash his hands, as
blood-stained water was found in a basin.</p>

<p>The value of the property stolen was but moderate
and did not warrant the pertinacious savagery of the
robber. It may not be that he had murder in his
mind when he started, but he was certainly prepared
for an encounter, or why did he take with him the
iron bar? This iron bar or <q>dog</q> was not such a
weapon as a professional burglar would use. A
<soCalled>professional</soCalled> would certainly be provided with a
crowbar. A great mystery surrounds the <q>dog</q>
which neither the police nor the coroner were able to
solve. Its nature suggests that it was seized at
random, but it was absolutely impossible it could
have been in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan's rooms previous to the
entry of the assassin. This disposes of the supposition
that when disturbed he found the <q>dog</q> ready to
hand. Why, then, did he select so clumsy a weapon?
It was of no avail for the forcing of a safe and he
had no occasion to use force. Presumably he opened
the safe with the key which he found in the old man's
pocket, and if so, he must have prowled about the
bedroom for some little time before entering the
<soCalled>library.</soCalled></p>

<p>But where did he get the <q>dog?</q> The master
carpenter, his assistant, and a bricklayer, all of whom
had for some time been employed about the house
and had been at work in every room, had never seen
such an instrument, neither had <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Kelly, the
housekeeper. On the other hand, another workman,
a mason, declared that he had noticed a bar like the
one found lying in the stable at the rear of the premises,
but he could not say it was the same. Why the
<pb n="39"/>
murderer, after committing the deed, should have
taken the weapon downstairs and have left it in the
hall, and why policeman Mangan did not notice it
when he entered the house, but had his attention
called to it by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Frederick Nathan, and why it
should have been carried upstairs afterwards by a
constable (whether Mangan or some other is not
quite certain) are questions about which little can
be said save that they add to the general confusion
in which the affair is involved.</p>

<p>However this may be, there was no confusion about
one thing--the police could not find that anyone
had entered the house burglariously. The fastenings
were intact and doors and windows exceptionally
secure. This, on the face of it, threw suspicion on
some of the inmates. Opposed to this suspicion
was the suggestion that someone might have entered
the house while the men were at work, and the doors
or windows open, and then concealed himself. To
support this theory there was not a tittle of evidence.
Indeed, every theory that was started ended in a
blind alley.</p>

<p>We may now proceed to deal with the history of
the Nathans and their family relations, and also to
trace the movements, not only of Benjamin Nathan,
but of his sons Frederick and Washington, on the
night of the murder.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, Benjamin Nathan was a
broker, and also private banker of great fortune. He
had retired from active business, but once or twice
a week in the summer time he came to New York
from his country seat in New Jersey, visited his
office in Wall Street, and went on to his mansion in
<pb n="40"/>
West Twenty-third Street, inspected the progress
of the alterations and occasionally slept on the makeshift
bed. July 28th was one of these occasions.
He purposed sleeping at the mansion because the
following day was the anniversary of his mother's
death and he intended to pass the evening at the
synagogue. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Kelly, the housekeeper, knew that
he was coming and admitted that she told her son
so. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan's two sons, who lived in the house,
also knew that their father would be there, as a
meeting between the three had been arranged in
connection with the synagogue. These sons were
in business, Frederick being a broker like his father,
and Washington a commission agent, in partnership
with another man. The reputations of the young
men were widely different. Frederick was a steady
and plodding man of regular habits, Washington
was regarded as a man of pleasure, and his tastes in
this respect were made the matter of much gossip
during the investigation, but the reports concerning
him were probably exaggerated. Washington's proclivities
occasionally gave his father anxiety, but
their attitude was said to be quite friendly.</p>

<p>The weather on the evening of the 28th threatened
to be stormy. Lightning flashed and the growling
of distant thunder was heard, but there was no rain
during the early part of the night, during which time
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan was occupied in the little room called
the library. Walling, writing in a sentimental vein,
says: <q type="written">The anniversary of his mother's death grew
nearer, and after gazing affectionately at the features
of his beloved parent which were disclosed from the
case of a miniature, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan replaced the
<pb n="41"/>
case in a small safe which stood in the corner of the
little room, locked the iron door, dropped the keys
into his pocket and prepared for rest.</q> All this, of
course, is purely imaginary. No one was with <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Nathan at the time and no one knows what he did.
George Walling, in spite of his thirty years' experience
in detective work and in spite of his position as chief
of the New York Police, is not altogether to be relied
upon, at all events so far as the Nathan affair is
concerned. He does not seem to have had personal
connection with it, nor is there any sign of his having
consulted the evidence given at the coroner's inquest.</p>

<p>When Washington Nathan appeared before the
coroner, intense curiosity was aroused as to what
he would say, because all kinds of speculations had
been indulged in as to how he had passed the evening
after going with his father to the synagogue.</p>

<p>The murder, it was assumed, had been committed
not long after midnight, and Washington had some
three hours to account for. His statement was that
he arrived at the house at a quarter-past six on the
evening of the 28th. He saw his father and went
with him to the synagogue, and returned home at a
quarter-past nine. He then went out and called to
see friends, going with them to various hotels. About
twelve o'clock he returned to his father's house,
locked the front door and, to use his own words,
<q>stayed a second to listen at my father's room door,
and finding that all was quiet I went to my own room
and got into bed. It was then ten minutes past
twelve.</q></p>

<p>The sons' bedrooms were on the floor above that
of their father, and it was Washington's custom to
<pb n="42"/>
visit his father's room when he rose and when he
went to bed. One point in Washington's evidence
is not to be overlooked. Police officer Mangan told
the coroner that a light was burning in the little room
near the window when he entered, but that the
bracket was turned towards the wall so that it could
not be seen from the street. The words of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Janvrin,
the surgeon who was called to the scene, did not quite
bear out Mangan's statement. <q>The gas light,</q>
said he, <q>was at the window next the little room;
in the large room--that is, the side next Fifth Avenue.
I think the shutter was turned partially back so that
it cut off the glare through the place where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan
himself was lying; the burner was turned on about
one-third of the usual force of a gas jet. I think it
could not have been seen from the street.</q> A detective
named Farley also asserted that there was a light.
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Washington Nathan, however, declared that there
was no light when he listened at his father's door,
which was ajar. As there was no light he supposed
his father was asleep. He did not put his head into
the room, but remained in the hall.</p>

<p>The discrepancy between the evidence of Mangan
and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Janvrin as to the position of the gas light
is by itself of not much importance, but it goes to
strengthen the impression that Mangan was deficient in
the astuteness and accuracy of observation which
should distinguish an efficient police officer. His
evidence showed a dull brain and added to the general
muddle. Washington's assertion that there was <emph>no</emph>
light in his father's room when he looked through
the partly open door is a much more serious point.
If true, the explanation can only be that the intruder
<pb n="43"/>
lighted the gas when he entered and left it burning
when he quitted the room.</p>

<p>To continue Washington Nathan's evidence. He
went on to say that he awoke about five in the morning
and went downstairs. <q>Just before I reached the
second story,</q> said he, <q>I noticed the front door
open; when I entered my father's room I first saw
something lying on the floor out of place near the
library; immediately after I discovered my father
lying as has already been described, I went and
called my brother and we both went downstairs
crying <q>Murder!</q> and <q>Police</q> &#x2026; I think my
brother had the key of the safe.&#x2026; I locked the
safe and I took the key.&#x2026; I knew the safe did
not contain any valuables.</q></p>

<p>What the witness had to say concerning his father's
weak sight was not without significance. He did not
think it was possible for the old man to recognise
anyone without his glasses. If this were so, it might
be argued that he was not killed lest he should be
able to identify his assailant. If the gas were turned
down as asserted, and he was not wearing his glasses,
anyone to whom he was known would have taken
the chance of recognition. There would hardly be
ground for battering him to death. Stunning him to
permit of escape would have been amply sufficient.</p>

<p>Washington was closely questioned as to his monetary
relations with his father. He admitted borrowing
5,000 dollars which he had not paid back, but this,
he explained, he was not expected to do. Whenever
he asked his father for money it was always given
cheerfully. He never had any misunderstanding with
his father. When the latter had occasion to give
<pb n="44"/>
him advice as to his habits, his manner was always
gentle and kind. His father had supplied the capital
to set him up in business, and he had had other sums
from, time to time. These sums did not amount to
25,000 dollars. He had never been required to pay
back any of the loans, but he had given security for
them. He denied having spent 30,000 dollars upon
a lady. He had never spent 3,000 dollars in a year
in his life. On the whole it must be admitted that
Washington said nothing which incriminated him
or even led suspicion in his direction.</p>

<p>Frederick Nathan was very circumstantial as to
his movements on the fatal night previous to the
tragedy, but his evidence on these points has little
bearing on the case, and he may be taken at once to
what happened after he arrived home at a quarter-past
eleven. Said he: <q>I opened the door of our
house with my night key, and as the key was not in
the lock knew my brother was still out.&#x2026; My
father's door was open; he said, <q>Who is that?</q>
I said; <q>It is I, sir.</q> He said, <q>If you want any ice
water there is some on the mantelpiece.</q> I said I
had just had a drink; there was no light in the room;
it was perfectly dark; the door was open sufficiently
for me to go in a little to the side and stand at the
extreme end of the door and speak to my father. I
then immediately proceeded to my room and went
to bed. I did not hear my brother come in.</q></p>

<p>The next morning Frederick arose at about ten
minutes to five; he put on his pants, walked to the
window to see what kind of a day it was and went
into his brother's room. His; brother was <q>lying
down in his bed apparently asleep,</q> and he did not
<pb n="45"/>
wake him. Frederick Nathan then went into a room
adjoining his own, and coming out met his brother,
who said he was going downstairs and would awaken
their father. Washington accordingly went downstairs
and Frederick heard him yell. Frederick ran
down and saw his brother standing at the door. <q>I
rushed in,</q> said the witness, <q>and knelt down on the
right-hand side of my father to see if he was entirely
dead. I may also state that on reaching the landing
before the second story, I saw the hall street door
sufficiently open for a man to walk in sideways.</q></p>

<p>This matter of the open door is not to be dismissed
without comment. Frederick Nathan's statement
was corroborated by a newsboy, who at ten minutes
past five or so was folding his newspapers on the
steps of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan's house. He declared that the
door was then open for about two inches. He moved
his newspapers away, and after that he heard shouts
of <q>Murder!</q> The fact of the door being open
would suggest that the murderer had made his escape
that way after leaving the <q>dog</q> in the hall; but
was the door open? Police officer Mangan swore
that some four minutes before he heard the cry for
help he passed the house and examined the door.
It was closed. It is impossible to decide between
these contrary assertions. As we have had occasion
to point out, Mangan was very hazy in some portions
of his recollections, and it is quite possible that when
he passed the house, thinking all was well, he took
very little notice of the door. It is not likely he
would confess to any dereliction of duty.</p>

<p>Frederick Nathan's statement, save as to the open
door, did not add materially to the evidence given
<pb n="46"/>
by the other witnesses. It is, however, fair to state
that he further corroborated what his brother said
concerning the absence of any quarrels with his father.</p>

<p>Only the testimony of the two other persons--<abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Kelly, the housekeeper, and her son William--who
were in the house on the night of the murder remains
to be examined. The tenor of the questions put
to these two by the coroner and the district attorney
showed that the authorities regarded them as suspected
persons. The woman was subjected to a searching
enquiry which caused her to be not a little angry, and
with reason, as its irrelevance was patent. On any
circumstance relating to the murder she had nothing
whatever to say which helped the enquiry. She had
no knowledge of the <q>dog</q> and had never seen such
a thing on the premises. She admitted that she
knew <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Benjamin Nathan was coming that night
to sleep at the house and that she told her son so,
but this went for very little. She also said that she
had heard a slight noise about two o'clock in the
morning of the 29th, but paid no attention to it and
went to sleep again.</p>

<p>The examination of William Kelly was still more
searching, but nothing bearing on the murder was
elicited. The young man kept his head and was not
to be confused nor tripped into contradictions. His
past was severely investigated and he did not attempt
to evade the questions. It was made pretty clear
that he was not a particularly reputable person and
that he had some questionable associates. He
admitted that he had enlisted during the Civil War
under a false name, and since the disbanding of the
army had drawn service money. For four years he had
<pb n="47"/>
been residing in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan's house doing very little
work and practically living on his mother. He
cleaned the boots and went on errands, but <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Nathan paid him no wages. Like his mother, he
knew nothing about the <q>dog.</q> His account as to
how he spent his time during the night before the
murder was not very satisfactory, but he could not
be brought to say anything which in the slightest
degree incriminated him. He was taking boots to
the bedrooms on the morning of the 29th when he
first heard of the murder from <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Frederick Nathan,
who met him on the staircase, and he said nothing.
His examination lasted a considerable time but, as
will be seen, his evidence was as unimportant as that
of his mother.</p>

<p>It seems strange that so violent a murder involving
the fall of a body should not have made sufficient
noise to arouse some of the inmates. If the deed
was perpetrated before midnight, the storm which
was raging at the time might have accounted for
this, but there was no evidence to support this supposition.
On the other hand a <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Peckham, who lived
next door, asserted that somewhere about two o'clock
both he and his wife heard strange sounds, but no
noise like that of a body falling. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Peckham's
story was somewhat vague and threw no light upon
the mystery. Walling's theory was that young Kelly
admitted a confederate who committed the murder,
but the theory was without the least support. It
is somewhat curious, in view of the torrents of rain
which fell, that the stairs bore no traces of muddy
feet, but it would appear that the police never looked
for any. What was seen on the stairs were footprints
<pb n="48"/>
of blood. These footprints were all in one direction:
they descended to the door. It was asserted that
these marks of blood came from <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Frederick Nathan's
feet, which were bootless, and this assertion was
accepted by the coroner. Possibly this was so, as it
is not disputed that Frederick's nightshirt and pants
were considerably blood-stained from his having
knelt by his father's side. Washington's night clothes,
on the other hand, were quite free from any blood.</p>

<p>The inquest came to a somewhat abrupt conclusion.
After another doctor had discoursed at considerable
length on the nature of the wounds, chiefly in
corroboration of what his professional <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">confr&#xe8;res</foreign> had
already said, the coroner, without any attempt to
consolidate the story, declared that it was useless to
proceed further with the enquiry. He adjourned it
<foreign xml:lang="la">sine die</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="la">sine die</foreign> it has remained to the present
day.</p>

<p>Speculation is useless in the face of so much
discrepancy and contradiction and of so little success
in establishing essential points.</p>

<p>Few murder mysteries can be cited which exhibit
such a lack of detective instinct on the part of the
police as the Nathan tragedy. If they discerned a
clue anywhere, they failed to act upon it. They were
unable to trace a single stolen article. They were
baffled in their attempts--if they made any--to find
out the truth about William Kelly. The big reward
of 45,000 dollars offered for the discovery and capture
of the murderer did not stimulate them. They
allowed the blood-marked garments of Frederick
Nathan and the stained carpet in the room where
the murder was committed to be taken away--the
<pb n="49"/>
first to the laundry and the second to the cleaners--a
few hours after the tragedy, and offered no explanation
of their remissness. The extraordinary carelessness
and indifference they showed in allowing the scene
of the tragedy to be disturbed has already been
commented upon. In a word, the affair was allowed
to drift and they did not move a finger. To the very
last their object seems to have been to get rid of
everything connected with the case as soon as possible,
for even the <q>dog</q> which is in the Crime Museum--answering
to the one at Scotland Yard--is not the
identical <q>dog</q> which figured so largely at the
coroner's inquest, but a substitute!</p>

<p>Walling insinuates that Jourdan, the head of the
New York police at the time, knew something which
he dared not disclose, and alludes to his changed
manner after the tragedy and how he <q>pined away</q>
and died soon after, winding up with the question,
<q>Was he in possession of an awful secret?</q> With
this supposition the matter must rest.</p>

<p>Three years later a confession was made by a well-known
professional burglar, John T. Irving by name,
of his complicity in the murder. Irving's confession
was extremely circumstantial, but its value was
considerably discounted by the bargain he wanted to
make with the authorities that he would produce
the necessary corroborative evidence if they would
promise not to prosecute him for two burglaries he
had committed. Needless to say, this cool proposition
was rejected. The salient features of his <soCalled>confession,</soCalled>
whether true or false, make, however, instructive
reading. The plan of breaking into <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan's
house arose out of a chance meeting between Irving
<pb n="50"/>
and two of his pals, <choice><reg>McNally</reg><orig>M'Nally</orig></choice> Grunnion and a fellow
crook, Kelly. There was a good deal of talk, but
nothing was done for some weeks, when all four met
by appointment and Kelly instructed the others to
follow one after the other a short distance apart, and
to move up close together to the house by a signal
from the man at the gate wiping his face with a
handkerchief. The gang entered the house by the
basement door, Grunnion and Irving going to the
cellar to wait until Kelly, who had ascended the
staircase, should call them. After some little time
Kelly joined them, they took off their shoes and
went up three flights of stairs. They entered a room
and Irving noticed a person lying on the floor. In
the small room Irving stepped on a pocket book.
It contained bonds and stock certificates. The value
was about 6,000 dollars, and in addition they took
273 dollars in money. Kelly washed his hands in the
bathroom and Irving noticed fingermarks of blood
on the jamb of the door. They left the house about
half-past five in the morning.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the above which anyone could
not have made up from the newspaper reports, but
this did not satisfy Irving, who was good enough to
solve the mystery of the <q>dog.</q> After dividing
the spoil, Kelly suddenly exclaimed, <q>You know that
dog I got from Nick Jones? Well, I left it behind.</q>
The confession follows on with a tedious rigmarole
concerning Nick Jones, and winds up with a conversation
Irving had with Kelly about the murder. Kelly
said that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan's return was quite unexpected.
Kelly, however, entered his room while the old man
was asleep, got the key of the safe, and was opening
<pb n="51"/>
the safe when <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan woke and came towards
him. Kelly lifted the <q>dog,</q> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nathan flung up
his hands and received the blow on one of them.
Kelly, after striking Nathan several times on the
head, ran downstairs and, finding all was quiet, took
his confederates back to complete the job.</p>

<p>It will be seen that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> John T. Irving does not
tell us one single item with which we are not acquainted.
The <soCalled>confession</soCalled> may be dismissed as bogus.</p>

<p>It is pretty safe to assert that in the list of murder
mysteries women victims greatly outnumber
those of the sterner sex. Those unhappy creatures
who are driven to depend for their livelihood by
contributing to what is called the <q>social evil</q> give
ample opportunities to men with abnormal propensities
to satisfy their mad lust for blood. <q>Jack the
Ripper</q> stands at the head of these monsters. The
story of his atrocities is one of unmitigated horrors, and
does not find a place in these pages. Nor is it necessary
to go minutely into the details of the many other
sordid tragedies, the motives for which may be assigned
to depraved passions and diseased brains. Mystery,
it is true, is attached to each, but the surrounding
circumstances are very similar in every case and the
problem of one is the problem of all. These mysteries
belong to a class by themselves and need only be
dealt with cursorily.</p>

<pb n="54"/>
<p>The murder of Eliza Grimwood, an <soCalled>unfortunate</soCalled>
of the Waterloo Road, in the early forties may be taken
as a representative example. Her movements during
the early part of the summer night when she was
done to death were brought to light, but the rest is
darkness. She was a good-looking, buxom, fresh-coloured
young woman, frivolous like many of her
sisterhood, and, dressed in a fawn-coloured silk frock,
blue bonnet with gaudy flowers and feathers, and
with lavender kid gloves on her hands, she strolled
into the Strand Theatre at the half-price time. The
play was <title>Weller</title>, an adaptation of <q>Pickwick,</q> then
all the rage, and doubtless, together with the rest of
the audience, she laughed heartily at its drolleries.</p>

<p>A dark-featured, well-dressed man, with black bushy
whiskers and wearing a broad-brimmed tall hat, sat
by her side. They once adjourned to the refreshment
bar and returned to their seats. Soon after the play
was over a cabman <q>picked up</q> a lady and gentleman
in the Strand and put them down at the foot of Waterloo
Bridge on the Surrey side. The cabman subsequently
identified Eliza Grimwood as the woman,
and said that the man had dark bushy whiskers and
a broad-brimmed hat.</p>

<p>Here all trace of her alive is lost. The next time
she was seen she was lying dead in her room, beneath
a heap of tumbled bedclothes, her throat frightfully
gashed. There were signs of a slight struggle, but the
assassin had done his work so stealthily and noiselessly
that not a soul in the house heard anything;
even the dog in the house had not been aroused. Not
the vestige of a clue had he left behind, and it was
never known what was the weapon he had used.</p>

<pb n="55"/>
<p>All kinds of theories were started, one or two arrests
were made on suspicion, but the police found themselves
helpless, and the question, <q>Who killed Eliza
Grimwood?</q>--a newspaper headline which faced
the public day after day--has never found its answer.
A grim advertisement marks the closing scene and
also the morbid taste of the times. <q type="written">By order of
the administrators of the late Eliza Grimwood,</q> it
began, and went on to announce that the furniture
and effects belonging to the murdered woman at 12
Wellington Terrace, Waterloo Road, were to be sold
by auction. The <q>administrators,</q> whoever they
were, saw their way to make a pretty penny out of
the depraved curiosity of the public. The catalogues
were priced at threepence each, and no persons were
admitted unless they could produce one of these
vouchers.</p>

<p>Burton Crescent--that place of grim memories
now concealed under its transformation to Cartwright
Gardens--was the scene of two mystery tragedies,
one of which was closely allied to that of Eliza Grimwood.
It can be told in a few words. Annie Yeats,
a lonely orphan brought up in an industrial school,
had gone the too-frequent way of girls without friends,
resources and definite occupation. All that is known
of her fate is that one Saturday night she went out
with Annie Ellis, a girl friend living in the same house.
They met a man whom Annie Yeats appeared to know
and the two parted from Ellis, went off together and
were seen no more. About three o'clock on Sunday
morning the inmates of <abbr>No.</abbr> 12 Burton Crescent
heard a piercing shriek, but no one heeded. Annie
Yeats was subject to hysteria, and a scream from her
<pb n="56"/>
room was in no way unusual. Shortly there was
the sound of stealthy footsteps, but again no one
took any notice. In a tenement house full of lodgers
it is not etiquette for the occupant of one room to
bother about the doings of another. So, as the cry
was not repeated and as nothing else occurred, everybody
turned over and went to sleep. Annie Ellis
and Annie Yeats generally breakfasted together on
Sunday morning, and Yeats not making her appearance
Annie Ellis entered her room. The bed was empty,
and in one corner, as with Eliza Grimwood, the bed
clothes were huddled together, a foot with a boot on
protruding from the heap. Beneath the clothes
poor Annie Yeats was lying dead, strangled by a
towel tied tightly round her face over the mouth,
the knot at the back of her head. The pitiful story
ends here.</p>

<p>The case of Harriet Buswell is a parallel of those
of Eliza Grimwood and Annie Yeats. She was of
the same class and she was murdered by some unknown
man in her room in Great Coram Street, Bloomsbury.
So also was Emily Dimmock, who was done to death
in her room at Camden Town. In this instance,
however, a man against whom there was great suspicion
was arrested, but nothing conclusive was proved, and
after a long investigation he was released.</p>

<p>The most baffling mysteries are those where there
is no apparent motive for the crime. The murder
of Miss Camp in a railway carriage on the London
and South Western Railway near Wandsworth was
very puzzling, but the puzzle belonged to her assailant
and not to the crime, as will be seen when later on the
story is told. The death of Sophia Money in the
<pb n="57"/>
Merstham tunnel would have taken its place among
the motiveless crimes had it proved that the girl had
been murdered. But there was some doubt as to this.
The probabilities were equally in favour of an opening
of the carriage door, either accidentally or intentionally,
with the object, maybe, of escaping the unwelcome
attentions of some person in the same compartment.
The problem, at any rate, was never solved.</p>

<p>Of apparently motiveless murders three cases of
young women victims, all unmarried, deserve careful
attention, namely Kate Dungay in Henley Wood,
Jane Roberts at Manchester, and Marie Clousen at
Eltham. Quite as absorbing and as motiveless are
the murders of three married women--Sarah Millson in
Cannon Street, London; <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Noel at Ramsgate;
and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville at Slough.<note place="bottom">The details of this strange tragedy are dealt with under the heading
<q>Shop Murders.</q></note> Other mysterious
woman murders there are, the perpetrators of which
could never be traced, but in these the motives were
fairly apparent, and such cases do not fall within the
present consideration.</p>

<div n="4.1" type="section">
<pb n="58"/>
<head>Kate Dungay</head>
<head>The Dark Drama of Henley Wood</head>

<p>The tragedy which had Kate Dungay as its central
figure did not at the time attract the attention
it deserved. Not only was it--like so many unsolved
mysteries--a case of police ineptitude, but there were
curious and unexplained side issues which, if persistently
followed up, might have thrown light upon
an enigma which, as it stands, baffles solution.</p>

<p>It was a wild stormy December day. Fierce showers
beat against the windows of Lambridge House, a
lonely dwelling not far from Henley-on-Thames, and
now and again from the adjacent wood came the
dismal soughing of the wind through the leafless
trees.</p>

<p>About half-past four in the afternoon George
Dawson, who looked after the farm work, left the
house to go home, but before doing so he entered
the sitting room to enquire if Miss Dungay, the housekeeper,
had any instructions for him. He found
her engaged in knitting. She spoke to him in her
customary reserved manner; he bade her good-night,
and departed.</p>

<p>Lambridge House belonged to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mash, a fruiterer
in business in Glasshouse Street, Regent Street. He
<pb n="59"/>
had also a house at Henley, and Kate Dungay had
been in his employ at Lambridge House for a considerable
time, first as governess and afterwards as housekeeper.
Practically she was the only occupant, save
at night, when two boys named Froomes, the sons
of a neighbour, came in to sleep.</p>

<p>It does not appear that Miss Dungay was at all
influenced either by the lonely situation of the house
or by her own solitude. She had never expressed
any fear--indeed it was said that she preferred the
quiet farm house by the wood to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mash's residence
at Henley. Maybe she regarded the two dogs, which
(when the boys were not with her) were her companions,
as sufficient protection. Of these dogs, one
kept in the house was a spaniel, old and almost blind,
and the other, a retriever, was generally on the chain
outside. It is to be noted, however, that about
a fortnight before the tragedy she told Dawson that
she felt nervous, but she did not say why.</p>

<p>It was dark as pitch and raining heavily when about
eight o'clock the boys arrived as usual and knocked
at the door. There was no answer, and thinking
Miss Dungay was out, they went to the rear of the
premises and crept into the well-house for shelter
to wait until she returned. They felt very uneasy,
for it was strange that Miss Dungay should be out,
and on such a night. What added to their vague
fears was a weird melancholy sound they had heard
as they were nearing the house. This sound, said
one of them, was <q>like the growling of a cat over a
mouse.</q></p>

<p>The lads waited until they were tired and then
stole out and looked through the glass of the kitchen
<pb n="60"/>
door. A lamp was burning on the table and they
could see the clock. It was ten minutes to ten and,
greatly alarmed at the strange absence of the housekeeper,
they ran home and told their father. <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Froomes acted at once. He and his sons set out for
George Dawson's cottage, and the man, who was in
bed, got up and the four went off to Lambridge House.</p>

<p>Dawson's knocking was futile, and he and the others
went to the back of the house. The retriever was
on the chain and in its kennel.</p>

<p><q>It seemed to be drowsy,</q> said Dawson in his
evidence.</p>

<p>The kitchen door was locked from the inside and
all the windows were fastened excepting the bay
window of the sitting room. The bottom sash was
thrown up and the party entered the house through
the open window.</p>

<p>They could see nothing unusual. The chair in
which Miss Dungay was sitting when Dawson last
saw her was unmoved. Her knitting, a handkerchief
and a book were on the table, and the lamp was
burning. The table was set for tea and on the tray
were one plate, <emph>two</emph> cups, and one saucer.</p>

<p>They went upstairs to the bedroom, but could not
find that anything had been disturbed. They then
examined the dairy and cellar, but all was in order.
Dawson fetched a lantern from the well-house, and on
the wall of the passage leading to the front door and
on the handle of the door he saw bloodstains. The
door, he told the coroner, was <emph>bolted at the top</emph>. The
key was in the lock but had not been turned. In
the porch he found a thick stick broken, with marks
of blood upon it.</p>

<pb n="61"/>
<p>The boys, remembering the singular noise they
had heard, took Dawson and their father in the direction
from which it had apparently come, and two
yards or so from the wood and about thirty yards
from the house the poor young woman was discovered
lying straight on her back. By her side was a rammer
used for smashing up potatoes for the pigs. It was
a formidable weapon some four feet long, one end
very thick and massive.</p>

<p>Dawson never looked to see if she was dead. He
was <q>too terrified,</q> he said. Shutting up the house,
he drove to Henley police station, which he entered
in a state of nervous terror.</p>

<p><q>The housekeeper at Lambridge House has been
murdered to-night,</q> he gasped.</p>

<p>Inspector Keal set out at once to the scene of the
murder. A more unfavourable night for an outdoor
investigation could hardly be imagined. It was
hailing and raining in torrents. Had there been
footprints the rain must have long since washed
them away. Apart from this it was too dark to make
anything like a minute examination of the ground.
All that the inspector could see was the rammer, which
he said was so close to the body that Miss Dungay's
hair covered it at one end, and there was blood upon
it.</p>

<p>The inspector and Dawson carried the body into the
house, and the former, searching the rooms, confirmed
Dawson's statement that nothing had been disturbed.
On examining the passage he found Miss Dungay's
brooch, some hairpins, and a broken night-light glass.
There were scratches on the ceiling which he thought
had been made by the jagged end of a stick. The
<pb n="62"/>
inspector does not seem to have noticed the teacups
nor a handbag, nor two unopened letters on the table.
At any rate, he did not mention them in his evidence.</p>

<p>On the following morning the inspector searched
the ground where the body had been lying and found
another portion of the stick which Dawson had
picked up in the porch, and a poker. He also discovered
a footprint on the flower bed near the bay
window.</p>

<p>Inspector Keal appears to have placed an amazing
trust in Dawson. It would seem also that he had
very hazy ideas of investigating a mysterious murder.
It is true he locked the body in a room, the key of which
he kept, but the house itself he left in Dawson's charge
and he allowed the key to be in the man's possession
a whole week. He did not take care that nothing
should be disturbed in the room where Miss Dungay
had been sitting, and no wonder the chairman of the
bench of magistrates expressed his inability to understand
such laxity.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mash, his wife, and Miss Julia Dungay, the
sister of the murdered woman, came down the following
day and went through the house. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mash could
find no traces of robbery. On the table he saw the
two unopened letters which the inspector apparently
overlooked, and these Miss Julia Dungay took away.
Miss Julia Dungay also possessed herself of her sister's
handbag.</p>

<p><q>I read part of one of them,</q> said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mash, but
what it was he read he did not say.</p>

<p>These two letters may not have had any bearing
on the mystery, but it is extraordinary that they
should have been left by the police for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mash to
<pb n="63"/>
find. It may also be remarked as singular that in
the report of the inquest there is no mention by <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Mash of the discovery of the letters, and but for the
fact that subsequently a man was apprehended and
brought before the magistrates, when <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mash gave
evidence, and <emph>then</emph> mentioned the letters, nothing
would have been known about them being found.
It is singular also that the magistrates should not
have asked what these epistles contained.</p>

<p>The reporter of the <title>Henley Advertiser</title>, whose business
it was to pick up what he could concerning the murder,
writing before the inquest, said:</p>

<p><q type="written">Four or five sovereigns were found in a handbag.
The lady's pocket had been rifled, and this it is suggested
would go to show that the murderer wanted something
which Miss Dungay possessed, and that after a struggle
he killed her.</q></p>

<p>Whether this statement as to the money or the
rifling of the pocket was correct we have no means
of knowing. The matter was not alluded to, as it
should have been, either at the inquest or the police
court. If it were true, where did the reporter get
his information? Was it given him by Dawson,
by Inspector Keal, or by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mash? So far as the
public investigation went we are left in doubt as to
the contents (if any) of the bag, and the responsibility
of this omission rests on the police.</p>

<p>Another singular point hinges upon the reporter's
statement that Miss Dungay's pocket was rifled by
the murderer, who wanted her to give up something
in her possession. There is not a word in Inspector
Keal's evidence (as reported) to show that he searched
the deceased. Why did he not do so? One would
<pb n="64"/>
have thought that this would have been the first
thing to occur to him after the removal of the body
to the house. One would like to know also how the
reporter formulated his theory? Did he evolve it
himself, or was he assisted by anybody? There are
no answers to these questions.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mash did not, or could not, throw any light
upon the mystery. All he said was that Miss Dungay
must have had money in the house; but if so, what
became of it? He added that she was not engaged
to anyone, nor were strangers (strangers to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mash,
it may be presumed) in the habit of visiting her.
He remarked that <q>she was too happy to have any
mental trouble.</q></p>

<p>The evidence of the surgeon, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> George Smith,
showed that the assault was of a most determined
and brutal character. There were no less than
twenty-four wounds, some inflicted by a blunt weapon,
and others by a cutting instrument; the most serious
injury, the one causing death, being a deep cut on
the neck severing the jugular vein and reaching down
to the backbone.</p>

<p>The importance of this wound lies in the fact that
the blood must have spurted out, said the surgeon,
some two or three feet; that the murderer must have
been close to his victim when he stabbed or hacked
her (the surgeon could not say it was done by a single
stab) and that blood must have gone on his clothes.</p>

<p>It was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Smith's opinion that the poor woman
might have lingered quite two hours, and this opinion
was borne out by the fact that a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Liliwhite, a
pheasant farmer living a little distance from Lambridge
House, heard a <q>long scream</q> at about a
<pb n="65"/>
quarter-past six. If this was her last effort before
the final and fatal blow was given, she lasted until
eight o'clock, when the boys heard the weird growling
sound.</p>

<p>The coroner's jury returned a verdict of wilful
murder against some person or persons unknown.
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mash offered a reward of £100 for the discovery
of the murderer, and the police set to work. They
had their eye on a man named Rathall who had
been employed on and off at Lambridge House, and
they had no difficulty in running him to earth. He
was arrested at Daventry.</p>

<p>The evidence against Rathall was of the most flimsy
character. The only point of implication was a
surmise by Inspector Keal that the footprints on the
circular flower bed in front of the sitting-room window
bore some sort of resemblance to the boots Rathall
was wearing. As the rain must have altered the
shape of the marks, and as Rathall had been wearing
the boots for quite a month after the murder, the
surmise was worthless. Apart from this there was
nothing to connect Rathall with the crime; nothing
to suggest a hypothesis that he <emph>might</emph> have committed
the murder.</p>

<p>He was a needy man with a wife and family living
in a common lodging house, and supposing he was
the murderer, his only motive would have been
robbery; but, according to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mash, nothing had
been taken, so that any supposition of this kind falls
to the ground.</p>

<p>The evidence of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ayers, the lodging house
keeper, was sufficient to prove an alibi. The man
(a connection of Rathall's by marriage) who gave
<pb n="66"/>
information to the police admitted that he expected
the £100 reward. Most important of all was the
fact that there was not a spot of blood on Rathall's
clothes--an impossibility, in face of the surgeon's
statement as to the spurting of blood, had Rathall
been the man who so brutally attacked Miss Dungay.</p>

<p>Remembering all this, it was only reasonable that
the magistrates should declare that there was no
evidence against the man, and he was accordingly
discharged. Clearly the police had committed another
blunder and had wasted time in following up what
was obviously from the first a false clue.</p>

<p>In whatever way one may review the points in this
bewildering case, puzzles present themselves at every
turn. Certain things, however, suggest that the
murderer deliberately laid his plans. The stick, one
portion of which was found in the porch and the other
near the body, had been partly cut and partly broken
from a stake under a hay rick. How near this hay
rick was to the house does not appear. The detective
who found it was not asked the question, but it may
be assumed that it was not far. Possibly the miscreant
did not anticipate using his knife, and as a sort of
afterthought provided himself at the last moment
with the stick, and must have had it with him when
he entered the house.</p>

<p>His possession of the rammer is not so easily accounted
for. It is hardly to be supposed that he took
this clumsy weapon with him also. But at what
stage of the tragedy did he become possessed of it?
How did he know that such a thing was in the copper
in the well-house? Was it by accident that he found
it, or was he acquainted with the premises and knew
<pb n="67"/>
where it was kept? However this might be, it does
not answer the question why it should be near the
body.</p>

<p>It is by no means certain that injuries were inflicted
with the rammer. It was four feet long, but we are
not told its thickness--one of the many omissions
with which the official examination bristles. If it
were used, one would imagine that a blow from it
would have resulted in something more than a surface
injury. The doctor does not appear to have discovered
broken bones or a fractured skull. He speaks only
of cuts; and injuries caused by a blunt weapon.
One expression he employed is curious. <q>The murder,</q>
he said, <q>need not have been committed by a
strong person.</q> What led him to this opinion he did
not explain. Hence the puzzle of the use of the
rammer becomes more profound.</p>

<p>The <soCalled>reconstruction</soCalled> of the crime would defy
the ingenuity of an Edgar Allan Poe. The undisturbed
state of the sitting room is a convincing proof
that the struggle did not commence there. The <emph>two</emph>
teacups would suggest that Miss Dungay was acquainted
with the stranger, and could it have been
said that <emph>both</emph> cups were used, this point would have
settled much. But it was overlooked. Dawson was
asked if he had noticed whether two chairs had been
used. He said he had not.</p>

<p>There was undoubtedly a struggle in the passage.
But what led up to it? Did the assassin enter the
sitting room and confront his victim, and did she
follow him into the passage, or was he lying in wait
for her as she passed into the kitchen? No one can
say.</p>

<pb n="68"/>
<p>How did the miscreant enter the house and how
did he leave it? Dawson's story was that the bay
window was unlatched and the doors fastened, the
front door being bolted at the top. The supposition
of the police was that Miss Dungay had run out by
the front door and that the murderer had pursued
her by jumping out of the window. Why he also
should not have gone out by the door the police did
not explain, nor did they attempt to reconcile their
version with the puzzle of the bolted front door.
Nor had they anything to say as to how he entered
the house.</p>

<p>The theory of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Woods, who defended Rathall,
was more feasible. He thought that the fellow
entered by the kitchen door (this of course presupposes
that the door had been left unfastened), locked it
after him, and then bolted the front door. If this
were so, his purpose was to imprison the woman so
that he could compel her to give up whatever it was
that he wanted. Then came the struggle, and she
must have sought escape by the window and he
followed. The tragedy of the wood completed the story.</p>

<p>Allowing this to have been something like what
occurred, several questions remain unanswered. What
about the rammer? Was the murderer holding it
when he jumped out of the window? What of the
poker? Was it snatched up by Miss Dungay to
defend herself with? From what apartment did it
come--the kitchen or the sitting room? When and
how were the two unopened letters delivered?
Through the post or by hand? Who were the writers?
None of these questions seem to have troubled the
authorities.</p>

<pb n="69"/>
<p>The unravelling of the tangled threads of this most
singular case would have delighted the born detective.
But Henley-on-Thames does not appear to have
possessed one.</p>

<head>Jane Roberts of Manchester</head>
<head type="sub">The Mystery of a Decoy Letter</head>

<p>The time of the year was January; the hour a
little before midday; the place one of two
semi-detached houses in Westbourne Grove, Harpurhey,
a suburb to the north-east of Manchester. The
household consisted of a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood, an old man
past seventy, his invalid wife, and their servant,
Jane Roberts, a buxom, fresh-coloured girl of nineteen.</p>

<p>A <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooper, with whom <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood had business
relations, had occasion to call at the hour named
above, and the door was opened by Jane Roberts,
the servant maid. A letter was lying on the floor,
and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooper, catching sight of it, said to the girl,
jokingly:</p>

<p><q>Hallo, Jane, here's a love-letter for you.</q></p>

<p>The girl laughed, and picking up the letter, looked
at it and said:</p>

<p><q>It's for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood.</q></p>

<p>This letter had not been delivered by the postman,
but had been pushed through the letter slit or slipped
under the door. There is no evidence to show that
the messenger knocked or rang when he delivered it.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooper proceeded upstairs and saw <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood,
<pb n="71"/>
to whom the letter was subsequently given
by Jane Roberts. The epistle ran as follows:</p>

<q type="letter">
<p rend="letdate"><q rend="I">January 7th, '79.</q></p>

<p><q rend="I"><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood, I want to take that land near the
coal yard behind the druggist's shop, Queen's Road.
I will pay either monthly, quarterly, or yearly, and
will pay in advance, and I will meet you to-night
from five to six o'clock at the Three Tuns, corner
of Churnet Street, and will tell you all particulars.
I don't know your address or would have posted it.</q></p>

<p><q rend="I">Yours, etc.,</q></p>

<p><q>W. Wilson.</q></p>

<p>Oldham Road.</p>
</q>

<p>The letter was addressed simply, <q><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood,</q>
and it may be remarked that the writer made a mistake
in the year, which should have been 1880. <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Greenwood did not recognise the writing, which was
very precise and clear, as though great pains had
been taken with it; nor did he know anyone named
<q>W. Wilson.</q></p>

<p>The offer seemed a desirable one, but somehow it
did not strike <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood as altogether genuine.</p>

<p><q>It's no use my going to see this man,</q> said he to
his wife, a little after five, when he had had his tea.
<q>I'd rather not go.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh,</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenwood, <q>I would just go
round and see. It will be only a short walk.</q></p>

<p>Reluctantly the old man kept the appointment
at the Three Tuns, and asked the waiter if there had
been anyone enquiring for Greenwood.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> was the reply.</p>


<pb n="72"/>

<p><q>Do you know <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilson?</q></p>

<p>Again the answer was in the negative.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood then walked about outside the inn
for a quarter of an hour, and going back enquired if
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilson had come. The waiter told him he had
seen no one.</p>

<p><q>Then,</q> said the old man, a little annoyed, <q>if
anybody comes here to ask if Greenwood has been
here you can tell them I've gone away, and if they
want me they will have to come to Westbourne
Grove.</q></p>

<p>It was then within a few minutes of seven o'clock.</p>

<p>While <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood was away something mysterious
had happened in his house. The hand of death
had descended swiftly and without warning upon one
of the occupants, and upon the tragedy had fallen
a veil which to this day has never been lifted.</p>

<p>Up to half-past six everything had proceeded in its
customary, uneventful, placid way. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood's
was a well-ordered household, and rarely did anything
go awry. At half-past six the milkman called, and
Jane Roberts, smiling as usual, took in the milk.
A few minutes afterwards <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenwood, who had
not long got out of bed, heard a knock at the front
door. She heard Jane open the door, close it, and then
followed the sound of soft, creeping footsteps. The
old lady could not decide whether those stealthy
footsteps were those of one or two persons. She was
rather inclined to think there were two, but she
then attached no importance to the circumstance.</p>

<p>The footsteps went through the lobby, then <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Greenwood heard the kitchen door shut softly, and
after this all was still.</p>

<pb n="73"/>

<p>Five or six minutes went over. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenwood
had forgotten about Jane Roberts, when suddenly
the silence was broken by a piercing scream. That
scream came from the direction of the kitchen. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Greenwood had not long recovered from an illness,
and the cry sent her vibrating with terror. However,
she mustered up sufficient courage to creep to the
landing. Leaning over the stair-rail she called out:</p>

<p><q>Jane, what's the matter?</q></p>

<p>There was no reply, but the next instant came
another scream, less loud, less piercing, less poignant,
than the first. The poor old lady was overcome by
this second cry. She stood for a few minutes trembling,
and then slowly descended the stairs to the lobby.
She was afraid to enter the kitchen, so creeping to
the front door, she opened it and screamed <q>Murder!</q></p>

<p>In the meantime, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cadman, who lived next
door, had also heard the piercing cry from the Greenwood's
kitchen, and at first thought that something
had happened to her own daughter. She soon found
this was not the case, and then she was alarmed a
second time by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenwood's scream and ran
to her.</p>

<p>The two frightened women compared notes and,
emboldened by each other's presence, went into the
kitchen, and there they found Jane Roberts lying
face downwards on the floor, her head terribly bruised
and battered. The poor girl was alive but unconscious,
and she died before the doctor arrived, taking her
secret with her.</p>

<p>The murder and the circumstances attending it
presented one of those puzzles which baffle even
<pb n="74"/>
speculation for its solution. There was not a sign
of a struggle. The assassin had not left behind him
the slightest clue. Conjecture could not supply the
weapon with which he had done the poor girl to death.
Motive was entirely wanting. No one could say,
even, how he had escaped.</p>

<p>This last point was an important one to decide.
As <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenwood had not heard the front door
open, it was reasonable to suppose he had escaped by
the back. But whether he ran from one exit or the
other, the situation of the house assisted him. Westbourne
Grove in those days was only partly built
upon, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood's house was at the extreme
end farthest from the high road. There was a quantity
of vacant ground, and in the darkness anyone could
easily get away unobserved.</p>

<p>The medical examination showed that the girl had
been savagely attacked, and that before the murderer
judged he had completed his work some little time
must have elapsed. Expert opinion gave it that she
was felled by a blow which caused a terrible wound
over the right eye, and that while lying unconscious
the miscreant beat her about as she was lying on the
floor. She had hardly time to struggle. She uttered
her two despairing screams, and so far as resistance
was concerned, all was over.</p>

<p>But the blows of her assailant--how came they not
to be heard? This is one of the riddles connected
with the case, for it was said that the walls between
the Greenwood's kitchen and that of the Cadman's
was so thin that the sound of voices in one could be
heard in the other. The murder, save for the screams
of the victim, was a silent one.</p>

<pb n="75"/>

<p>What was the motive? If that could be settled
the murderer might be traced, but there was nothing
definite for one's guidance. The probabilities against
robbery were strong. Jane Roberts was a well-conducted
girl and not likely to have acquaintances who
were thieves, for one of the points beyond dispute is
that she knew the individual whom she admitted.
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood was not in the habit of keeping large
sums of money in the house, and at the time of the
tragedy there was not more than eight to ten pounds
on the premises. Nothing was taken, and it is hardly
likely that a thief capable of such violence would
proceed to attempt a robbery without being sure of
his plunder.</p>

<p>All that was really definite was the curious letter
which drew <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood from home. Was it not
a lure to get him out of the way? If so, who was the
writer? Obviously this was a clue which the police
were bound to follow as closely as possible.</p>

<p>As to the letter, several questions suggest themselves.
Was <q>W. Wilson</q> known to Jane Roberts?
There was no evidence that he was. Yet supposing
the reverse was the case, he might have written in
a feigned hand to deceive her.</p>

<p>Jane was a Welsh girl, and had been with the Greenwoods
some ten months. She was much liked by her
master and mistress, and she had the reputation of
being steady and industrious, while nothing was
known about any <q>followers.</q> But she might have
had a sweetheart and nobody be the wiser, especially
if it be true that she was <q>close,</q> as according to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Greenwood, she was inclined to be. She used to have
a good many letters, but when her box was searched,
<pb n="76"/>
all the correspondence found was with relatives.
In no case did the writing resemble that of <q>W.
Wilson.</q></p>

<p>Naturally it was of great importance to find out
all that was possible concerning Jane Roberts and her
doings. Here the police drew a blank. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Williams,
a reliable man, who knew her before she went to the
Greenwoods, and whose wife, indeed, recommended
her to them, was emphatic in regard to her having
no love affair of any kind.</p>

<p><q>During the whole of my acquaintance with her
I never knew her to be accompanied by anyone, or
to allude in the slightest and most casual manner to
a sweetheart, although in all matters, as far as I
believe, she admitted us to her full and unrestrained
confidence. I am convinced that the lover theory
is utterly baseless. The girl was, if not intensely
spiritual, at least conscientiously religious; she was
incapable of harming anyone, her demeanour was
quiet, modest, irreproachable.</q> And she may have
been all that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Williams thought she was, and yet
confide to him nothing about her love affair. Why
should she?</p>

<p>It will not fail to be noted that the murder was a
matter of a few minutes. In this connection, what
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenwood told the coroner is of importance.</p>

<p>In consequence of her illness <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenwood did
not get up until the evening, and Jane assisted her
to rise about ten minutes to six, the girl remaining
in the bedroom some ten minutes. Then, remarking
that she would wash the tea things, Jane went downstairs.
This would go to show that Jane did not
expect a visitor, or if she did, the washing of the tea
<pb n="77"/>
things was but an excuse to get away, so as to be in
readiness to open the door without attracting <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Greenwood's attention.</p>

<p>From five to ten minutes elapsed before <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenwood
heard the knock, the door open and close, the
soft footsteps, and the shutting of the kitchen door.
Five or six minutes of silence followed; then came
the first scream, and the old lady had just time to get
on to the landing when the second scream was heard.
Allowing for the preliminary talk between the girl
and her assassin, the actual murder could not have
taken more than a few seconds. The murderer no
doubt escaped while <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenwood was shrieking
on the front doorstep.</p>

<p>The coroner had nothing before him to throw light
upon the mystery. The milkman, who seems to have
been the last person besides <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenwood who
saw the girl just before the murder, could only say
that Jane said <q>good night</q> to him in her ordinary
manner, and that he saw no one in the road. The
police had found out nothing concerning the decoy
letter, and the inquest was not prolonged beyond
two days. The jury returned a verdict of wilful
murder against some person or persons unknown,
and the police were left to deal with the affair.</p>

<p>A reward was offered for information which would
lead to the capture of the murderer; the letter was
lithographed and copies circulated, and a lantern
slide was even made of it and exhibited in the public
streets. But no results followed, and finally it was
suggested that the dead girl's eyes should be photographed,
as it was possible the retina might have
retained an image of the assassin. This latter suggestion,
<pb n="78"/>
however, was regarded as preposterous by the
scientific experts, and no more was heard of it.</p>

<p>Two or three days after the inquest had closed
came the news that an arrest had been made at Plymouth,
and at first it looked as if the police were on
the right line, for the man, James Heald by name,
had lived at Harpurhey, and it was stated that his
arrest was through a resemblance between his writing
and that of <q>W. Wilson.</q></p>

<p>It turned out that Heald was <q>wanted</q> on a charge
of perjury, and this was the offence brought against
him when he was taken into custody. As a matter
of fact, the police did not care whether he had or had
not perjured himself. All they wanted was to keep
him in their hands while they tried to discover if he
had had anything to do with the Harpurhey mystery.</p>

<p>Before long the whole thing crumbled into dust.
The authorities had to confess that they were on a
false trail, and Heald was discharged, after having
been brought to Manchester and hauled several times
before the magistrates.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was great public dissatisfaction.
The police were found fault with for having wasted
time over an abortive arrest, and it was held that the
inquest ought not to have been closed summarily.
Various theories were advanced to picture what happened,
and, among others, it was suggested that in
spite of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cadman hearing nothing but two screams,
there might after all have been a struggle, as the
Greenwood's kitchen was covered with coconut
matting, which would have deadened any noise.
Moreover, the girl's hair, which was described as
<q>beautifully dressed</q> only a few minutes before
<pb n="79"/>
the crime, when she waited on her mistress, was
dishevelled, and her collar was found beneath the
kitchen dresser.</p>

<p>None of these statements was, however, made at
the inquest, and their absence supports the charge
that the duties of the coroner were performed somewhat
perfunctorily.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that all the theories should go back
to the starting-point--the decoy letter. One of the
questions which had not been answered was: <q>Who
placed it where it was found by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooper?</q> One
ingenious theorist suggested that it might have been
the girl herself. Might it not, he asked, account for
her affecting not to have seen it until <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooper
pointed it out to her? Was there not ground for the
suggestion that possibly Jane herself--all unwittingly
conniving at her own death--had agreed to receive
a visitor clandestinely, and that in order to insure
an undisturbed visitation (<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenwood being ill
upstairs) she was a party to the letter being written,
and that she placed it behind the front door herself,
possibly at the time when she heard <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooper knock?</p>

<p>There is one objection to this part of the theorist's
argument. It assumes that Jane knew <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooper
was coming. We are on firmer ground when it was
asserted that the visitor not only knew something of
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood's business and domestic life, but
also of his premises. He also knew that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greenwood
owned a plot of land off the Queen's Road, and
that there was a coal yard close to it. But we are
hardly prepared to admit in regard to the miscreant's
escape that, as one theorist suggested, <q>it was carefully
considered beforehand.</q></p>

<pb n="80"/>
<p>The <q>reconstruction</q> of the crime adopted by the
same speculator is as good probably as any other.
He held that there was conversation between the two,
and that the visitor laid some proposition before the
girl which did not meet with her approval. That
the man intended murder was apparent from the
number of serious wounds inflicted. Any one of
these injuries would have sufficed if he merely desired
to prevent her interfering with his escape, but he
wanted to make himself safe, and so silenced his
victim.</p>

<div n="4.3" xml:id="clousen" type="section">

<head type="main">Jane Maria Clousen</head>
<head type="sub">The Eltham Tragedy</head>

<p>The police have made many mistakes arising
out of their habit of propounding a theory and
twisting facts to support it, but never did they make
such a blunder as in what is known as the Eltham
Tragedy.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock on the night of April 25th, 1871,
Policeman Gunn, of the E Division, went on duty in
Kidbrooke Lane, leading to Eltham. He saw nothing
unusual, and he tramped the length of his beat, which
was a long one, returning to Kidbrooke Lane about
a quarter to two on the following morning. Again
all seemed well. A third time he passed through the
lane and noticed nothing. But on returning he found
a woman sitting on the right-hand side of the lane
(some twenty feet broad), half insensible.</p>

<p>The poor thing was moaning piteously, and exclaiming,
<q>Oh, my poor head!</q></p>

<p><q>What's the matter?</q> asked Gunn, turning his
bull's-eye upon her. She made no answer, and then
he saw that her right cheek was covered with blood.</p>

<p><q>Pull yourself together!</q> said the constable,
seizing her by the shoulder and giving her a slight
<pb n="82"/>
shake, according to the regulation mode of bringing
a person to his or her senses. <q>How did you come
by this?</q></p>

<p>She raised her left hand and asked the policeman
to take hold of it, turning at the same time her head,
which enabled him to see the other side of her face.
It was terribly battered.</p>

<p>Gunn now became alarmed, and asked what he
could do.</p>

<p><q>Let me die!</q> said the poor creature. She fell
forward on her face and never spoke again.</p>

<p>She was eventually removed to Guy's Hospital,
where she died within a few hours without regaining
consciousness. The wounds upon her head were of
the most terrible description, and evidently inflicted
by some blunt instrument. On the arms were some
clean cuts.</p>

<p>Not far from the spot was found a bloodstained
hammer, and this, it was pretty evident, was the
weapon with which the murder was committed.</p>

<p>The action of the police was from the first most
extraordinary. There were plenty of footsteps round
the spot where the woman was found, but it never
occurred to the detective to preserve an impression
of them, or even to measure them. Bloodstained
stones were noticed, but it was not thought necessary
to trouble about them. Indeed, the police examination
of the place where the murder was committed
was of the most casual character, and beyond saying
that there was a little blood, not one of the police
witnesses could say definitely whether there were
signs or not of a violent struggle.</p>

<p>The motive of the murder was, however, not robbery,
<pb n="83"/>
for a purse containing fourteen shillings was found
in the pocket, together with a locket.</p>

<p>She was but seventeen, and a pretty girl, and these
two facts excited the interest and the sympathy of
the public. Naturally, there was an outcry for the
police to exert themselves and discover the murderer.</p>

<p>And discover him they made certain they had.
So certain that, having made up their mind that a
young man named Edmund Walter Pook was the
murderer, they did not trouble to seek any further.</p>

<p>It was soon established who was the murdered
girl. Her name was Jane Maria Clousen, and she
had been in the service of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pook's father. Edmund
Walter Pook had, like hundreds of other young men
of his age, a tendency towards flirtation. It was a
harmless weakness, but in the hands of the police
it became the foundation stone of the charge which,
with much labour and a minimum of conscience, they
bolstered up.</p>

<p>Inspector Mulvaney, accompanied by Superintendent
Griffin, paid a visit to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pook's house in Greenwich,
and their own evidence makes it pretty plain
that if they left undone a good many things which
might have assisted them in the discovery of the
real murderer, they did much they ought not to
have done in trying to fix the guilt on Edmund
Walter Pook.</p>

<p><q>Haven't you written a letter to Jane Maria
Clousen?</q> asked Mulvaney insinuatingly to Pook.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> said the latter emphatically; <q>I've never
had anything to do with the girl.</q></p>

<p>Mulvaney's question was simply a chance shot,
but it failed.</p>

<pb n="84"/>

<p><q>Well, people say you have. What about that
locket you gave her?</q></p>

<p><q>I never gave her any locket. I don't know what
you're talking about!</q></p>

<p>Mulvaney then went on another tack.</p>

<p><q>Where is the shirt you were wearing on the night
of the 25th?</q> (It was now the 1st of May, a week
afterwards.)</p>

<p><q>I believe it's gone to the wash; but I'll go and
see.</q></p>

<p>He went away and returned, bringing with him a
shirt, on the right wristband of which were marks of
blood. Mulvaney pointed this out, whereupon Pook
said it most likely had come from scratches on his
arm.</p>

<p><q>Oh,</q> said Mulvaney, delighted at having found
out at last something suspicious, <q>but the scratches
are on your <emph>left</emph> arm, and the marks are on your right
wrist.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, I can't account for the marks in any other
way. The blood may have dropped from one arm
to the other when I was washing my hands.</q></p>

<p><q>What were you doing on the 24th April?</q> (This
was the night before the murder.)</p>

<p><q>I was about the town here. My brother will
tell you the same thing.</q></p>

<p>The suit of clothes he wore on the night of the
murder was then produced. The coat and trousers
were <emph>dark</emph>, and the hat was a soft felt one.</p>

<p>The two officers looked at the clothes very eagerly;
but there was nothing very suspicious about them.</p>

<p><q>I should have expected to find the hat more
crumpled, and with blood on it,</q> admitted Superintendent
Griffin
<pb n="85"/>
subsequently, though he didn't say
so at the time.</p>

<p>Anyhow, they took the clothes away and took
Walter Pook into custody.</p>

<p><q>Very well,</q> said he, when told he must go to the
station. <q>I will go with you anywhere.</q></p>

<p>Pook certainly did not behave like a guilty man.
He showed neither callous indifference nor fear--the
two characteristics of most murderers. He simply
exhibited common sense. Asking for pen and ink
and paper when he reached the police station, he
wrote a letter to a Miss Dwinford, with whom he was
keeping company, informing her that he had been
taken into custody for the murder of <q>that Eltham
girl,</q> but that the charge was <q>almost too ridiculous
to mention.</q> On that account he could not keep
an appointment he had made with Miss Dwinford,
but hoped to be out by Tuesday to do so.</p>

<p>It did not occur to him that the police were going
to <q>work up a case</q> against him. Neither at the
inquest nor at the magisterial examination was the
police evidence very convincing; how disingenuous
it was the trial at the Old Bailey proved.</p>

<p>One little point must not be omitted. On the
26th April, a few hours after the discovery of the
wounded woman, a metal whistle was found sticking
in the mud, and as it was asserted that Pook was in
the habit of carrying a whistle, with which he used
to make signals to Alice Dwinford, this <q>find</q> was
deemed of great significance.</p>

<p>Of course, it was of the highest importance to trace
the hammer into the possession of Pook, and to do
this the police used every means, worthy and unworthy.
<pb n="86"/>
They managed to find an ironmonger named Sparshott,
who remembered that on the evening of April
24th a young man entered his shop and asked for a
chopper, which he wanted to use in some private
theatricals. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sparshott showed him a chopper,
which he said was too heavy and too expensive, and
he left without buying. This young man was seen
by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Sparshott and her son, and they agreed in
saying that the man who asked for the chopper wore
<emph>light</emph> trousers.</p>

<p>On the same evening a young man went into the
shop of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thomas, also an ironmonger, and purchased
a plasterer's hammer. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thomas found
the entry in her book, but could not remember the
customer. She was utterly unable to identify Pook
as the man who bought the hammer, and thereby
incurred considerable odium, and received anonymous
abusive letters in consequence. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sparshott, on
the contrary, though somewhat hazy as to the
appearance of Pook, managed to pick him out in the
prison yard of Newgate, though something like twenty
days had intervened. But in the meantime the
illustrated papers had published portraits of Pook, so
that Sparshott's identification was not very remarkable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Letheby, the famous analytical
chemist, had examined Pook's clothes and found
some spots of blood on the trousers and a hair six
inches long adhering to the knee. This, of course,
told against the accused, though not so heavily as it
might appear at first sight; for, surely, whoever
murdered poor Maria Clousen must himself have
had his clothes marked with big bloodstains, and not
with small blood-spots.</p>

<pb n="87"/>
<p>There were also other fragments of evidence which
might mean something or nothing. The proprietress
of a confectioner's shop some two and a half miles
from Kidbrooke Lane said that, about nine o'clock
on the evening of the 25th, Pook entered her shop
a little out of breath and with his face red, as if he had
been running. He asked her for a clothes brush to
brush his trousers, and she lent him one. Neither
she, nor a young woman who was in the shop at the
time, noticed that there was any mud on his trousers.</p>

<p>A man named Lazell also came forward and said
that he was in Kidbrooke Lane about ten minutes
to seven, and that he heard screams in a woman's
voice. It did not strike him, however, that the screams
were like those of a woman in danger, but more as
if larking was going on. At all events, he was not
alarmed.</p>

<p>This was about all that the inquest and the magisterial
examination revealed, and it did not amount to
very much; but thanks to what the police suppressed,
and the colouring that was given to the case, the
public at first took the official view. But before
the trial came on at the Old Bailey, opinion outside
was beginning to be shaken. The police themselves,
no doubt, felt they had a weak case, and they proceeded
to strengthen it after their own fashion, as
will be seen.</p>

<p>By the time the trial came on, before Chief Justice
Bovill, public excitement rose to a high pitch, and
opinion was strongly divided on the question.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General, Sir John Coleridge, prosecuted,
and in his opening address went over the case
as the police had presented it. Their theory was
<pb n="88"/>
that the murder had been committed between seven
and nine o'clock on the evening of the 25th, and that
the prisoner purchased the hammer at the shop of
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thomas the night before. The motive for the
murder, in their opinion, was that Pook had compromised
the girl; but the Solicitor-General did not
venture to theorise on this point.</p>

<p>One omission in Sir John Coleridge's speech was
noticeable. He said nothing about the locket to which
the police, in the early stage of the affair, had attached
so much importance. The reason for this was afterwards
made evident--the police had discovered that
the locket was not given to Maria Clousen by Edmund
Pook, but by a young man named Humphries. As
this fact told against their theory, they coolly suppressed
it; and it had to be brought to light by <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Huddlestone, the prisoner's counsel, and led to the
judge inflicting a rebuke on the Solicitor-General for
keeping back so material a piece of evidence in favour
of the prisoner.</p>

<p>Then Inspector Mulvaney and Superintendent
Griffin went into the box, and when they were cross-examined,
a pretty exhibition they made of themselves.
First of all, they were made to contradict
what they had stated before the coroner and the
magistrate; then they had to confess that they had
not the slightest ground for their insinuation that
Pook had written a letter to Maria Clousen, nor that
he had any particular acquaintance with her. Lastly,
it was shown they had carefully omitted to give Pook's
denials to the roving questions they had put to him
in the hope that he might say something they could
lay hold of.</p>

<pb n="89"/>
<p>This must have been an unpleasant dose for Mulvaney
and Griffin, and there was another in store over the
<q>additional evidence.</q></p>

<p>One witness who was brought forward stated that
he had found what he had at first called a pocket-handkerchief
about half a mile away from the scene
of the murder. This <q>handkerchief</q> he now called
a <q>duster,</q> and a police witness described it as a
portion of the lining of a woman's dress.</p>

<p>Then it turned out that the police were aware of
this discovery, but had said not a word about it to
the coroner or the magistrate. It did not tally with
their <q>theory,</q> therefore they had held their tongues.</p>

<p>This curious perversity, together with their contradictory
evidence, made Chief Justice Bovill lash out.
He did not mince matters as to the stupidity of the
police authorities.</p>

<p>They also dropped the matter of the whistle. No
evidence as to its alleged discovery was offered. It
was admitted to be of the commonest description,
and what was still more important was that two
whistles were found to be in Pook's possession.</p>

<p>But their worst blunder was the production of a
witness named Perrin, a comic singer, who had already
served two terms of imprisonment, who swore that
he was well acquainted with Pook. Perrin declared
he saw Pook go into the shop of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thomas on
the evening of the 25th and purchase a hammer,
and that he fixed the circumstance in his mind.
He bought some nails the same evening at the same
shop.</p>

<p>It was rather awkward for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Perrin when it
turned out that these nails were not bought of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
<pb n="90"/>
Thomas at all, she swearing positively that she had
never kept nails of the kind produced. It was also
odd that Perrin, knowing, as he asserted, Pook so well,
should be taken by the police to the prison yard to
identify him.</p>

<p>The jury promptly took the matter into their own
hands and refused to accept Perrin's evidence; they
also discarded the matter of the whistle.</p>

<p>The defence brought forward a number of witnesses
who accounted for the way in which Pook spent the
24th. As for the 25th, it was proved that he did
not leave his work till past seven,, and though there
was no evidence as to his particular occupation between
a quarter-past seven and nine--he could not, of course,
open his mouth on this point himself--there was
presumptive evidence that he was at Lewisham.
The blood on his clothes was fully accounted for;
but even this was scarcely needed, for <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Letheby
could not tell whether the blood he detected was that
of an animal or human being, nor could he say if the
hair was that of a man or a woman.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Huddlestone's contention was that, from the
evidence of Constable Gunn, the murder was perpetrated
between half-past two and four o'clock in the
morning, when he discovered her on his beat; and this
seems reasonable.</p>

<p>The summing-up was distinctly in favour of the
prisoner, and when the jury found him not guilty,
which they immediately did, there was such a scene
of enthusiasm as is rarely witnessed in a court of
justice.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Greenwich raised a fund of £200
to pay for Pook's expenses, and a prosecution for
<pb n="91"/>
perjury was commenced against Mulvaney and Griffin,
but the grand jury threw out the bill.</p>

<p>The <q>Eltham mystery</q> was a subject of controversy
for a long time. A pamphlet was written,
and a public meeting held to discuss the matter, but
nothing came of it.</p>

<head type="main">Elizabeth Camp</head>
<head type="sub">The Puzzle of the Pestle</head>

<p>Of the four murders in railway trains recorded
in English criminal annals, the victims in two
instances were women, and in each case the assassin
escaped and the police were completely helpless.
Dark rumours in connection with the most recent of
these mysteries--that of Miss Money in the Merstham
tunnel on the South Eastern Railway--were hinted
at in connection with another mysterious tragedy
which happened some months afterwards, but it
may be that such rumours were based on conjecture,
and on nothing else. In the latter case, the veil so
tightly drawn, due either to the cunning or the good
luck of the murderer, remains exactly as it was,
despite the gruesome exhibit in the Black Museum
at Scotland Yard, which exhibit, at the time it was
found, was thought would prove to be a certain clue.</p>

<p>One February day towards the end of the last
century, Elizabeth Camp went out of the Good Intent,
a public house in East Street, a well-known market
thoroughfare of Walworth, in the south of London,
where she was employed as barmaid, on a visit, first
to her sister, a <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Skeat, living at Hammersmith,
<pb n="93"/>
and thence to see another sister, a <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Haynes, who
resided at Hounslow.</p>

<p>The girl carried out her programme, arriving at
Hounslow some time in the afternoon. She had not
much money with her, and of what she had she gave
to her sister at Hounslow thirty-eight shillings, taking
the money out of a green purse and saying as she did
so:</p>

<p><q>I've three shillings left.</q></p>

<p>She wore no jewellery to excite the cupidity of the
evil-disposed; she had even left her gold watch and
chain at her home in Walworth, and when she set
out with her sister to walk to Hounslow station,
that she might be robbed was about the last idea
likely to enter her head.</p>

<p>The girl intended to catch the 7.42 train to Waterloo,
and on taking a second-class ticket <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Haynes
asked her why she travelled second-class.</p>

<p><q>Oh,</q> said she, lightly, <q>there are fewer and
nicer people.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah!</q> objected her sister, <q>but the third-class
affords better protection to women.</q></p>

<p>Elizabeth bade her sister good-bye and took her
seat in an empty second-class compartment. If her
sister's warning dwelt in her mind, it was probably
accompanied by the reflection that if she were attacked
she could defend herself. Elizabeth Camp was a
stout, well-built young woman, weighing something
like fourteen stone.</p>

<p>The 7.42 train was a slow one, due at Waterloo at
about half-past eight, and stopping at all stations
excepting Queen's Road, Battersea, the station nearest
Vauxhall where tickets were collected. When at
<pb n="94"/>
Vauxhall the collector went along the train, but he
did not trouble about the second-class compartment at
the rear end. It seemed to him to be empty.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a young man was at Waterloo
terminus anxiously awaiting the arrival of the 7.42
train from Hounslow. His name was Berry; he
was in business in East Street, and was Elizabeth
Camp's sweetheart. Some mysterious foreboding of
danger was oppressing him, and when the train
slowed into the station he asked to be allowed to go
on the platform to meet the person he expected.
This request, however, was not granted, and he had
to remain outside the barrier.</p>

<p>The passengers passed through the gate, but Elizabeth
Camp was not among them. Then a little group
of officials gathered round a carriage at the end of
the train, and by and by it leaked out that something
terrible had happened. Berry waited about for some
time, and then learned that a young woman had been
found dead in the train and had been taken to <abbr>St.</abbr>
Thomas's Hospital.</p>

<p>Instantly Berry's dark forebodings took form, and
jumping into a cab he hastened to the hospital, arriving
there soon after the body had been taken into the
hall.</p>

<p>One glance told the poor young man that his strange
fears had been only too truly realised. It was indeed
his sweetheart who, terribly bruised and battered,
was lying dead before him.</p>

<p><q>That's enough!</q> he gasped, and kissing her icy
forehead he staggered away, overcome with emotion,
as well he might be.</p>

<p>The discovery was made after the passengers had
<pb n="95"/>
cleared out of the train at Waterloo, a carriage cleaner
having commenced his customary duty, and in the
course of his work coming upon the sight.</p>

<p>The position of the body was this: the head and
upper portion were pushed some way under the seat
and the legs projecting across the floor under the
opposite seat. The body was close to the door, and
this, no doubt, was why it was hidden from the
ticket collector at Vauxhall, and he did not trouble
to look into the compartment.</p>

<p>According to the first impression of the railway
officials, there were signs of a struggle, blood was
on the cushion and on the mat on the floor. Her
clothes were much torn, her pockets were empty, a
green purse from which the contents had been
abstracted was near the body, her umbrella was lying
on the floor. A brooch was still upon her--either
the miscreant had not time to take it or thought it
was of no value, which, indeed, was the case. A
pair of bone cuff links were afterwards found, but to
the assassin there was not the slightest clue. He had
done his work too well.</p>

<p>A close and systematic search of the up-line on which
the train had travelled was made at early dawn, and
close to Wandsworth station, on the Putney side, a
singular discovery was made in the shape of a pestle
covered with blood and hair. This pestle was a
formidable weapon, weighing as it did fifty ounces.
It was of the kind of earthenware known as <q>iron
stone china</q>; it was not new, and had on it the
figure 6 or 9, according to the way it was looked at.</p>

<p>The greatest excitement was caused by the discovery,
and the weapon being of such an unusual kind, it was
<pb n="96"/>
thought that the capture of the girl's unknown
assailant would soon follow. But, unhappily, this
did not prove to be the case.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, any number of rumours were in the
air as to the motive for the murder, and stories as to
possible clues which might lead to the identification
of the guilty man began to be circulated.</p>

<p>One of these stories was that on the night of the
murder, about half-past eight, a tallish man, wearing
a long, dark macintosh with red lining, went into the
Elephant and Castle just outside Vauxhall station,
and hurriedly asked for brandy. His face was pale
and haggard, so the barmaid said, and he was <q>all
of a tremble,</q> so much so, he could hardly lift the
glass to his lips.</p>

<p>Another story was that a man got out of the train
at Clapham Junction with one of his hands bound
up in a handkerchief. The Clapham Junction story
was soon explained, and that from Vauxhall received
no credence.</p>

<p>A third story from Wandsworth at first seemed to
have some probability in it, and if the statement made
were correct, the circumstances were certainly rather
curious.</p>

<p>It was said that a man was noticed leaving the train
at Wandsworth station in a terribly excited condition,
rushing out before the other passengers and jumping
down the stairs three or four at a time. He was
described as wearing a long black coat, and being
otherwise well dressed. He then seems to have
entered a public house called the Alma, and hastily
drank two <q>goes</q> of brandy. It was noticed that
his dress was in disorder, and that his tie was wholly
<pb n="97"/>
out of place. On someone calling his attention to
his necktie he hurriedly adjusted it, and running out
of the house, jumped into a passing cab.</p>

<p>This story appears to have been thought good
enough to be embellished with further details, and
these were soon forthcoming. The man seemed to be
flush of money, said more than one witness, and
insisted upon treating the customers at the bar. Then
one of the group exclaimed suddenly, <q>What have
you been up to? You're all over blood!</q></p>

<p><q>It's not blood,</q> the man replied, <q>it's furniture
polish. Can't you tell the difference?</q></p>

<p>Another of the group passed his hand down the
front of the man's waistcoat, and on finding his hand
stained, said:</p>

<p><q>That's not furniture polish--it's blood. Your
waistcoat's saturated with it.</q></p>

<p>The landlord also noticed blood on the man's shirt-front,
and on his waistcoat, but as nothing was then
known of the murder, nobody thought of detaining
him, and after more talk he departed.</p>

<p>This tale was full of improbabilities. That a man,
after committing a cold-blooded murder and after
succeeding in escaping, should go into a public house
which, if the hue and cry were raised, would be certain
to be visited, and should fling about his money and
exhibit his bloodstains, savours of lunacy. However
this may be, the story was regarded seriously.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the poor girl had so little
money and no valuables upon her, it was at first
assumed by some that the motive could not have been
robbery. Miss Camp's history was investigated: it
turned out to be thoroughly uneventful and reputable.
<pb n="98"/>
She had no questionable acquaintances, and though
there was a former sweetheart, nothing could be said
against him.</p>

<p>People, however, persisted in talking, and on the
strength of a woman's idle gossip, a perfectly innocent
and respectable resident of Hounslow was taken to
the police station and detained for some hours while
enquiries were made, and the thing having been found
to be a mare's-nest, he was released.</p>

<p>Shortly after this episode the coroner opened the
inquest, but the only evidence submitted was that
of the surgeon who made the post-mortem examination,
and who also inspected the carriage immediately
after the crime was discovered.</p>

<p>From this evidence we learn that the impression
made by the unfortunate young woman's body showed
she was seated with her back to the engine on the
near side of the carriage. Above this impression on
the woodwork, even above the hat rack, was to be
seen the result of the first blow with the pestle in the
splashes of blood. On the opposite seat were the
remains of a pool of blood, showing <q>that the woman
had attempted to struggle with her assailant.</q> (This
statement was, however, afterwards contradicted.)
Under the seat at the other end of the compartment,
and opposite where the woman had been sitting, was
a pool of congealed blood, while the thick fibre rug
also bore marks of blood.</p>

<p>All this went to indicate that the murderer, after
committing his fearful deed, must himself have been
blood-stained, especially as he must have dragged
the body where it was found, so as to hide it from
the view of the ticket collector.</p>

<pb n="99"/>
<p>The inquest was adjourned for a month, and about
a week after its opening sitting the police arrested
a man at Reading named Marshall. They were put
on the scent by a railway porter at Paddington seeing
a resemblance between a man who was leaving by
the last train for Reading, and the description of the
mysterious person who flourished his money and his
bloodstains at the Alma public house. But no charge
was made against Marshall, and he was only kept
under surveillance.</p>

<p>When the inquest was resumed, a little mystery
was caused by the coroner handing <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Skeat slips
of paper with names written upon them, and asking
her if she knew them. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Skeat said she did, and
there the mystery ended. At least, nothing more
was heard of it.</p>

<p>The coroner devoted himself chiefly to probing
into the family affairs of the deceased, and her movements
on the fatal day. No result, however, followed.
One curious thing may be noted. In the mouth of
a speaking tube at Waterloo station communicating
with the kitchens a handkerchief bearing the name
of Camp was found stuffed. The writing did not
resemble that of Elizabeth, nor was any explanation
of the coincidence ever given.</p>

<p>Nor was curiosity satisfied in regard to the evidence
produced relating to the man who was seen to dash
out of the train at Wandsworth. One passenger
who saw him said he wore a top hat and a frock coat,
and that he had a dark moustache. The porter on
the platform did not notice anyone in a hurry, nor
could he remember what any of the passengers (there
were only six) who got out of this particular train
<pb n="100"/>
were like. Another porter saw a man come down
the stairs two or three at a time, but, according to
this witness, the man was wearing a bowler hat and
a top coat.</p>

<p>An odd thing was that the ticket issued to Miss
Camp could not be found. Of course, it might have
been in her purse and carried away with the shilling
or two which was all the plunder with which the
murderer enriched himself.</p>

<p>Much more important was the question of the
spot where the murder was committed. As the pestle
was found on the Putney side of Wandsworth station,
it was no doubt thrown away when the deed was
done, the murderer getting out at Wandsworth.
Maybe he was the man in a hurry. The murderer
certainly would escape at the first opportunity, and
would not wait until the train reached Vauxhall,
where the chances were against him.</p>

<p>How was the murder done? According to one
surgeon, the blows must have been inflicted while
the deceased was sitting upright. Afterwards, she
must have fallen forward on to the floor on her left
side. The injuries were on the top and across the
head, and there were no other marks of violence, nor
were there any signs of a struggle. The opinion,
therefore, of the railway officials on this point was
shown to be incorrect.</p>

<p>The surgeon's evidence was corroborated by that
of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Bond, of Westminster Hospital, who did not
think the deceased could have cried out or resisted
after the first blow was struck. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Bond also made
the strange statement that it was quite possible a
woman could have inflicted the wounds. Of course,
<pb n="101"/>
had there been any woman who had jealous hatred
of poor Elizabeth, a motive might have been supplied,
but this was not the case.</p>

<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Bond added, what indeed was pretty evident,
that the assassin must have been splashed about the
face and clothes with blood, while all the wounds
might have been inflicted in less than a minute--by
a shower of blows. It is but four minutes' ride from
Putney to Wandsworth, so that the murderer had to
be swift in his deadly work.</p>

<p>Arthur Marshall, the young man who was arrested
on suspicion at Reading, was brought up to give
evidence, and a more unsatisfactory witness could
hardly be imagined. Apparently he was of weak
intellect, and by his answers he made himself an
object of suspicion, while his doings about the time
of the murder were altogether unaccountable.</p>

<p>Marshall seems to have left home on the day of
the murder, and he returned three days afterwards,
about three o'clock in the morning. His mother
said he was subject to delusions, and that he left
home to <q>list for a soldier because he could not bide
it any longer.</q> He had a notion <q>the police were
after him,</q> and this notion he had for eighteen months.</p>

<p>The evidence given by those who had seen the
blood-stained man in the Alma was quite unconvincing.
The potman could not identify Marshall
as being the man, but the manager thought he could.
Another witness also picked him out, but admitted
there was a <q>difference.</q> A fourth witness was sure
the man in the Alma had side whiskers and a moustache,
but Marshall had none, nor had he ever had
any.</p>

<pb n="102"/>
<p>As for Marshall, he burst into tears when he stood
before the coroner, and so contradicted himself and
prevaricated, that at last the coroner lost his patience
and told him to <q>stand down.</q></p>

<p>Then came the summing-up, after which the jury

<head type="main">Sarah Millson</head>
<head type="sub">The Secret of a London Warehouse</head>

<p>Difficult as it is to fathom the motives which
lead to the tragedies of Kate Dungay, Jane
Roberts, and Maria Clousen, there is at least some
scope for the imagination. Love or jealousy, it may
be hazarded, had a hand in the matter. But with
the mystery of the murders of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Noel we get no assistance from such a supposition.
The first was a widow wanting a few years of fifty;
the second was middle-aged and had a husband
living. There is not the slightest suggestion in any
of these puzzles of a man in the case.</p>

<p>In Cannon Street, in the very heart of the City of
London, stands a plain building of stone--solid,
prosaic, uninteresting--the very last place one
would associate with crime and romance.</p>

<p>The story begins on a rainy evening in April, when
two women were sitting in one of the upper rooms
overlooking the street. One of these women, the
elder of the two, slender, graceful, fair-haired, and, in
spite of her years, retaining much of her girlish beauty,
was Sarah Millson, the housekeeper. The other was
Elizabeth Lowes, the cook.</p>

<pb n="104"/>
<p>They were old friends, acquaintance having begun
some ten years before both entering the service of
<abbr>Messrs.</abbr> Bevington, leather merchants, who owned
the warehouse, about the same time.</p>

<p>But though friends, they had never exchanged
confidences. Elizabeth Lowes, it was true, was open
and frank enough, but then she had nothing to conceal.
Sarah Millson, on the contrary, was very reticent,
said little about herself, and her past was a sealed
book to her companion.</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson's husband had been dead six years.
He too was in the employ of the firm, and had lived
with his wife on the premises up to the time of his
death. On becoming a widow, life with her, in the
sedate prosaic warehouse, so far as one knows, went
on in the monotonous routine of an old-established
business. In the day time the door of the rooms
occupied by housekeeper and cook was kept closed,
but at seven o'clock in the evening, after the employees
had left, it was thrown open. The two servants had
then the run of the house, and their friends seemingly
knew this, for it was generally after seven when they
came.</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson occasionally had visitors, among them
her sister and a Miss Cox. Once a man called, and
his appearance excited Elizabeth Lowes's curiosity.</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson was out when this man came, and
Elizabeth opened the door. She saw a short, thickset
man, with dark hair growing low down on the
forehead. He asked for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson, and when he
heard she was not in, with the tantalising reticence
which people often exhibit, refused to leave his
name.</p>

<pb n="105"/>
<p><q>He was a little short, dark man,</q> said Elizabeth
to Sarah, when the latter returned.</p>

<p><q>Oh, yes!</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson, with a curious look
in her eyes. <q>I know who he is.</q> But she said no
more. Elizabeth never saw him again.</p>

<p>One evening, about a year and nine months after
the appearance of this man, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson went down
to the front door of the warehouse, and in a few minutes
returned and somewhat agitatedly said to Elizabeth
Lowes that a man had called and demanded a sovereign
from her.</p>

<p><q>Will you lend me one?</q> she added, and Elizabeth
did so.</p>

<p>While Sarah was downstairs Elizabeth looked out
of the window and saw the man leave the premises
and go away in a cab. Who this man was Sarah
Millson never explained.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 11th of April, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson
let a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kepps, in the employ of the firm, out of
the premises at ten minutes to eight. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kepps
was always the last to leave. She then returned
upstairs.</p>

<p><q>They're all gone, Elizabeth,</q> said she.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was sewing at the table and presently
Sarah, unoccupied and restless, wandered about the
room, now and again stopping at the window, where
she stood watching the drops trickling slowly down
the glass. Finally, apparently tired of doing nothing,
she went into her bedroom.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past nine the door bell on the ground
floor clanged. Sarah Millson came hurriedly from
her room and said to Elizabeth, <q>I'll go. It's for
me,</q> and the cook heard her rapid footsteps descending
<pb n="106"/>
the various flights of stairs until they died away in
the distance.</p>

<p>An hour went by--an hour of dead silence, broken
only by the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece,
the subdued hum of distant wheels in the streets,
and the pattering of raindrops on the window panes.
Sarah was still downstairs.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Lowes went on quietly sewing, when all
at once a sickening feeling of terror seized her. Nothing
had happened to cause any alarm, yet she trembled
from head to foot, and a cold sweat bedewed her
forehead. The very vagueness of the sensation,
the absence of any cause, seemed only to increase
her nervousness. She dropped her work,
and her eyes rested on the clock. It was a quarter-past
ten.</p>

<p><q>I can't endure this any longer,</q> she murmured.
<q>I'll go and see what Sarah's doing. It's strange
she should be away so long.</q></p>

<p>Elizabeth had heard not a sound, but there was a
good reason for this. The street door opened into
a lobby which was shut off by swing doors from the
counting house and from the stairs by a passage.
The room where Elizabeth had been sitting was on
the second floor, and only a loud noise from the passage
or lobby would there be audible.</p>

<p>Elizabeth lighted a candle and descended the stair
case, her fears growing, though she knew not why.
Suddenly she stopped. Her blood seemed to turn
to ice. At the foot of the stairs lay some object, its
shape indefinable in the gloom. Elizabeth forced
herself to go down half a dozen more stairs, and then
the dim shadowy object resolved itself into the form
<pb n="107"/>
of a woman, her feet towards the stairs, and the head
in the direction of the swing doors.</p>

<p><q>I knew something had happened,</q> exclaimed
the frightened woman.</p>

<p>She stooped and took hold of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson's hand.
The feel of that hand so cold struck a chill to her
heart.</p>

<p><q>Sarah! Sarah!</q> she cried.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Then she held the candle close to the prostrate
woman's face. A frenzied shriek of horror burst
from her pallid lips. She saw a mass of fair hair
lying dabbled in a crimson pool already beginning
to congeal.</p>

<p>Elizabeth sprung to her feet, and rushing to the door,
opened it. Heavy rain was falling, and a young
woman was standing in the doorway for shelter.</p>

<p><q>Will you come in?</q> implored Elizabeth. <q>I'm
afraid someone has fallen down in a fit!</q></p>

<p>The young woman made a step forward, and then,
suddenly seized with fright, exclaimed:</p>

<p><q>Oh, I can't, I can't!</q> and ran away.</p>

<p>Elizabeth dared not go back, though no suspicion
of the terrible truth had entered her mind. She
waited on the doorstep till a policeman went by.</p>

<p>The constable looked at the body, said nothing,
but rushed for a surgeon. The surgeon's trained
eye saw the nature of the case in a moment.</p>

<p><q>The woman is dead. She has been murdered!</q>
said he curtly.</p>

<p>It was true. Poor Sarah Millson was lying with her
face turned to the right, and with the right arm
extended. The head was frightfully battered, and
<pb n="108"/>
she must have fallen directly she was struck, for her
dress was not in disorder, and there was no sign of a
struggle.</p>

<p>The police were face to face with an impenetrable
mystery. The murderer had not left a single clue
behind him. A small crowbar, used in packing goods,
with a hammer at one end and a chisel at the other,
was found on a board near the body; but this gave
no assistance. It belonged to the house, and was
perfectly clean. Whatever weapon the assassin had
employed, it was not the crowbar.</p>

<p>The motive? It was not robbery. The key of the
safe, with which the housekeeper was entrusted, was
found in her pocket; so also was seventeen shillings, her
own money. Not a thing in the warehouse or counting
house was disturbed.</p>

<p>When the police came to examine <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson's
box they thought they had made a <q>find</q> in the
following letter:</p>

<q type="letter">
<p><q>Dear <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson,--The bearer of this I have
sent to you as my adviser. I have taken this course
as I have received so much annoyance from <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Webber that I can put up with it no longer. He
will propose terms to you which you can accept or
not at your pleasure. Failing your agreeing to
this proposal, he is instructed by me to see <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Bevington or <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harris and explain to them how
the matter stands. You know yourself what reasons
you put forth for borrowing the money (doctor's
bills and physicians for your husband), which you
know was not so. I shall also have him bring your
sister before <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bevington if necessary, or your
<pb n="109"/>
obstinacy compels my adviser to go to that extreme.
--George Terry.</q></p>
</q>

<p>On the back of this letter was written:</p>

<q type="letter">
<p><q>Received of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson £1--W. Denton, for
George Terry, 26 Old Change.</q></p>
</q>

<p>The police soon got on the track of Terry; but it
was at once made clear, from the evidence produced,
that he was not the murderer.</p>

<p>Terry, it appeared, was an old acquaintance of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Millson, who, wanting some money, was introduced
by him to a <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Sarah Webber, of whom she borrowed
thirty pounds, part of which she paid back. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Webber looked upon Terry as partly responsible for
the debt, and when Sarah Millson got into arrears,
she worried Terry for the balance. Terry, however,
was in low water, and making the acquaintance of
Denton (whose real name was Smith), this man
undertook to squeeze some money out of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson.
Accordingly the above letter was written; Smith,
alias Denton, called upon Sarah Millson and obtained
a sovereign from her as the endorsement on the
letter indicated. Smith was a lazy ne'er-do-well sort
of fellow, a hat maker by trade, whose mother said
he had always been a trial to her.</p>

<p>With the fatuity the police sometimes show, they
chose to make up their minds that Smith was the
murderer, and to twist their theory into facts they
entered upon a series of blunders.</p>

<p>Smith was traced to Eton, and at once arrested
on suspicion. So far, at all events, they were justified,
as, in his mother's house, where he lived, they found
<pb n="110"/>
a coat, waistcoat and trousers, all apparently spotted
with blood. To the question put by the officer to
the mother, <q>What time did her son come home on
the night of the murder?</q> she could give no definite
answer, as she was in bed at the time.</p>

<p>Smith never attempted to deny that he had been
on two or three occasions to Cannon Street, and that
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson had paid him money, but he emphatically
declared he was not there on the night of the murder,
but had spent the evening with friends at Eton. He
swore he had not been in London since February 1st,
but admitted that he had called on <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson at
Terry's instigation.</p>

<p><q>Did you write the receipts signed <q>Denton</q> on
the back of the letter?</q> asked the detective.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> said Smith, <q>I sometimes use that name.
I called three times at Cannon Street. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Millson
paid me two sovereigns and I wrote her a receipt each
time. I know it was all wrong about the money,
and I knew Terry was not entitled to it. That is the
reason I did not sign my right name.</q></p>

<p>It was awkward for Smith that his coat, waistcoat
and trousers should be spotted apparently with blood,
for these spots made the police cocksure that they had
tracked down the murderer. So certain, indeed, were
they, that they did not trouble to look further, but
set to work to get up evidence against him. The method
they adopted was unscrupulous, unfair and stupid.</p>

<p>It was most important to show that Smith was in
London on the night of the murder, and to prove this
the prosecution brought forward a <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Robbins,
housekeeper at <abbr>No.</abbr> 1 Cannon Street, next door to
<abbr>Messrs.</abbr> Bevington.</p>

<pb n="111"/>
<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Robbins said she returned home on the night
of the murder about ten minutes past ten, and as she
rang her bell, she heard a violent slamming of the door
at <abbr>Messrs.</abbr> Bevington's and saw a man leave the
house. He gave her a side look as he passed, the
light of her hall lamp shining on his face. She believed
Smith was the man. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Robbins' servant was also
produced. The servant did not see this man on
the night of the murder, but thought she had seen him
coming out of the house on another night.</p>

<p>This evidence might or might not be important,
but the method the police adopted to secure identification
was, to say the least, peculiar.</p>

<p>The inspector, having previously warned the two
women to be at their door so as to see if they could
recognise anyone, sent the prisoner walking between two
plain-clothes men, three other plain-clothes men
following behind; and by doing this the innocent
inspector thought the women would never imagine
the man was a prisoner, but would take him for one
of the crowd. Of course <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Robbins picked Smith
out.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Robbins proved too much, for
she also recognised the alleged murderer in somebody
else who was riding past her in a cab at the very
moment she was trying to identify Smith. The fact
was, the police, to deceive the crowd which was waiting
at the station to see the prisoner taken before the
magistrate, put handcuffs on a constable and sent
him in a cab while the real prisoner was walked along
in the manner just described. Hence, to say the
least, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Robbins' <soCalled>identification</soCalled> was very unsatisfactory.</p>

<pb n="112"/>
<p>Meanwhile it was clearly established that, in the
early part of the evening of the murder, Smith was
seen walking in the direction of Slough station, while
it was equally certain that he was at Windsor at a
late hour. What had he done between these times?</p>

<p>The police answered the question by asserting that
he had caught the 7.43 train from Slough to Paddington,
arriving there at 8.40, that he had reached Cannon
Street at ten minutes past nine, committed the murder,
and had rushed back to Paddington in time to catch
the last train to Windsor. Quick work with a vengeance,
for the police had to admit that Smith was at
Windsor between eleven and twelve.</p>

<p>However, this theory was knocked on the head by
the evidence for the defence. Some eleven or twelve
witnesses were called, who conclusively proved that
Smith was in their company the whole of the evening
of the 11th playing cards, and if ever an alibi was
distinctly established, it was in the case of William
Smith.</p>

<p>A small, but not unimportant, point was that the
spots and stains on his garments, which the police
were so sure were blood, turned out on examination
by a medical expert not to be blood at all, but <q>cogging,</q>
some material used in hat-making, Smith
being a hatter by trade.</p>

<p>The opinion of the jury was emphatically expressive.
After the judge had summed up, they did not wait to
be asked the formal question whether they had agreed
upon a verdict, but pronounced the prisoner to be
<q>Not guilty.</q> The judge, too, went out of his way
to suggest that something more than this was due
to the accused--he ought to be declared to be innocent.</p>

<pb n="113"/>
<p><q>My lord,</q> said the foreman, <q>we think so, too.</q></p>

<p>The police, either exhausted or disgusted by
their abortive attempts, made no further efforts, and
from that day to this--fifty-eight years--nothing
more has been heard of the murder in Cannon Street.</p>

<head type="main"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Noel</head>
<head type="sub">The Mystery of a Ramsgate Kitchen</head>

<p>It was a hot May and the Ramsgate season had
begun early. Whitsuntide was just over, and for
the time of the year the favourite Kentish watering-place
was fairly full. For reasons which will be
apparent later on, this fact added to the mystery of
the grim tragedy which was enacted on the 14th May
1893.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> William Noel, a butcher carrying on business
at 9 Adelphi Terrace, Grange Road, on this particular
day--it was Sunday--dined alone with his wife, and
Nelly Wilson, who waited on them, noticed nothing
out of the way in the manner of either. They had
been married some years, were past middle age, and
were regarded as a very happy couple.</p>

<p>The Noels were Wesleyans, but did not attend the
same place of worship. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Noel was a Sunday-school
teacher at the chapel at <abbr>St.</abbr> Lawrence, and left the house
at about twenty minutes past two to go to his class.
Nelly Wilson, whose parents lived at <abbr>St.</abbr> Lawrence,
went home some twenty minutes before this, and
from two o'clock to twenty minutes past, Noel and his
wife were alone in the house. If anything took place
<pb n="115"/>
then, other than contained in Noel's own narrative, it
will for ever remain untold.</p>

<p>Noel's account of what happened during this brief
space was this:</p>

<p><q>We both sat down to dinner about twenty minutes
past one. After dinner we had the usual family prayers
and I next went up to the back sitting room, leaving
my wife in the kitchen. I got my books together in
preparation for afternoon's school, and my wife came
up to me while so doing. She wanted the collection
money on the table and remarked that there was
just ten shillings. She went to the front sitting room
and returned with a china bowl into which she put
the money and took the bowl away with her to the
front room. I did not see her alive after that. I
left the house about five minutes afterwards, it being
then between fifteen and twenty minutes past two.
I left the house by the front side door without
speaking to my wife, and was at the school at about
2.25.</q></p>

<p>Noel appears to have returned to the house about
4.20 and found the front side door (which opened
into a passage) fastened. When he went out he left
it unfastened. He then tried the scullery door but
this was bolted, and thinking his wife had gone out
for a walk he strolled about for a little time. On his
return the side door was still locked, and on knocking
a second time the dog barked. Noel then went round
to the back, and getting a pair of steps pulled the
window down (the window was closed but unhasped),
the dog barking furiously.</p>

<p><q>I put my head through the window to speak to
the dog, and on doing so saw my wife lying on the
<pb n="116"/>
floor with her shoulders and head against the kitchen
door. I called to her but received no answer. I
thought perhaps she had gone into a swoon with no
one near to help her--she was subject to sick bouts
and so it did not surprise me at seeing her in that
position.&#x2026; After standing on the steps and
looking at my wife I went for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harman</q> (his
next-door neighbour).</p>

<p>Harman came, mounted the steps, called <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Noel by name, and as she did not answer said he thought
she was dead, and suggested that Noel should go for
a policeman and he (Harman) would go for a doctor.
Noel accordingly tried to find a policeman, and while
so occupied met a friend named Sanders.</p>

<p><q>Noel,</q> said Sanders, <q>came and touched me on
the shoulders and said, <q>I believe my wife is dead in
the house.</q> I said, <q>Never.</q> I said, <q>Do you think
she has fainted?</q> He replied that he did not think
she had. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Noel looked rather upset and was very
pale. I followed him round to the back of the house;
there were some steps standing by the window, the
top sash of which was down. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Noel went up the
steps first and said, <q>There she lies.</q> I said, <q>Come
down and let me look.</q> I went up the steps, and on
looking in at the window I saw deceased lying there.
I said to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Noel, <q>For goodness' sake get in as
quickly as you can.</q> He then got in over the sash.
I told him to undo the scullery door, which he did.
I went to the body first. I rushed in past <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Noel.
I said, <q>Good God, she's shot!</q> He said, <q>What
shall I do?</q> I said, <q>Send for a policeman.</q> The
dog,</q> added Saunders, <q>was standing or sitting by
the body looking at it.</q></p>

<pb n="117"/>

<p>Noel then took Sanders through the house, remarking
that the motive was robbery, despite the fact that his
wife had five rings on and a watch and chain, all of
which were untouched, and showed Sanders the condition
of the rooms as a proof.</p>

<p>In the sitting room a writing desk was smashed;
in the back bedroom a cash box had been broken open
and the contents (believed by Noel to have consisted.
of about £9, an old cheque for £2, and a post office
savings bank book) taken. A chest of drawers in
a bedroom had been opened and the linen in one
drawer disturbed; in the shop were two bowls, one
containing about 13<abbr>s.</abbr> in silver and the other copper,
but these had passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>In the course of this search it is to be noticed that
Noel omitted to take his friend into the best room
on the first floor over the shop, and it was all the
more singular because in this room <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Noel had
placed the collection money in a china bowl. This
money was intact.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the doctor fetched by Harman declared
that the poor woman had been shot dead. His first
impression was that she had committed suicide, but
as no pistol could be found he altered his mind.</p>

<p>Had there been a struggle? Noel's impression was
that there had, but the doctor thought not. One
of the eyes was blackened; but this was due to the
natural <choice><reg>discolouration</reg><orig>discoloration</orig></choice> after death. Near the body
were <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Noel's gold spectacles, the frame bent and
the glasses broken.</p>

<p>Mystery seemed to follow mystery. Noel said
that when he went out of the house he left the door
unfastened and the key in the lock. But no key was
<pb n="118"/>
to be found. The inference was that the murderer,
finding the door unfastened, had entered, committed
the murder, laid his hands hurriedly on whatever he
could, and had left by the same door, locking it and
taking away the key. But there were reasons why
this theory is not tenable.</p>

<p>The argument that the motive was robbery is not
convincing. It is hard to see how the jewellery <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Noel was wearing escaped the robber's notice. When
his victim was dead he was at liberty to roam through
the house. Why did he not go into the best room
and into the shop? In both of these places there was
money exposed to view. What also of the dog?</p>

<p>As if to baffle enquiry, a key, together with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Noel's bonnet and parasol, was lying on the bed when
Sanders went through the house. About this key,
declared by Noel to be a duplicate of the one belonging
to the side door, Noel said he knew very little. He
had seen it once in a basket on his wife's dressing
table, but he could not say that it was ever used and
he did not know where it came from.</p>

<p>But the puzzle of the dog was the most bewildering
of all. The animal was a retriever and said by several
witnesses to be very savage. It was, however, attached
to its master and mistress. Presuming the motive
was robbery, what was the dog doing when the thief
entered the house? One would expect it would have
attacked the intruder, but it did not even bark.
Noel suggested to the police inspector that he might
have shut the dog in the lobby when he went out.
<q>Yes,</q> said the inspector, <q>but the thieves would
have to pass him in going upstairs.</q> This, of course,
is obvious. There is also the difficulty of accounting
<pb n="119"/>
for finding the dog by the body. If it had been shut
up, how did it get into the room? The police, without
doubt, had a hard nut to crack, and it must be confessed
that they adopted the very worst method of
cracking it. They first formulated a theory and then
proceeded to find evidence to fit it. They could only
account for the silence of the dog by the assumption
that the murderer was well known to the animal.
Now the only person who fulfilled their requirements
was William Noel, and they started on their task of
proving that he was the guilty person by boldly stating
that, in their opinion, the robbery was a <soCalled>got-up</soCalled>
affair--that in spite of appearances there had been
no robbery at all!</p>

<p>To establish their case it was necessary to prove
that the woman had been shot between two o'clock
and twenty minutes past, and they laboured the point
for all that it was worth. Several persons had heard
noises at different times. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Dyer, a neighbour,
put the time at about three o'clock, but <q>it might
have been earlier or later.</q></p>

<p>Alice King, the servant of the Harmans next door,
heard a noise about five minutes past two, but it did
not occur to her that it was the report of a pistol.
She was not particularly precise as to the time, and
could only fix it by declaring that her household
duties occupied her up to five minutes past two, when
she was in her bedroom and heard the noise. At
2.15 she heard the Noels' side door shut and she said
to herself, <q>There goes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Noel,</q> because she had
heard him go out on previous Sundays at that
time.</p>

<p>Miss Susanna Miller, when passing Noel's house at
<pb n="120"/>
heard a noise like a door being slammed, while
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Dalton, a neighbour; heard a sound at 2.45 which
she was positive was a gun or pistol being fired. Here
then were four different times stated at which noises--each
of which might or might not have been the
report of a firearm--were heard.</p>

<p>To test both the disposition of the dog and the
accuracy of Alice King's testimony, the police on
the following Sunday fired a pistol in Noel's house
about one o'clock. The dog was in the room at the
time and it only slunk away. The same result followed
when a bottle of soda water was opened. But the
absence of any demonstration might have been because
it knew its master was in an adjoining room. As for
Alice King, who was at dinner with her master and
mistress when the pistol was fired, she remarked,
<q>That's like the noise I heard last Sunday.</q> It may
have been so, but whether or not, the experiment was
of little value.</p>

<p>The medical evidence as to the time of the murder
was equally uncertain. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Fox saw the body at
4.27 and, though death had taken place quite two
hours before, he would not have been surprised if it
had been three hours; he certainly would have
been surprised had he been told she had been dead
only one and a half hours. Another doctor was of
much the same opinion. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Noel, it appeared,
had been shot at the side of the head: the bullet
took a slightly downward direction, came out at the
other side, struck against the panel of the door, and
was deflected into the next room, where it was found.
From the expression of the woman's face, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Fox
did not think she saw her murderer.</p>

<pb n="121"/>
<p>No theory was advanced either by the police or by
the doctors as to the position of the woman at the
time she was shot--a curious omission, as this was a
point which, could it have been determined, would
have been of considerable significance. The course
taken by the bullet shows that the door was open at
the time, and this disposes of Noel's suggestion concerning
the shutting-up of the dog. But it does not
explain the passiveness of the animal. If <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Fox's
opinion that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Noel did not see her murderer be
correct, he could hardly have entered by the door
unless he crept softly in and stole round to the other
side of his victim, a difficult opinion to accept, as he
could hardly have done so without being seen. An
entrance by the window is even less feasible for the
same reason. Nor could the shot have been fired
through the window; the fact that the pistol, when
fired, was not more than a yard from the woman's
head puts this hypothesis at once out of the range of
probability.</p>

<p>The coroner had no other evidence than what has
been here epitomised, and the jury returned a verdict
of wilful murder against some person or persons
unknown. At the termination of the proceedings
Noel was arrested on the capital charge.</p>

<p>The examination before the magistrate was a very
tedious affair. The police had but little additional
evidence to offer and they set to work to bolster up
their case by innuendo. They put forward all the
gossip adverse to Noel's moral character they could
rake up, and a mass of tittle-tattle it proved to be.
It had no relation to the murder and did the prosecution
more harm than good.</p>

<pb n="122"/>
<p>The only fresh fact in the possession of the authorities
added to the never-ending puzzle. After Noel's
arrest the police searched the bedroom, and they
conducted the operation in a very comfortable fashion,
the inspector sitting on the bed and two constables
drinking bottled beer and smoking pipes. They
went through the contents of a chest of drawers, but
found nothing to help them. Two or three days
afterwards Noel's cousin, a <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Keane, going through
the same drawers, found a purse (which Noel thought
had been in the cash box) inside the folds of some
linen. Noel immediately wrote to the police concerning
the discovery, and their view of the matter was that
if the purse had been in the drawer when they
searched the latter they must have found it, and
consequently the purse must have been placed in
the drawer afterwards. But who placed it there
and for what purpose they did not venture to
suggest.</p>

<p>Another point the police tried to make arose out
of the condition of the cash box. The inspector
thought that the box had been broken open by a
boot and that the boot was Noel's. The official
supported his opinion by asserting that the marks
on the box corresponded with certain nails in Noel's
boots. The accuracy of this opinion was not tested,
Noel's solicitor probably thinking it was simply
dragged in to strengthen the police theory that Noel
had <q>arranged the robbery</q> in order to disguise
his crime. The chairman of the magistrates remarked
that the Bench had made up their minds about the
marks, but whether in favour of the prisoner or not
was not announced.</p>

<pb n="123"/>
<p>This was as far as the prosecution could carry the
case. The magistrates decided that there was ground
for a committal, and Noel accordingly was sent to.
stand his trial at the assizes.</p>

<p>In his charge to the grand jury, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Justice Grantham
made short work of the indictment. He declared
with much warmth that the conduct of the
police was marked by <q>impropriety, incompetence,
and illegality.</q> He denounced their attempts to
rake up Noel's past. He pointed out that the pistol
had not been found. The reason why, according to
the inspector, was that <q>he supposed it had been
put down the drain with the blood,</q> but he (<abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Justice Grantham) could not find in the evidence
that any blood had been so put down, and he did not
think any murderer would stop long enough to do
that. The police had never searched for people who
had bought pistols, and it was left for the defence
to discover that the day before the murder a pistol
had been bought and bullets of a large size corresponding
to the one which had been found. After some
scathing remarks on the searching of the house and
the bottled beer incident, his lordship wound up with
these emphatic words: <q>There is not enough evidence
in the case upon which I would like a dog to be whipped,
much less than a man to be hanged, and the case
ought not to have been sent for trial.</q></p>

<p>The result was that the grand jury were directed
to throw out the bill, as if further evidence were
found against Noel he could again be indicted, whereas
if he were declared not guilty nothing could be done.</p>

<p>And so William Noel was set free, not indeed with
the rope around his neck, but with the chance of the
<pb n="124"/>
police making another attempt to fling it about him.
Looking at the mystery in whatever way one chooses
contradictions spring up. All that can be said in
regard to Noel is that his course of action was as
puzzling as everything else. When he saw his wife
lying on the floor, why did he not climb through the
window (as he subsequently did when urged to do so
by Sanders) and go to her assistance, especially as
he knew she was <q>subject to sick bouts</q>? He
did not suspect anything serious, for <q>it did not
surprise him to see her in that position.</q> He went
instead for his next-door neighbour, and in company
with the latter looked at her a second time and still
did not do anything. Whatever may have been the
reason, he seems to have been singularly helpless.
When under suspicion he told the police an extraordinary
story to the effect that he <q>felt</q> that the
murder had been committed by his wife's sister.
But the two had not seen each other for some years
and he could furnish no reason why she should kill
her sister. All through he seems to have shown
nervousness almost to the point of hysteria, and of
course this may have accounted for his actions.</p>

<p>The police had some justification for thinking that
the robbery was <q>got up,</q> but supposing their theory
was correct, it furnished no clue to the murderer,
and their efforts to find a <q>motive</q> were futile.</p>

<head type="main"><abbr>Mr.</abbr> G. H. Storrs</head>
<head type="sub">The Riddle of Gorse Hall</head>

<p><q>Just a moment, Mary. I want to have a word
with you.</q></p>

<p>The speaker was George Henry Storrs, a rich contractor,
and the house, Gorse Hall, a lonely mansion
at the boundary line which divides Stalybridge from
Dukinfield.</p>

<p>Mary Lindley, who was the adopted daughter of
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Storrs, looked at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs in surprise,
almost in alarm. There was a strange, absorbed
look in his face which was new to her.</p>

<p>The hour was late. The girl had been to the theatre
and she did not expect to see any person but a servant.
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs had come from the dining room and had
met her in the hall.</p>

<p><q>Come in here,</q> said he, pointing to the dining
room. She followed him in trepidation.</p>

<p><q>Good heavens, father!</q> she cried, when in the
room. <q>What has happened? Who did that?</q></p>

<p>She pointed to the window. One of the panes
was shattered.</p>

<p><q>That's what I want to speak to you about. Sit
down. Your mother and I were sitting here talking
when we heard the report of a gun and the smashing
<pb n="126"/>
of glass. The shot had hit the window and then
came a man's voice shouting, <q>Hands up!</q></q></p>

<p><q>How terrible!. What did you do?</q></p>

<p><q>What <emph>could</emph> we do? The night was dark. The
shot might have struck the house by accident.</q></p>

<p><q>Who was the person threatened?</q></p>

<p><q>How can I tell? Your mother was frightfully
upset and I would not discuss the matter with her.
You know the weak state of her nerves.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, indeed. But are you sure your life was not
in danger?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't think so. Still &#x2026;</q></p>

<p><q>Have you had any trouble with any of your men?</q></p>

<p><q>No--that is, no serious trouble. Certainly there
are two men who I've sometimes thought bore me a
grudge, but I won't mention names.</q></p>

<p><q>You ought to do so, father, for your own sake.</q></p>

<p><q>No. I'll write them down if you give me your
word to keep them to yourself.</q></p>

<p>Mary Lindley promised, and she kept the slip of
paper in case it might be wanted.</p>

<p>This disturbing incident happened in the month
of September, and the sequel--if, indeed, it were a
sequel, for nothing to the point was established--came
about some six weeks later.</p>

<p>It was about nine o'clock on the 1st November.
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs, his wife, and Miss Lindley were in the
dining room; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs was playing <q>patience,</q>
one of the ladies was sewing, the other reading. The
housemaid was going in and out of the room preparing
the table for supper.</p>

<p>In the kitchen all was as usual. With no thought
of danger the cook went into the cellar for a few
<pb n="127"/>
moments, and when she returned she caught sight of a
man behind the door leading into the scullery. He
whipped out a pistol directly he saw that he was
discovered.</p>

<p><q>Not a word,</q> he threatened, <q>or I'll shoot you.</q></p>

<p>So far the procedure was not unlike that of Rush,
who murdered the Jermys at Stanfield Hall, but
unlike Rush, the Gorse Hall murderer made no attempt
at disguising himself. The cook had a good chance
of studying his features, but she was too frightened
to do anything but escape. She ran out of the kitchen
and the man followed swiftly at her heels, for when
she shut the door he was pushing it from the inside.</p>

<p>With scared face she rushed into the dining room
and screamed:</p>

<p><q>There's a man in the house!</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs immediately went into the hall and there
met the fellow. What happened between them,
whether any words passed, no one knows. Apparently,
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Storrs and Miss Lindley did not at once follow
him, but the interval was brief, and when they went
in the hall the two men were struggling violently and
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Storrs heard the intruder say:</p>

<p><q>Now I've got you!</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Storrs at once ran up the staircase, and, snatching
a shillalah hanging on the wall, hastened with it
to her husband's assistance. Then she saw that the
man had a pistol, and she was about to strike him
when he said, <q>I won't shoot,</q> and she took the
revolver from him without difficulty. Why he did
not retain the weapon was probably because he knew
it was worthless. It turned out to be a cheap revolver
of Belgian make and defective.</p>

<pb n="128"/>
<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Storrs handed the shillalah to her husband,
but it is not quite clear that he used it. His rejoinder
was to tell his wife to ring the alarm bell, and leaving
the men still struggling, she hurried up two flights of
stairs to the top of the house.</p>

<p>It may be presumed that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Storrs did ring the
bell, but we are not told definitely that such was the
fact. The lady said in her evidence before the coroner
that she was away some time and did not explain
why she did not come back. She was a difficult
witness owing to extreme nervousness, and it may
be that she was overcome by fear and was afraid to
return.</p>

<p>Miss Lindley's story was that when the cook appeared
in the dining room <q>they</q> (meaning herself and
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Storrs) held the door, but that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs opened
it and she then saw the man. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs immediately
closed with him, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Storrs tried to pull him
from her husband, and she (Miss Lindley) ran out of
the house to the Central Liberal Club for assistance.
The cook also hurried off for help. Her destination
was the coachman's cottage, but the coachman was
away. It was fifteen minutes or so before Miss
Lindley returned.</p>

<p>It is not quite certain what the housemaid did,
but this is of no importance: the point is that the
life and death struggle between <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs and his
assailant went on for several minutes, sometimes in
the hall and sometimes in the kitchen. Of this
terrible conflict for life there was not a single witness.</p>

<p>So isolated was Gorse Hall that the nearest habitation
was quite a mile away, but not far from the
entrance to the grounds was the Central Liberal
<pb n="129"/>
Club already mentioned. To the club Miss Lindley
ran for assistance, and brought back with her <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Richard Ashworth and another member of the club.
They found the front door locked, and going round
to the back of the house entered the kitchen and
discovered <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs lying on the floor in a pool of
blood. A constable arrived soon after.</p>

<p><q>I spoke to him,</q> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ashworth told the coroner,
<q>and he appeared to understand. I asked him if
there was a telephone and he said <q>no.</q> The constable
asked him who was the man who had done
the deed, and he said <q>I don't know,</q> several times.</q></p>

<p>Beyond asking for his wife this was all the dying
man said. Nothing could be got from him as to who
his assailant was or why the latter should attack him,
and in about twenty minutes he died.</p>

<p>And the murderer? He had escaped by flinging
a zinc washing bowl at the scullery window and
climbing through the aperture. At least, this was the
theory, as the bowl was found outside and the window
was broken; but why he should have taken this
trouble instead of going out by the door by which
he had entered, and which was unlocked, was one of
the many puzzles which surround the case. How
long he had been gone when the police arrived it was
impossible to say.</p>

<p>The poor man had been stabbed not once but
many times, the worst wound being at the back,
which the doctor thought must have been inflicted
by the murderer thrusting his hand under <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs's
arm and striking him from behind. To support his
theory the doctor illustrated before the judge, with
the assistance of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> James Storrs, the murdered
<pb n="130"/>
man's brother, the position of the assassin and his
victim at the time when the fatal blow was given.
The knife used appeared to have been one with a
single edge, its blade five inches long and three-quarters
of an inch broad. From the blood marks it was
evident that the struggle had swayed between the
hall and the kitchen.</p>

<p>One would have thought that this knife and the
pistol left behind would have furnished clues upon
which the police might have acted, but nothing came
of them, the fact being that the police were engaged
upon a false issue and neglected all others. Bloodhounds
were brought in to scent out the murderer's
track, but as in many other cases, they proved a
failure.</p>

<p>The murderer's motive might have been robbery
or it might have been revenge. The theory of robbery,
however, was hardly tenable and the police set to
work in another direction.</p>

<p>Then the episode of September was recalled, but
all that Miss Lindley knew was what <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs told
her. She was not certain whether or not <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs
said he suspected a man who had been discharged
from his employ. The names <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs mentioned
Miss Lindley wrote down and gave to the coroner.
They were never made public. As for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Storrs,
she was unable to throw any light on the matter.
She was so nervous she could not collect her ideas,
and her testimony, such as it was, only confused the
issue.</p>

<p>It was remarked as curious that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs should
have made a confidante of Miss Lindley rather than his
wife, but, as already stated, he was anxious not to
<pb n="131"/>
frighten her. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> James Storrs, the brother of the
murdered man, corroborated Miss Lindley's version
of the affair so far as the two names were concerned,
and on the other point said that when he asked his
brother if any discharged workman was likely to do
such a thing the answer was no.</p>

<p>The result of the disquieting incident of September
was that, to reassure his wife, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs had the alarm
bell fixed, and gave orders for the window shutters
to be closed at dusk and the kitchen door bolted.
Unfortunately, on the night of the murder the latter
order was not carried out. As for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs himself,
said his brother, he was in fear of no one and went
out and came in as usual.</p>

<p>While the police were making their enquiries, the
tragedy was deepened by the news that the coachman
in the service of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs had hanged himself. His
suicide had nothing whatever to do with the murder,
beyond the fact that the poor man's mind had become
deranged by the terrible death of his master, to whom
he was greatly attached.</p>

<p>By this time the police had been supplied with
information by the family which led them to be on
the look-out for one Cornelius Howard, a ne'er-do-well
relative of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs. The description of the murderer
given by Miss Lindley and by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Storrs and the servants
set forth that he had light blue eyes, a fair complexion,
and a slight moustache. He was wearing
dark clothes and had on a light-coloured muffler.</p>

<p>On November 15th a constable on night duty
in Oldham, noticing marks on some enclosed premises
which seemed to him suspicious, searched the place
and there found a man who corresponded with the
<pb n="132"/>
description of the murderer published in the newspapers.
The man was taken into custody and he
gave his name as John Ward, but when at the station
he admitted that he was Cornelius Howard, that he
was a pork butcher, that he had no fixed abode, and
that he had been in the Royal Field Artillery. He
was questioned as to his movements on November
1st, and in reply made this statement in writing:</p>

<p><q>On the night of November 1st I visited a
public house called the Ring o' Bells, in Huddersfield,
about 9 p.m. During that time I played the landlord
two games at dominoes for half a gallon of beer
each. There were three or four other men present
at the time, and I now wish the said landlord to be
asked if he remembers my being in the house on the
night of the 1st November, and if so, to come forward
and give evidence to that effect, and also the other
men in the house at the time. Three of the men
were navvies, and as they had spent all their money
and had not the price of their lodgings, the landlord
gave them fourpence each and sent them to their
lodgings. This was about 10.30, and I left the house
about five minutes later.</q></p>

<p>Whether this statement was true or not remained
to be seen. Meanwhile the suspicions against Howard
were strengthened by finding upon him four knives,
one of them a table knife. His left leg was cut and
scratched, and his explanation as to how he came by
these injuries was proved to be false.</p>

<p>He was picked out by Miss Lindley and by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Storrs as the man they saw; the absence of a moustache
on Howard's face being accounted for by an
Oldham hairdresser, who said that, on the morning of
<pb n="133"/>
November 2nd, he shaved off the moustache of a man
who closely resembled the prisoner.</p>

<p>In the face of such evidence it was inevitable that
Howard should be committed for trial, and accordingly
he was indicted at the Chester Assizes.</p>

<p>The crucial point was necessarily his identification,
and while <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Storrs was nervous and hesitating,
though she had no doubt Howard was the man, and
showed terror of him when she was in the box, Miss
Lindley was calm and positive that the prisoner was
the murderer. While this testimony was being given,
Howard remained quite undisturbed.</p>

<p>No further evidence was offered against Howard,
excepting proof that the explanation he had given
of the cause of his cuts and scratches was untrue.
Howard's story was that he had helped Joyce, a
lodging-house keeper, to put in a pane of glass, that
the glass had fallen and so had injured his leg. Joyce
swore that Howard had not helped him in any way
and that he knew nothing about his cuts.</p>

<p>Howard then went into the box and admitted that
his story concerning his cuts was untrue. He had
told it because he did not want the real circumstances
known. The fact was he had received them while
attempting to break into a shop in Stalybridge, the
wound being caused by falling glass. He had seen
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs some months before the  murder, but did
not speak to him as, after the death of his mother,
who was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs' relative, he considered the connection
between the two families was closed. He had
no grievance of any kind against <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs.</p>

<p>The explanation sounded feasible, but Howard's
trump card was his alibi. It was proved by three
<pb n="134"/>
witnesses that he was in the Ring o' Bells on the night
of November 1st as he had stated, and that between
8.30 and 9 he was talking to a racing man named
Thompson on the steps of the election committee
rooms at Huddersfield.</p>

<p>The only witness against the alibi was a tipsy fellow
who swore it was November 2nd, and not the 1st,
when the prisoner was in the Ring o' Bells, but as this
witness was in a too merry mood in the box, and
brought down upon him the judge's rebuke, and as
he admitted that if he could get a pint of beer every
half-hour he could last all the day, not much faith
was placed either on his memory or his word.</p>

<p>After this no one was surprised when Howard was
declared to be not guilty, and a wild cheer resounded
through the court when he stepped from the dock
a free man.</p>

<p>So the tragedy of Gorse Hall remained darker than
ever. The police abandoned their quest, and as the
assassin was not moved to confess, his name and
his motive are hardly likely to be revealed. The
story is made more puzzling by the fact that, so far
as could be discovered, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Storrs had not an enemy,
that he was on good terms with his employees, took
an active part in the various social movements
of the district, and that he was everywhere highly
respected. Why he was done to death must for
ever remain an enigma.</p>

<head type="main">Robert Kenyon and William Uttley</head>
<head type="sub">The Marston Moor Murders</head>

<p>The murder of two gamekeepers on Marston
Moor would seem to be a typical case of a
vendetta peculiar to certain types of low mentality
and strong animal passions. The trial disclosed the
hard, dour, bitter Yorkshire spirit so well portrayed
by the sisters Brontë, but it disclosed little else. The
story, however, had its dramatic points, and from
the character of the man accused of the murder one
can well understand the immense interest with which
the case was followed by people for many miles around.</p>

<p>Marston Moor is a wild, desolate tract of country
in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. Few people
other than gamekeepers and sportsmen in the grouse
season ever crossed it; indeed, it was so intersected
by gullies through which the water in the rainy months
swirled and eddied that walking, unless one knew the
paths, was dangerous.</p>

<p>The weather is never particularly inviting in the
late autumn in the Midlands, and on this 9th day of
September it was less so than usual. Fierce downpours
at intervals swept the moor now and again,
ceasing as suddenly as they had begun. Then the
<pb n="136"/>
sky cleared and for a brief space the moor lost its
cheerless aspect.</p>

<p>It was during one of these brief spaces--about half-past
three in the afternoon--that a couple of gamekeepers
climbed some rising ground, and arriving at
the summit cast their eyes around on the look-out for
poachers.</p>

<p>One of these gamekeepers was elderly, with a rugged
weather-beaten face, James Kenyon by name. The
other was his son Bob, not much more than a stripling
despite his twenty-two years and his service in the
army.</p>

<p>When on the top of the eminence, James Kenyon,
shading his eyes with his hand, glanced about him.
He was long sighted, as he had need to be, and the
cessation of the rain enabled him to see a considerable
distance. On this fact much subsequently depended.</p>

<p><q>See yon man, Bob?</q> he exclaimed all at once.</p>

<p><q>Aye. Who be he?</q></p>

<p><q><emph>I</emph> know, an' he's after no good.</q></p>

<p><q>How can you tell who he be? Why, he be pretty
nigh a mile away--three-quarters anyway.</q></p>

<p><q>Maybe. I know him all the same by his walk
an' the way he carries his gun. You get away after
him, Bob. Leave your gun wi' me. You'll be able
to walk quicker wi'out it. I'll fire my gun to let you
know where I am if you're not back soon.</q></p>

<p>Robert Kenyon started, and his father watched him
until he was lost to sight. He could see until they
disappeared that the man his son was stalking was
about a mile in front. Over an hour passing and
Robert not returning, the old man fired his gun but
there was no response, and after putting a mark on
<pb n="137"/>
the under side of a stone near a workman's cabin to
indicate to his son that he had gone home (it was an
old arrangement of theirs) James Kenyon went back
to his house.</p>

<p>The evening wore on, and Robert not making his
appearance his father determined to look for him, and
going to the cabin found that the stone had not been
turned. Throughout the night he went to and from
his house walking about the moor, sometimes shouting
<q>Bob,</q> but without result.</p>

<p>During one of these fruitless visits to the Moor a
curious thing happened. It was about half-past nine,
and the moon was shining, when, reaching the spot
where he had parted from his son, he saw, so he
declared, the <q>white face</q> of a man in the same
place where he had previously seen the man whom
he thought he knew, and after whom he had sent
his son. He could not distinguish the features and
he had no means of testing him by his walk
because, to use James Kenyon's words, <q>he would
not stand up.</q> It subsequently appeared that
Kenyon was very uncertain whether, in spite of the
<q>walk,</q> he had positively recognised this man or
not on the first occasion. He certainly was somewhat
hazy on the point.</p>

<p>The old man's memory was also defective on another
matter and one of considerable importance. It appears
that about half-past three, but whether before or after
his son left him was not stated, he met a man named
Shaw and spoke to him. This little fact he kept to
himself and it was only dragged from him after a considerable
interval. The omission was all the more
significant because Shaw swore positively that the
<pb n="138"/>
man seen in the distance was not he whom Kenyon
thought it was, and Shaw knew him well.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kenyon's neighbours began to interest
themselves in the matter, especially as it was rumoured
that another keeper named William Uttley was also
missing. It was then resolved that two parties should
search the moor.</p>

<p>James Kenyon was at the head of one of these
parties, and while going along by a <q>gruff,</q> or gully,
they came upon a startling sight--the body of Uttley
lying at the bottom. He was dead. He had been
shot in the head and was lying face downwards. His
stick was close by and his dog was watching the body.</p>

<p><q>I saw footprints up to the body,</q> said old Kenyon,
describing the scene. <q>Then they went back and
was lost sight of.</q></p>

<p>Meanwhile, about 100 yards or so away, the second
party had come upon puzzling marks on the grass by
the side of a deep gully. The appearance of the
grass suggested that something had been dragged
along, but the searchers could see nothing more, and
were passing on when they were stayed by a man
named Sykes, who had his doubts.</p>

<p><q>I feel sure Robert's somewhere near,</q> said he.
<q>Let's turn back.</q></p>

<p>They did so and, coming to a heap of stones at the
bottom of the gully, Sykes uttered an exclamation
of horror. He had caught sight of a pair of clogs
protruding from the heap!</p>

<p>The stones were hastily removed and the worst
forebodings of the workers were verified. Beneath
the heap was found the body of Robert Kenyon.
He had been shot through the spine and, like William
<pb n="139"/>
Uttley, with a grouse gun. The murderer had in each
instance stealthily approached his victim from the
side, and had shot Kenyon within a distance of three
yards and Uttley at about nine yards.</p>

<p>The marks on the grass were now explained. The
body of Robert Kenyon had been dragged from the
place where he was killed, but where this spot was
could not be decided. Nor was it clear why his feet
had been left uncovered--presumably the murderer
was in a hurry to get away and did his work of concealment
hurriedly. If so, the deed must have been
done in the dark. This was against the police theory
that the murder had taken place in the afternoon
between the hours of four and six o'clock.</p>

<p>Apparently it was a motiveless crime. Robert
Kenyon had no enemies, and though William Uttley
carried out his duties strictly he was known to be a
just man.</p>

<p>James Kenyon certainly was unable to throw any
light upon Uttley's death, but he had his suspicions
in regard to that of his son. He was sure that the
murderer was the man whom he saw nearly a mile
away and whom he believed was somebody he knew.</p>

<p><q>I won't ask you to say who this man was,</q> said
the coroner, <q>but you may write it down.</q></p>

<p>The crowded court looked on with breathless interest
while the old man laboriously moved the pen over
the paper which he folded up and handed to the
coroner. For days the curiosity of the public was
on tenterhooks, and great was the sensation when it
was known that Henry Buckley, a well-known and
respected religious worker, a staunch supporter of
the local Salvation Army, and the President of an
<pb n="140"/>
Oldham temperance league, had been arrested. The
secret of the folded paper was out. The name written
upon it was <q>Henry Buckley.</q></p>

<p>Beyond James Kenyon's belief or certainty (as
already pointed out, sometimes it was one, sometimes
it was the other), what was the evidence connecting
Buckley with the murder? His statement, made
the day after the murder and some days before his
arrest to a police constable who most improperly
questioned him without any warning, was this:</p>

<p><q>Henry Buckley</q> (wrote the constable), <q>Sholver
Farm, Oldham, says that on Wednesday (the 9th of
September, the day of the murder) I was on Friarmere
after dinner. I sat under the wall until about 3 p.m.
I shot at a bird but could not find it. It started
raining. I was sitting under the wall and looking
for the bird for about an hour. I saw two men on
the moor about 3.15 or 3.20.&#x2026; My wife and son
Richard came up with my pony cart about 4 p.m.
and then drove home. I went out about 5 a.m. this
morning (the 10th), came back without a bird. Shot
for about an hour.</q></p>

<p>The constable told Buckley that he probably would
be required at the inquest as a witness, whereupon
Buckley exclaimed (naturally enough), <q>You've made
me feel very queer.</q></p>

<p>The police set all their ingenuity to work to show
that Buckley's statement as to the time he returned
home was untrue, and that the hour was really 6.30.
It was against their case that each of the two witnesses
they brought forward for this purpose should have
had a grudge against Buckley, while the evidence of
a third was entirely negative. The prosecution also
<pb n="141"/>
laid stress on the fact that when Buckley was seen
in his cart he was crouching down at the back with a
coat thrown over his shoulders, and his son was
driving. If the inference was that Buckley was
trying to conceal himself, it can hardly be accepted,
as the simple explanation was that it was raining at
the time, and as his wife and son were occupying the
only seat there was no place for him other than the
back of the cart.</p>

<p>On the other hand, two witnesses were produced
by the defence who saw Buckley in his house a little
before six; it was also proved that he was in the
Temperance Hall at Oldham at a few minutes before
seven. This would have been impossible had he
only reached home at 6.30.</p>

<p>A week after the murder a puzzling discovery was
made in the shape of Robert Kenyon's watch, which
was found on the moor wrapped in a red cotton handkerchief.
No reason could be furnished why the
watch had been hidden, while from the comparatively
clean condition of the handkerchief it was fair to assume
that it had been deposited some time after the murder,
as there had been heavy rains in the interval. It
was a moot point whether the watch had been so
placed with the object of being found, or the reverse.
It was partly covered with earth, and the man who
saw a corner of the handkerchief peeping out thought
the object of burying was concealment, and that the
clod of earth had been <choice><reg>accidentally</reg><orig>accidently</orig></choice> disturbed and so
disclosed what was beneath.</p>

<p>The handkerchief itself was part of the puzzle.
Old Kenyon said he knew nothing about it, nor had
he ever seen his son with such a handkerchief. The
<pb n="142"/>
police do not appear to have troubled about it, yet
it should have been followed up as a possible clue.</p>

<p>More direct evidence against Buckley was the
presence in his house of wads and cartridges similar,
so it was alleged, to those used by the murderer, and
on this point a stiff battle subsequently arose between
the prosecution and the defence at the examination
of Buckley before the magistrates.</p>

<p>The animosity of James Kenyon against Buckley
was manifest when the latter was placed in the dock.
The dour old gamekeeper shifted his stick from his
right to his left hand, clenched his right fist, and shook
it at the accused man. There was, it appeared, no
love lost between the two. Both had hasty tempers,
and they had had hot words when on one occasion
Kenyon sought to charge Buckley with shooting over
the boundary which separated Friarmere from Marston
Moor.</p>

<p>Putting on one side the dispute as to how long
Buckley was on the moor and the question of his
alleged identity with the man seen by James Kenyon,
the crucial point to determine was whether the murderer
had used black or smokeless powder. Buckley
used black powder for his grouse shooting, and both
Kenyon and Uttley were killed at such a short range
that marks ought to have been apparent on their
bodies had black powder been employed. To settle
the matter the Home Secretary ordered the exhumation
of the bodies.</p>

<p>This was done, but again there was uncertainty.
The doctors differed. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Aspinal could find no black
marks round the wound, and he <q>held a positive
opinion</q> that the murderer had not used black powder.
<pb n="143"/>
<abbr>Dr.</abbr> Irving, on the contrary, saw marks on Uttley's
neck and shoulder which looked like grains of black
powder.</p>

<p>Sympathy was wholly with Buckley, and a burst
of applause greeted his advocate when he sat down
after delivering one of the most convincing and
impassioned addresses ever heard in a police court
The Bench were an hour in making up their minds,
and when they returned and the chairman announced
that <q>The Bench are of opinion that the evidence
adduced does not justify us in committing this man,</q>
cheers which the police could not repress rang through
the court, and the excitement was renewed when
one of the magistrates stepped from the Bench and
shook the prisoner's hand warmly.</p>

<p>The mystery of Marston Moor has never been solved,
and probably never will be.</p>

<div n="4.9" xml:id="campden" type="section">
<pb n="144"/>
<head type="main">The Campden Wonder</head>

<p>The story of what is called the <q>Campden Wonder</q>
is wholly inexplicable. Though it can
hardly be classed exactly as a motiveless <q>murder,</q>
the story from beginning to end is motiveless and it
must for ever remain one of the most extraordinary
in the annals of crime.</p>

<p>Chipping Campden, a quiet little market town,
lies at the foot of the Cotswold Hills. When the
drama now about to be unfolded was enacted, it consisted
simply of a straggling street of low gabled houses,
with an ancient market house in the centre.</p>

<p>The chief mansion in the locality is Campden
House. At the breaking-out of the Revolution of
1641 it was a stately pile, but its owner in those
days, Baptist, Lord Noel, belonged to the party of
the Cavaliers, and he burnt the mansion to prevent
it falling into the hands of the Roundheads. A
portion was rebuilt when tranquillity was restored,
and Lady Campden took up her residence there.</p>

<p>The steward of Campden House was a staid elderly
man of grave demeanour and regular habits, by name
William Harrison. No one less erratic or further
removed from sentiment and romance could be
imagined. He was happily married, and had one
son, a youth about nineteen.</p>

<pb n="145"/>
<p>One afternoon he took his hat and stick and set
out to collect certain rents for her ladyship. His
destination, so he told his wife, was Charingworth,
and he expected to be back about five o'clock. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Harrison was to wait tea for him.</p>

<p>Five--six--seven came, and his wife sat watching
the clock with increasing uneasiness. Her husband,
the most punctual of men, had not returned.</p>

<p>At last she could control her anxiety no longer,
and to ease her mind went in search of a man-servant,
John Perry. She found Perry in the stables and
asked if he knew of anything that might detain his
master.</p>

<p><q>That I don't, mistress,</q> said Perry, <q>but if so be
as you like, I'll go to Charingworth and see what's
become of him.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Harrison was doubtful. Her husband's absence
was exceedingly strange, but there might be a reasonable
explanation, and if she made a fuss unnecessarily
he might not like it.</p>

<p><q>I'll wait another hour, John,</q> said she.</p>

<p>The hour passed slowly, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harrison not
returning, she despatched Perry to Charingworth.
This step, instead of easing her doubts, only increased
her alarm, for midnight came and then the small
hours, and nothing was seen of Perry.</p>

<p>She could bear the suspense no longer. It was
clear to her agitated mind that some catastrophe
had happened at Charingworth. She now sent her
son, Edward.</p>

<p>When the lad reached Charingworth it was five
o'clock in the morning, and here he met Perry, who
said he had been enquiring in all directions for news
<pb n="146"/>
of the missing man, but all he had discovered was
that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harrison had mentioned to the people of
a farmhouse, where he had called, that he was coming
home by way of Ebrington, a village lying between
Charingworth and Campden.</p>

<p>Edward Harrison was rather a sharp lad, and he
asked Perry if he knew the hour at which his father
had called at this farmhouse.</p>

<p><q>About seven o'clock, I were told.</q></p>

<p><q>That's strange,</q> replied the youth, <q>seeing he
said he was coming home at five. Father isn't one
to put himself out for anybody.</q></p>

<p>Perry could suggest no explanation, and he and
young Harrison set out for Ebrington.</p>

<p>Here they came upon a little more information.
Harrison had certainly been at Ebrington, for he had
called at the house of a man named Daniel, and then
started to return to Campden.</p>

<p>Here all trace of the missing man ceased, and
wearied and sick at heart, Edward Harrison returned
to his anxious mother.</p>

<p>Days of distress followed. Search parties were
organised, and their efforts resulted in a discovery
which seemed to point to only one conclusion--foul
play. In a furze bush near a wood lying between
Ebrington and Campden was found a hat cut and
battered, and a neckband stained with blood.
They were identified as having been worn by
William Harrison on the night of his disappearance.</p>

<p>But if he had been robbed and murdered, what
had become of his body? The most rigorous examination
of every possible place of concealment failed
<pb n="147"/>
to reveal anything. Thickets were probed, the tall
bracken was trodden down, ponds were dragged, but
with no result.</p>

<p>In the meantime gossip and conjectures were active,
and the question began to be asked, Why had Perry
remained absent for something like seven or eight
hours? When he failed to get information at Charingworth,
why didn't he return at once and report his
non-success to his mistress?</p>

<p>Popular opinion became so excited that the authorities
had no alternative but to arrest John Perry and
take him before a magistrate.</p>

<p>Up to this time Perry had been reticent, but feeling
himself in an awkward position, he gave an account
of his proceedings.</p>

<p>His story was that on his way to Charingworth he
met a man of the name of Reed, and feeling afraid to
go on in the dark he returned to Campden. After
a little while he made another start for Charingworth
in company with another man, but after going a little
way again returned.</p>

<p>Then he went into a hen roost, where he remained
till twelve o'clock, when, the moon having risen, he
took courage and again set out; but a mist rising, he
lost his way and lay under a hedge till morning,
when he went on to Charingworth and enquired for
his master of one Edward Plaister, who told him he
had paid <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harrison £23 the night previous. He
made further enquiries without success, and on his
return home, about five o'clock in the morning, met
his master's son.</p>

<p>This account, somewhat rambling to say the least,
was confirmed by the two men Perry mentioned, but
<pb n="148"/>
the story was not considered satisfactory and he was
detained in custody.</p>

<p>A week went over and then came a startling announcement.
Perry asked to be taken before the magistrate,
to whom he would disclose what he would tell
to no one else.</p>

<p><q>What have you got to say?</q> asked the magistrate.</p>

<p><q>I've got to say this, that my master was murdered--but
not by me,</q> answered the man, slowly.</p>

<p><q>By whom, then? If you know, you are bound
to tell.</q></p>

<p><q>My master was murdered by my brother and my
mother!</q> said he, without showing the least emotion.</p>

<p>He went on to say that, ever since he had been in
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harrison's service, his mother and brother had been
urging him to join them in robbing his master. At
last he consented, and the scheme was to waylay
Harrison on his return from receiving the rents.</p>

<p>When the steward started for Charingworth Perry
sent word to his brother, and they met that evening
soon after he had been sent by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Harrison to
search for her husband.</p>

<p>They shadowed the old man continually until he
was on his way home, when they saw him go into a
field called the Conygree, through which a private
path, which he was in the habit of using, led to his
house.</p>

<p>Then John Perry's heart failed him.</p>

<p><q>Dick,</q> said he to his brother, <q>if you like to
finish the job by yourself, you can have all the old
chap's money. While you do it I'll take a walk in the
fields.</q></p>

<pb n="149"/>
<p>He was away some minutes, and when he returned
he found his master on the ground in the middle of
the field, his brother upon him and his mother standing
by.</p>

<p>His master was not then dead and he moaned out:</p>

<p><q>Would you kill me?</q></p>

<p>John Perry begged his brother not to murder the
old man, but Richard replied harshly, <q>Shut up,
you're a fool!</q> and thereupon strangled him.</p>

<p>After this Richard took a bag of money out of his
master's pocket and threw it in his mother's lap, and
they then carried the body into the garden, intending
to throw it into a large hole. While they were in the
garden he left them to watch and listen, and he
believed his mother and brother put the body into a
hole, but whether they did so he could not say.</p>

<p>He then returned to the hen roost, and taking his
master's hat and neckband cut them with his knife
and threw them in the road where they were found.</p>

<p>Of course, after this no one could doubt what had
happened, and everybody was ready to say, <q>I told
you so.</q> It only remained now to find the body to
clear up everything. But in the most aggravating
way Harrison's body persisted in remaining invisible.
Every place mentioned by Perry was searched
thoroughly, the spot where the murdered man was
supposed to be buried was dug up, and still nothing
was discovered.</p>

<p>But no one questioned the murder, and on the
strength of John Perry's confession, his mother and
brother were arrested. They loudly swore they were
innocent, John as loudly protested they were guilty.
Public excitement rose to fever heat.</p>

<pb n="150"/>
<p>Amid all the puzzle only one thing could be said
with positive certainty, and that was John Perry's
fixed determination to make the guilt of his mother
and brother as black as possible. While the three
were being taken from the magistrate's to the gaol
he had an opportunity of strengthening his accusation.</p>

<p>John was walking on in front between two constables,
and Richard was some twenty paces behind. Pulling
his handkerchief from his pocket Richard dropped
a roll of black tape.</p>

<p><q>What's this?</q> asked the constable who was
walking with them.</p>

<p><q>It's nothing,</q> replied Richard, <q>only a tape my
wife does her hair with.</q></p>

<p>The constable took the black tape and asked John
if he knew anything about it.</p>

<p>Now John, walking in front of his brother, had not
seen the tape fall and did not know where it came
from; and directly he saw it he said:</p>

<p><q>Yes, to my sorrow. That's what my brother
strangled my master with.</q></p>

<p>Of course, this increased the belief in the guilt of
the Perrys. There seemed to be no limit to John
Perry's confessions. Some time before the disappearance
of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harrison his house was broken into and
£140 stolen. Perry then declared that on the occasion
of the burglary he was attacked by the fellows, who
threatened to kill him. He now declared that the
attack upon him was a fiction. The real robber was
his brother, and he had invented the story to make
Harrison think the burglars were strangers.</p>

<p>Although the body of the missing man was not
found, and although there was not a particle of evidence
<pb n="151"/>
beyond the confession of John Perry, the three
prisoners were tried, found guilty and sentenced to be
hanged.</p>

<p>The scene on the scaffold was a terribly painful
one. The mother, Joan Perry, was executed first,
because it was believed she had influenced her sons.
When it came to Richard's turn he bitterly reproached
his brother, and begged him to tell the truth, for he
(Richard) was perfectly innocent.</p>

<p>The only reply of John Perry was a brutal grunt,
and his face became more sullen than ever. With
dogged courage the alleged murderer went to his
doom.</p>

<p>Now came the most extraordinary part of the story.
Some few years afterwards, who should appear on the
scene but William Harrison himself!</p>

<p>He had not been murdered, and he knew nothing
of the unaccountable confession of John Perry. His
story was that, after collecting the rents from the
various tenants, he was set upon by three men and
knocked senseless. When he came to himself he
found that he was bound with a rope and was in a
cart in a part of the country which was quite strange
to him.</p>

<p>He was taken, he believed, to Deal, and there put
on shipboard. In the Mediterranean the ship
was boarded by a crew of a Turkish vessel, and he
was landed on the Levantine coast, where he was
forced into the employ of a Turkish pasha, and only
succeeded in making his escape after enduring terrible
privations.</p>

<p>Such was William Harrison's account of his absence.
It is almost as incredible as John Perry's extraordinary
<pb n="152"/>
accusation. However, whether Harrison spoke the
truth or not, unquestionably he was not murdered.</p>

<p>The only reasonable explanation of John Perry's
charging his mother and brother with the murder is
that he was under some delusion and that his brain
was affected. But whichever way the story is looked
at, it must be regarded as most remarkable, and
rather belonging to fiction than fact. Yet fact it is.</p>

<div n="5" xml:id="burdell" type="chapter">

<pb n="153"/>
<head type="main"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Harvey Burdell</head>
<head type="sub">A New York Puzzle</head>

<p>The murder of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Harvey Burdell resembles in
many of its aspects that of Benjamin Nathan.
The two were equally barbarous, the intent of the
assassin or assassins was deadly and merciless, both
men were swiftly done to death in their own rooms
in the dead of night; Benjamin Nathan had no time
to utter the faintest cry, Harvey Burdell's life was cut
off in the midst of a word, one half of which alone
escaped his lips; in each case there was not the slightest
sign that the murderer had broken into the house.
Suspicion, it is true, rested upon certain of the inmates,
but if that suspicion was justified, the demeanour of
the suspected persons, and the undisturbed coolness
with which they underwent a trying examination,
baffled all attempts to fix the crime upon any one
person.</p>

<p>Of the two murders, Benjamin Nathan's was the
most difficult to solve. Robbery was alleged, but
the murder was apparently without a motive. This
can hardly be said as regards Harvey Burdell's. The
crime in his case possessed more features appealing
to human interest. There was romance--perhaps
not of a very elevated kind, but romance, notwithstanding--there
was intrigue, there was a mercenary
<pb n="154"/>
instinct, and last and most important of all, a woman,
handsome and fascinating, loomed largely in the
involved threads which the law failed to disentangle.
The story, indeed, has all the materials ready to the
hand of a writer of sensational fiction, and the wonder
is that these materials have not been so utilized.
But perhaps fictionists felt that the narrative, so much
of it as became public, could not be bettered.</p>

<p>On the night of January 29th, 1857, at about
a quarter to eleven, a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ross, walking along Bond
Street, New York, saw in front of him, at 150 feet
distance or so, a tall, stout, well-built man with a
shawl about his shoulders. The man stopped at <abbr>No.</abbr>
31, opened the door with his latchkey, and went
inside. <q>When I got about a house and a half or
two houses on I heard the cry of <q>Murd--</q> short like
that, the word wasn't finished,</q> said Ross afterwards.</p>

<p>About the same time a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Strangman was in Bond
Street near <abbr>No.</abbr> 31, but on the opposite side of the
way. <q>I heard a sharp, stifled cry &#x2026; the cry was
loud and like that of a person in agony; it was a sort
of a shrill cry,</q> so he described it. <q>I looked up and
down Bond Street at the time and saw no person in
the street.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Brooks, living at 36 Bond Street, nearly
opposite <abbr>No.</abbr> 31, also heard the sound. <q>The first
syllable <emph>Mur</emph> was distinct but the <emph>der</emph> was prolonged
and guttural,</q> he declared. <q>I was going to bed.&#x2026;
I instantly sprang on a chest of drawers and through
the venetian blinds which were shut I could distinctly
see this house (<abbr>No.</abbr> 31) &#x2026; the night being very still,
I thought I heard a noise as of shuffling on a floor.&#x2026;
<pb n="155"/>
I looked up the street in order to see if garotters were
around; I saw nothing further.</q></p>

<p>A man named Farrell was in Bond Street between
ten and eleven o'clock, and coming to <abbr>No.</abbr> 31, he sat
down on the doorstep to lace up his shoe. While he
was doing this two men approached him, one of whom
came on to the step, the other passing on. <q>In a half
minute or so after the man went into the house I
heard a cry of murder; I said to myself there's a muss
in this house.</q> Farrell's idea was there had been
too much drinking. <q>In probably a minute,</q> Farrell
went on to say, <q>I heard the retreating step of the
man who had gone in; when the noise was over I
heard a door open; after the cry I heard a noise of a
shaking as if something solid like a barrel had been
turned down. In half a minute a man came to the
door and opened it. I looked up and he said, <q>What
are you doing there?</q> The man was in his shirt
sleeves. I thought he had been sent by the man
who first went in to turn me off the step, and I took
my shoe in my hand to three or four doors off. The
man who went into the house had a shawl on. The
sound I heard was like that of someone choking.</q></p>

<p>The statements of these four men may be likened
to a prologue to a drama, in this case one of the most
perplexing and involved to be found in the annals
of murder. The mystery might have been straightened
out had it been in the hands of a competent coroner,
but the official to whom was entrusted its investigation--called
by the <title>New York Tribune</title> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coroner
Dogberry, and not without cause--was a fussy dogmatic
person, who did not seem to be able to distinguish
between what was important evidence and what was
<pb n="156"/>
not. He summoned a crowd of witnesses who had
nothing to say that was material, and detained in
custody, apparently on the whim of the moment,
witnesses who had not the least intention of absenting
themselves, witnesses whom at the instance of a
higher court he had to release. The result was the
accumulation of an overwhelming mass of so-called
evidence through which one has to toil painfully in
the task of sifting the wheat from the chaff. To
make matters worse, it was the habit of the American
reporter of the day to take down every word, even
to the veriest trivialities, and during the coroner's
enquiry some 150 columns in the smallest type available
appeared in the <title>Tribune</title>. A quarter of this
would have sufficed.</p>

<p>From the outset one is faced by a multitude of
discrepancies, irrelevancies and speculations which
serve no purpose, and only produce upon the mind
a feeling of hopeless confusion. Confusion in the
Burdell case went far beyond the Nathan affair, bad
as that was. In what we have termed the prologue
we have four witnesses who speak to the same thing,
but in a manner which suggests that their statements
were as much imaginative as truthful. At the very
moment Ross, after seeing the shawled man go into
<abbr>No.</abbr> 31, heard the first syllable of, the word <q>murder,</q>
Strangman was in Bond Street and heard the cry too,
but he declares that he saw no person in the street.
Brookes, living opposite, heard the whole of the word
and other sounds, but saw nothing. Yet all this
time Farrell was seated on the steps of <abbr>No.</abbr> 31; the
shawled man had to pass him in order to enter the
house, and the door was opened within a minute or
<pb n="157"/>
so and Farrell told to move off. All this passed
unnoticed by the others. What is still more extraordinary
is that four persons should hear the cry of
<q>murder</q> and do nothing. The impulse, surely,
should have been to inform the police, but not one
seems to have cared, and so the thing was allowed
to drift.</p>

<p>At <abbr>No.</abbr> 31 lived <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Harvey Burdell, a surgeon
dentist, a man some forty-six years old, portly, robust,
and with a reputation which bespoke him a free liver,
especially as regards women. The testimony of a
dentist who knew him intimately was that he was
a mercenary, selfish man of strong passions. He
was easily excited, but was not a man who would
be likely to attack another; he would cool down if
a person spoke sharply to him. All the same he
quarrelled with everyone with whom he came in
contact; he quarrelled with his partners, he quarrelled
with all his relatives and had law suits with most of
them.</p>

<p>He was the owner of <abbr>No.</abbr> 31 Bond Street, and
keeping one room for his own use he let out the rest,
and the characters of some of the occupants were
said to be somewhat questionable. He used his
room for dentistry purposes and slept there on a sofa,
getting his meals in cheap restaurants. In his employment
was a rather remarkable Irish servant girl, whom
he treated more like a dog than a human being. He
did not provide her with a bed or anything to sleep
upon. He paid her a small salary on which she
supported herself as best she could. Besides English
she could speak French, German, Spanish, and had
a great passion for studying and learning languages.
<pb n="158"/>
She slept sitting on a stool in the kitchen below the
hall door, so if any person rang the bell or entered the
house at any time of night, she would know it and attend
them. This Irish prodigy appears to have been the
discovery of one of the <title>Tribune's</title> energetic reporters.
She does not figure in the inquest, as from the fact
that she was on duty all night she surely should have
done, and most likely she belonged to one of <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Burdell's former abodes, though it is not so precisely
stated; maybe she was not at Bond Street at all.</p>

<p>In view of what happened on the night of Friday,
January 30th, it is of the first importance to know
who besides <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell lived in the house. There
were <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham, a handsome widow with two
daughters, a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> John L. Eckel, generally supposed
to be paying court to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham, a young man
of eighteen named Snodgrass who was extremely
attentive to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham's daughters, Helen
and Augusta, the <abbr>Hon.</abbr> Daniel Ulman, and Hannah
Coulan, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham's cook. Burdell's Irish
servant we may discard as non-existent.</p>

<p>We take up the thread of the narrative somewhere
about eight o'clock on Saturday morning. John
Burchell, an errand boy employed at <abbr>No.</abbr> 31 Bond
Street, went, as was his custom, to carry coals and
make up fires, and left a scuttle of coals at <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell's
door. The door was closed and the key outside, an
unusual thing, said the boy. Later on he went into
the doctor's room to ask for instructions concerning
the duties of the day, and caught sight of blood on
the wall and on the cupboard door. He went a step
or two further and saw his master lying face downward
on the floor in the midst of a pool of blood.
<pb n="159"/>
Terribly frightened, the lad ran away, told Hannah
the cook what he had seen, and the two rushed upstairs
to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham began to
cry and the boy was sent by Snodgrass to fetch assistance.
By this time it was established that the doctor
was dead.</p>

<p>Medical examination showed signs of strangulation.
In addition, there were fifteen incised wounds on the
body, chiefly about the neck and chest, the weapon
in one instance having been used with such force that
the heart was penetrated. All the wounds, declared
the surgeon, appeared to have been inflicted with the
same instrument, probably eight inches long, sharp-pointed,
and about three-quarters of an inch in breadth.</p>

<p>There were no indications of robbery, no signs of
the house having been broken into, no evidence that
any outside person bore <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell a grudge sufficiently
bitter to suggest murder; the conclusion
arrived at was that the assassin was someone residing
within the house. The conduct of the inquest,
indeed, was directed towards this end; from the very
beginning the coroner made up his mind in regard
to certain of the inmates. This bias led him to dig
up everything bearing upon their antecedents, and
to the introduction of a huge mass of irrelevant matter,
the only effect of which was to obscure the real issue.</p>

<p>The movements of the occupants on the night in
question appear to have been as follows: About
ten o'clock <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham sent her servant to bed
and some time between ten and eleven retired herself,
as did the others, with the exception of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ulman.
The servant and two little boys slept in one attic,
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Snodgrass in another on the fourth floor, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
<pb n="160"/>
Cunningham and her daughters occupied a room on
the third floor, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Eckel another room on the same
floor, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ulman in a third room also on this
floor. None of these persons, according to their
evidence, was disturbed during the night of the
murder by any unusual noise or cry.</p>

<p>By the time the murder was discovered on the
following morning, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham, her daughters,
and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Snodgrass had breakfasted. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Eckel on
that morning, left the house before breakfast to fulfil
a business engagement, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ulman, who did not
board in the house, had not risen. He had come
home the night before at half-past twelve, and he
asserted he had heard no noise. Accepting the evidence
of Ross, Strangman, Brooks and Farrell, already
alluded to, the time the murder was committed is
fixed at a quarter to eleven, and this was borne out
by the coldness and rigidity of the corpse and the
dryness of the blood with which its clothes had been
saturated. Taking this important fact as established,
the question naturally arises how came it that none
of the inmates, who could only have just gone to bed
at the moment of the murder, did not hear the cry
which was so audible to four persons outside the house?
The testimony of the occupants, however, remained
unshaken and the matter must remain as it is.</p>

<p>The investigation into the mystery of the murder
had not proceeded more than a few hours when the
affair took a startling turn. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham declared
that, on the evening of the 28th of October of
the previous year, she had been secretly married to <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Burdell by the <abbr>Rev.</abbr> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Marvine, her eldest daughter
being one witness and the clergyman's maidservant
<pb n="161"/>
another, the marriage taking place at the house of
the clergyman who performed the ceremony. Like
every circumstance of this most extraordinary case,
the story of the secret marriage was clouded by
doubt. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Marvine, who was called before the coroner,
had no hesitation in identifying Mrs. Cunningham
as the woman he had married, but was unable to
identify the corpse of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell as that of the
husband, although either at the time of the marriage
or on the following day when the latter came to him
for the marriage certificate his attention had been
attracted by the peculiar appearance of the man's
whiskers, which led him to think that they were false.
The clergyman's maidservant also could not identify
the dead body as that of the man whose marriage
she had witnessed.</p>

<p>The further this matter was probed the more puzzling
did it become. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham's two maidservants
stated, among other points, that <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell for some
time preceding the alleged marriage took his meals
in the house which the lady occupied in part, as already
mentioned, but from the date of the marriage he had
not only discontinued doing so, but had refused to eat
articles of food and beverages which she had sent to
him from her table; he had not occupied the same
sleeping apartments and had not appeared to regard
or treat her as his wife. One of the servants went
further than this, and made assertions as to an intimate
association between <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham and Eckel.</p>

<p>Eckel was said to have formerly been a butcher,
and at the time of the murder was a dealer in hides
and tallow in a somewhat extensive way of business,
as he had three stores. A mystery attaches to Eckel
<pb n="162"/>
which was not elucidated. He was completely bald
and he had a fancy for wearing wigs of different colours
which completely changed his appearance. The purpose
of this eccentricity was not revealed, but it may
have had some relation to the secret marriage, as will
be seen later on. The <abbr>Rev.</abbr> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Marvine's inability to
recognise <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell as the man whom he married
to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham and his remark that he fancied
the man's whiskers were false are certainly suggestive.
However this may be, Eckel was undoubtedly on
very intimate terms with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham, but all
the ingenuity and redundancy of the coroner could
not connect him with the death of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell. Yet,
if the evidence of Farrell is to be depended upon,
suspicion, indirectly, rested upon Eckel. This evidence
is entitled to consideration.</p>

<p>Now from the second-story room door, where the
murder was committed, down to the street door, were
slight marks of fresh blood, in addition to marks upon
the inside knob and upon the edge of the street door,
at a height of about four feet from the floor. There
was no blood on the outside door knob, the inference
being that the murderer, while his hands were bloody,
did not leave the house and close the door behind
him. Farrell, it will be recalled, said that a man,
whom he subsequently identified as Eckel, came to
the door a few seconds after he (Farrell) heard the
sounds which resembled choking, followed by a fall
like that of a barrel. This man, Farrell said further,
holding the door with his right hand on the inner
knob and his left on the edge of the door, put his
head out and, perceiving Farrell sitting on the steps,
ordered him away fiercely and forcibly. The
<pb n="163"/>
important point in connection with the murder is that
Eckel's hands, as described by Farrell, were just
where the marks of blood were found. Farrell was
severely cross-examined, but his testimony was not
shaken, though doubt was thrown upon his story by
what Brookes, Strangman and Ross told a reporter.
In passing, it may be remarked that the reporters
of the various New York papers vied with the coroner
in raking up evidence, no matter from what source,
and embellishing it with their own comments, thereby
adding to the mountain of material for the bewildered
readers to wade through. It is, however, interesting
to put what Brookes, Strangman and Ross said
against Farrell's statement.</p>

<p>Ross's version of what happened is that when he
saw <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell enter his house he (Ross) was at a
distance of some twenty-five feet away, and that when
he passed the door after Burdell had gone inside
Farrell was not sitting on the steps, and that he had
gone but forty feet or so on his way when he heard
the cry of murder, then he turned and looked towards
the house but did not see Farrell sitting on the steps.
If this be true as to distance, the presumption is that
while Ross was walking sixty-five feet or so, <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Burdell may have gone from the street door upstairs,
reached his rooms, have been attacked and then
uttered the cry of murder.</p>

<p>The question confronts us, Could all this have taken
place in so short a space of time? The average man
would easily walk sixty-five feet in less than a minute,
yet the evidence went to show that Burdell went
upstairs to the back room on the second story, took
off his overshoes, laid aside his shawl and hat, sat
<pb n="164"/>
down at his desk, and while sitting was stabbed. It
hardly seems possible, and the only explanation is
that Ross was mistaken in his estimate of the distances,
and if so, he might have been mistaken in regard to
Farrell.</p>

<p>What Strangman told the same reporter somewhat
supports the hypothesis that Ross was in error.
Strangman said he was several houses past <abbr>No.</abbr> 31
when he heard the cry. He immediately looked
back but could see no one approaching. He did not
look at any house in particular and he would not be
likely to notice anyone sitting on a step on the opposite
side of the street. He thought it was highly probable
that Farrell may have been sitting there, although he
did not notice him. Summing up the statements of
Ross, Strangman and Brookes we arrive at this conclusion:
Ross did not see Strangman in the street,
Strangman saw neither Ross nor Farrell, and Brookes,
looking between the blinds of his room on the other
side of the way, did not see any one of the three.
Having all this in view one is not justified in rejecting
Farrell's evidence as unworthy of belief.</p>

<p>The confusion which surrounds the stories of these
four witnesses is, however, not to be compared to the
complication of which <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell was the central
figure. The doctor appears to have been as talkative
as he was mean, passionate and amorous. At the
time of his death he was the possessor of about one
hundred thousand dollars made in his profession as
a dentist. He gave himself out as a bachelor, told
several persons that he was not married, never had
been, never intended to be, and least of all to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Cunningham, who, he contended, was endeavouring
<pb n="165"/>
to entrap or force him into a marriage. He also
said that he was in fear of her and of the people in
the house, and that she was capable of doing
anything to injure him. He made these assertions
so recently as on the very day of his death, and he
particularly begged his friend and late partner, a <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Blaisdell, to come and live in the house on that account.
He also declared that he had made a will, and named
some of his relatives and the amount of his bequests
to them, but that he did not intend to leave <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Cunningham anything. The will, it should be mentioned,
was not forthcoming during the coroner's
enquiry and its conditions were consequently not
established. No explanation as to what had become
of the document was offered.</p>

<p>Whatever doubt there was as to the existence of
a will, no doubt could be entertained respecting the
leaving of <abbr>No.</abbr> 31 to a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Stansbury. Burdell drew
the lease on the day of his death, intending to sign it
on the morrow, and he took advantage of the occasion
to express his great gratification at the prospect of
getting rid of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham and of the house.
He protested emphatically that she dogged him,
watched him, listened at his doors, entered his room
with false keys, stole the key of his fireproof safe
and had taken from it a note for 600 dollars--which
she had given him in payment for a judgment against
another party and which he had assigned to her.</p>

<p>Such relations as these, the <title>Tribune</title> remarked very
justly, were very singular between man and wife, but the
most striking evidence of all is against the hypothesis
of a marriage and <q>in favour of the other hypothesis
of a sham marriage between <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham and
<pb n="166"/>
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Eckel or someone else personating <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell,</q>
is found in the fact that she commenced a suit for
breach of promise against <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell in the previous
August or September, her complaint being that <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Burdell had criminally assaulted her. On October
22nd she dropped the suit, and on the 28th of the
same month the alleged marriage was said to have
taken place. To add to these contradictions we have
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham's lawyer, who was called as a witness,
telling the coroner that several weeks after October
28th she again applied to him saying that she had
it in contemplation to reopen or recommence the
suit for breach of promise--in other words, that three
weeks after her marriage she wanted to sue the man
who, if she spoke the truth, must then have been her
husband!</p>

<p>Whatever may have been at the bottom of this
coil, it is not to be questioned that when Burdell
accused <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham of robbing his account the
two were on very bad terms. On one occasion he called
in policemen to arrest her, but that they dissuaded
him from so doing. One of these policemen said at
the inquest that on this occasion she used violent
language towards the doctor and declared that <q>she
would have his heart's blood.</q> One of the women
servants of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham also gave evidence of
quarrels between <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham
and her eldest daughter Augusta, and that the doctor
told her (the servant) that in a dispute Augusta had
once attacked him personally and had torn out some
of his hair.</p>

<p>Viewing all the facts, bearing as they do upon
mercenary and jealous intrigues within the four walls
<pb n="167"/>
of the house of murder, it is clear that <q>motive</q>
must play an important part in the solution of the
mystery. Public opinion was in favour of the theory
that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham had established herself in
<abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burdell's house hoping to entrap him into a
marriage. Finding herself defeated in this object,
she induced her paramour Eckel to personate Burdell
in a sham marriage, either with the view of claiming
her dower, a sum of between 30,000 and 40,000 dollars
as Burdell's widow in case of his natural death, or
with her paramour assassinating him with that express
object, and that the fact that Burdell on the day
preceding the night of his murder had made a lease of
his house, by the signing of which at the time appointed
on the following day he would have dispossessed her
and her family and thrown them on the world, hastened
the catastrophe and caused his death to occur on the
night in question.</p>

<p>Imagination proceeded to reconstruct the crime.
It was held that the murder was perpetrated by the
assassins the instant Burdell entered his rooms. They
had not anticipated any outcry, and the single half-stifled
utterance of the word <q>murder</q> revealed
the deed at the time, the victim being nearly instantly
dispatched with fifteen wounds, almost any one of
which was by the doctors deemed fatal. It was
conclusively proved that a strong smell of burning
wool was perceived in Bond Street between half-past
one and two o'clock on Saturday morning, and this was
accounted for by the burning of the blood-stained
clothes of the murderers. The knife, of course, was
hidden or destroyed.</p>

<p>Of the inmates of <abbr>No.</abbr> 31, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ulman alone knew
<pb n="168"/>
nothing. He was out at the time and when he came
home all was over. It is difficult to believe that
such a crime could have been committed without
some of the inmates being cognisant of it, and it is
not surprising to find that the jury returned a verdict
to the effect that their belief was that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham
and Eckel were the principals in the murder, and that
Snodgrass either joined them in committing the act
or was an accessory before the fact. They also found
that Augusta and Helen, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham's daughters,
being in the house when the murder was committed,
had some knowledge of the facts which they had
concealed from the jury.</p>

<p>The trial commenced on May 6th, but only <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Cunningham was placed in the dock, the case
against Eckel and Snodgrass having been dismissed.
The trial lasted three days, but the prosecution was
unable to establish anything conclusive against the
prisoner, and the jury, after deliberating for an hour
and a half, returned a verdict of <q>not guilty.</q></p>

<p>On her release, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham, in no way impressed
by her narrow escape from being branded as a
murderess, asserted her rights as a widow, based on
the secret marriage which the murdered man had
repudiated. She was entitled to claim a third of
Burdell's estate, but not satisfied with this she schemed
to obtain possession of the whole and set about producing
an infant heir. She first employed a <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ahl
as her necessary medical assistant, but Ahl played her
false and disclosed the plot to the authorities. They
took no steps, but allowed the ingenious <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham
a free hand, and disguised as a Sister of Charity
she went to house where an infant from a hospital
<pb n="169"/>
was in readiness and was handed to her by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ahl.
The child was taken to 31 Bond Street and on the
following day its arrival was announced. The joy
of the <soCalled>mother</soCalled> was, however, speedily dashed, for
a policeman appeared on the scene and she was taken
into custody.</p>

<p>Her imprisonment was but of short duration. She
was set free, and the child and its real mother found
a home, while their attraction lasted, in Barnum's
Museum. All that one can say of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cunningham
is that if she had an active hand in the murder of
Burdell she must be placed at the side of Maria Manning,
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pearcey, Catherine Wilson, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gould,
Gabrielle Bompard, and other abnormal women malefactors.</p>

<p>The majority of the tragedies hitherto dealt with
appertain more to mystery than to romance.
There are others in which the two characteristics are
intimately blended and in some the romance is more
appealing than the mystery. Four instances may be
selected as typical of this variety of unsolved mysteries--the
pathetic story of Rose Carrington, the drama
of Adelaide Bartlett, the tragic fate of Mary Ashford,
the village belle, with its strange sequel, <q>The Wager
of Battle,</q> and the secret of a Cobham coppice. We
will take them in the order denoted.</p>

<div n="6.1" xml:id="carrington" type="section">
<pb n="172"/>
<head type="main">The Beautiful Rose Carrington</head>
<head type="sub">A Haunted Life</head>

<p>Three actors figure in the Carrington drama,
one a rich man of high scientific attainments,
an ardent student of astronomy, and a Fellow of the
Royal Society; the second, a beautiful woman of
small education; the third, a miscreant of the worst
type.</p>

<p>Felix Carrington by taste and training was apparently
the last man to whom romance would appeal.
All his life, absorbed in his favourite study, he had
been somewhat of a recluse. But maybe the constant
watching of the stars and the mystic speculations
induced by the loneliness and solitude of nightly
vigils tend to lead the mind from the world as workaday
people see it. Should the right woman cross his
path the philosopher forgets his philosophy and
abandons his science, and no one so ready as he to
fall in love and follow wherever that love may lead
him.</p>

<p>This appears, anyhow, to have been the fate of <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Carrington. While on a flying visit to London (his
residence was a little way in the country) he chanced
to pass a very handsome young woman by whom
he was at once irresistibly attracted. He had no
difficulty in making her acquaintance. She was a
<pb n="173"/>
stranger in London, she was lonely and in poor circumstances,
and probably was sufficiently appreciative
of the admiration of the well-dressed gentleman to
give him encouragement. That he was twice her
age made no difference.</p>

<p>The exchange of a few words stimulated his interest,
and one can imagine that it was not long before she
told him something about herself. She was a Somersetshire
girl and had all the luxuriant beauty of form
and brilliant colouring for which the Somersetshire
women are famed. Her manners were naturally
modest, her voice was soft and musical, and if <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Carrington discovered at that first interview she was
quite illiterate--she could not even read--the discovery
did not lessen his infatuation. If not quite a case of
Cophetua and the beggar maid, it was not far removed.</p>

<p>But Rose Helen Rodway--the name she gave--did
not tell her elderly admirer everything concerning
her life, as the latter was destined to find out. He
could easily have discovered something about her had
he chosen to go to Bristol, her native place, but he
was quite contented to take her as she was, a lovely
country girl with whom he was, rightly or wrongly
enraptured. Before long he made her his wife.</p>

<p>Some little time after the marriage a well set up,
middle-aged man of soldierly air made his appearance
on the scene and was introduced to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington
as his wife's brother. This was William Rodway.
He had been a trooper in the Dragoon Guards.</p>

<p>William Rodway was always out of work, and he
would come pretty often to his wealthy sister for
money. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington had settled a goodly sum
upon his wife, and she always had some spare cash.</p>

<pb n="174"/>
<p>This went on for some time, till on one occasion
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington went on a visit to Scotland. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Carrington was to follow him on the following day,
but she did not do so. When she saw her husband
he noticed she was in great distress, and bit by bit the
terrible truth came out.</p>

<p>William Rodway was not any relative but a man
who, before she met <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington, was her lover
and had exercised tremendous influence over her.
After her marriage he carried on a species of blackmail.
He got money from her continually; he compelled
her to meet him; and even obtained from her
her marriage certificate and other papers.</p>

<p>At last the prosecution became too persistent and
merciless to be borne, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Carrington told the
truth to her husband. The result of this confession
was that her husband urged her to break off her acquaintance
with the man.</p>

<p><q>I have never desired to keep it on,</q> she replied
sadly, <q>but he frightens me, and he has always
compelled me to meet him. I have never done so
willingly.</q></p>

<p>Just before this <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington had bought an estate
near Farnham. It was in the Weald of Surrey, in
that portion lying between Farnham and Hindhead,
and known as <q>The Devil's Jumps.</q> These three
remarkable hills bearing the Satanic designation are
quite isolated from the adjoining plain. The situation
being admirable for the observance of astronomical
and atmospheric phenomena, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington constructed
in the centre of one of these elevations, and at a
great outlay, an observatory, having previously erected
a large and handsome residence at the foot of the hill.</p>

<pb n="175"/>
<p>He hoped that in this out-of-the-way spot his wife
would be freed from the annoyances of Rodway.
This, however, did not prove to be the case. Rodway
found his way to Surrey, and used to frequent a
public house in the neighbourhood of Farnham and
talk of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Carrington in the most familiar fashion.
The matter soon began to be gossiped about, and
there was not one of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Carrington's servants who
did not know more about the lady's humble origin,
and her acquaintance with the rather good-looking,
soldierly man of middle age, than she did herself.</p>

<p>On one occasion, after having drunk a good deal
of beer, and allowed his tongue to run on about <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Carrington, he rapped out:</p>

<p><q>The fellow who has her shan't enjoy her much
longer. Before a month is over, I'll have her, dead
or alive!</q></p>

<p>All this while the poor lady was aware of his hanging
about the neighbourhood, and was in a state of mental
terror. Yet it does not seem she had the courage to
tell her husband.</p>

<p>On the 18th of August Rodway went to Farnham,
called at the public house before mentioned, and
stayed there for the night. On the following day
he went to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington's house and knocked at
the door.</p>

<p>Probably <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Carrington suspected it was her
persecutor, for instead of sending the servant she went
herself.</p>

<p><q>Rose,</q> said he, scowlingly, <q>I want the cloak
and shawl, the dog, and the money you owe me!</q></p>

<p><q>Very well, you shall have the money and the
other things, excepting the dog. I will send them
<pb n="176"/>
to you. As for the dog, that's my husband's, and I
must speak to him about it.</q></p>

<p>Upon this the man's scowl deepened, and he broke
out angrily:</p>

<p><q>I'll move you from that!</q></p>

<p>And he struck his stick on the ground.</p>

<p>He turned as if to go from her, and went a step or
two, but turned round again and stabbed her in the
arm. She tried to run away; but he followed her,
and stabbed her again in the back, and she fell, the
knife sticking in her.</p>

<p>He raised her, and took out the knife, exclaiming:</p>

<p><q>You've been a bad woman to me!</q></p>

<p>She seized the knife, and tried to take it from him.
He began to cut himself with it, and she cried:</p>

<p><q>Don't--don't! Throw it down!</q></p>

<p><q>It will soon be over, and we shall meet in heaven!</q></p>

<p>The disturbance was by this time audible to the
servants, and one of them came and watched and
listened, and saw the struggle, and did nothing.</p>

<p>In vain the poor wounded woman begged this girl
to run for help; but not a step did she stir. Whether
it was callousness, stupidity or terror we cannot say;
but the fact remains that she contented herself with
listening to all that passed.</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Carrington then, finding no help in the house,
dragged herself, bleeding from her wounds, towards
the inn.</p>

<p>On her way thither she was met by a man, who
assisted her, and while he was supporting her, Rodway
who had followed, passed them, and they all went into
the inn and sat down.</p>

<p><q>For Heaven's sake, go for a doctor!</q> she cried.</p>

<pb n="177"/>
<p>But the men were almost as stupid as the servant
girl. They seemed quite dazed.</p>

<p>Rodway then asked her to have some brandy, and
went on to say:</p>

<p><q>I've done all there is to be done, and if I've injured
her, I am very sorry for it. I never intended to hurt
her; but she treated me with such contempt that I
resolved to kill myself before her eyes.</q></p>

<p>By this time the country fellows hanging about the
inn roused themselves. One of them went for a constable,
and ultimately the man was secured.</p>

<p>On his way to the station he said to the constable:</p>

<p><q>Poor Rose! I loved her. I hope she'll not die;
I hope she'll recover.</q></p>

<p>His own cuts were not particularly serious. There
was one on his arm, and several slight ones on his
chest. If he had really intended to kill himself he
went about the work in a very half-hearted way.</p>

<p>The wounds of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Carrington were, on the other
hand, much more serious, and one nearly cost her
her life. But after a time she recovered and was
able to give evidence at the Kingston Assizes, the trial
taking place quite nine months after the occurrence.</p>

<p>She gave her evidence with great frankness and
apparent truthfulness, and without the least appearance
of reticence. She was cross-examined at great
length by the prisoner's counsel, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Edward (now
Sir Edward) Clarke, as to the painful circumstance
of her past life, and answered without hesitation,
though not without evident pain. Maybe it was a
relief to know that the torture she had suffered at
the hands of Rodway was at an end, though she had
to lay bare many painful reminiscences.</p>

<pb n="178"/>
<p>There seemed to be no doubt as to the guilt of the
man. It was proved that two days before the event
he bought a knife which opened with a spring, so as
to become fixed, and the blade of which was several
inches in length. Before he was arrested, he wrote
a letter to a friend, in which he said: <q>I have stabbed
the woman to the heart, I hope.</q></p>

<p>Despite this, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Clarke made a strong defence,
to the effect that Rodway meant to kill himself, and
aimed at his own heart the blow which, to his horror,
entered her arm, and through her arm to her chest.
Then, clasping her round the waist to support her,
they fell, and the knife unfortunately entered her
back. The argument in support of this theory was
that if Rodway had meant to kill her he could not
have failed to do so.</p>

<p>In this view, the ingenious barrister explained the
purchase of the knife with reference to the intention
to commit suicide, and he sought also to give the
expression in the letter a singular explanation. He
suggested the terms were not <q>I have stabbed the
woman to the heart, I hope,</q> but <q>I have stabbed
the wound to the heart, I hope.</q></p>

<p>But the judge and jury, who examined the letter
carefully, shook their heads at the suggestion, and
the counsel, beaten from one point, rushed to another,
and suggested that the letter was unfinished, and that
the sentence, <q>I hope,</q> had not been concluded, and
might mean, <q>I hope she will recover.</q></p>

<p>Unfortunately, these words were not written, and
there was nothing to support <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Clarke's plausible
supposition. The jury speedily found the miscreant
guilty.</p>

<pb n="179"/>
<p>It was then alleged that Rodway, years before, had
been guilty of felony. It was proved that a man
was then convicted (by the name of Edward Smith)
of manslaughter by killing a woman, and was sentenced
to a year's imprisonment, and the prisoner was identified
by one of the officers of the gaol where he was
confined. The officer, though over twenty years had
elapsed, recognised Rodway as Smith on seeing him along
with twenty other prisoners at Horsemonger Lane Gaol.
He should have known him, he said, among 5,000.</p>

<p>But this was trying to prove too much, and it
failed to satisfy the jury.</p>

<p>Had the prisoner's conviction been established,
Rodway would have been sentenced to penal servitude
for life. As it was, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Justice Bovill gave him twenty
years. It was pretty certain, said the learned judge,
that the fellow had been living on funds supplied by
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Carrington, and that, enraged at the discontinuance
of the supplies--for it was proved she had
sent him no money after going to reside at Farnham--he
had murderously assaulted her.</p>

<p>With the disappearance of Rodway from the scene
the tragedy does not end.</p>

<p>What effect the dastardly attempt on the life of
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Carrington, and the public exposure of her past
history, had upon the relations of husband and wife
it is impossible to say. No light has ever been thrown
upon the interior of the Carrington household. <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Carrington continued to live at his house at Farnham,
but we may be sure that life for both must have been
a solitary one. It is pretty certain that the county
gentry would hold aloof from visiting a house upon
which such a dark shadow rested.</p>

<pb n="180"/>
<p>Whatever was the state of affairs, a fresh sensation
occurred about three years after the conviction of
Rodway. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Carrington was found dead in her
bed. All that the coroner was able to find out was
that for some time past she had been in bad health.
A post-mortem was held, but the doctor could only
say that she had been suffocated. There was no
evidence to show how or when she died, nor
could it be discovered what was the cause of suffocation.</p>

<p>A curious fact was elicited during the process of
inquiry. There was no servant in the house, nor had
there been for some weeks. This was not because
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington could not afford the expense, because
he was a rich man, and the reason did not appear to
be forthcoming.</p>

<p>Anyway, the jury took their own view of the matter,
and at their request the coroner censured <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington
<q>for not finding a proper person to look
after his wife.</q></p>

<p>Even this was not the end of the fatal chain of
events. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington, after the death of his wife,
absented himself from home for about a fortnight.
Where he went to or what he did is not known. At
any rate, he returned to his desolate house at Farnham
one Saturday night, and was never seen again alive.</p>

<p>As he was known to be in the house, and as it was
also known that all the servants had left, his non-appearance
began to excite some alarm, and eventually
information was given to the police.</p>

<p>An inspector, accompanied by a constable, went
to the house about four days after <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington's
arrival, and found it silent and neglected. Knocking
<pb n="181"/>
at the door failed to bring any response, and eventually
an entrance was forced.</p>

<p>They searched the house, but found nothing suspicious
till they came to one of the servants' rooms.
The door was locked on the inside. This door was
broken open, and here they discovered <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington
lying dead on a mattress on the floor, between the
bottom of the bed and the fireplace, with a handkerchief
tied round his head. His watch was on the
mantelpiece, and had stopped at half-past twelve.</p>

<p>The police locked up the house, and returned the
next morning with a doctor. In the dining room
they found <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington's travelling bag, and in
it an empty chloral bottle. There were also found
other chloral bottles, all empty, in the dining room.</p>

<p>The doctor said that the handkerchief tied round
the head of the deceased was to hold a tea-leaf poultice
on the left ear, evidently put on to alleviate pain.</p>

<p>On making a post-mortem examination, the doctors
came to the conclusion that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington had died
from <q>apoplexy,</q> and that he had fallen down in a
fit.</p>

<p>It may have been so, but the explanation is not
very satisfactory. It is not clear why he selected
one of the inferior rooms in the house for his sleeping
apartment, nor why he should have placed the mattress
on the floor.</p>

<p>There the mystery remains. It does not seem
clear that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington had any relations. If so,
there is no mention of anyone belonging to his family
attending the inquest. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carrington died as he
lived--strange, mysterious, solitary.</p>

<head type="main">Adelaide Bartlett</head>
<head type="sub">Stranger than Fiction</head>

<p>All the elements of romance are to be found in
the strange story of Adelaide Bartlett. But,
in addition to its romance, the story is also of intense
interest as a study in psychology. Questions of
human weakness, of mental struggles, of temperamental
difficulties and differences are involved. Lastly
one is faced with one of the sex problems which have
beset man and woman from the earliest days, which
are a part of their inheritance and which will never
cease to plague them so long as the world remains
what it is. More than this need not be said here.
The facts tell their own tale.</p>

<p>The opening scene is a wedding in Croydon Parish
Church. The bridegroom was a man of at least
thirty-five years of age, the bride a girl just turned
sixteen.</p>

<p>There was nothing of the exuberant joy of the
young lover about Edwin Bartlett. He was restrained
in manner, and if his somewhat expressionless face,
with its abstracted look in the eyes, indicated anything,
it was settled satisfaction at the prospect of commencing
married life under the peculiar conditions
which he had laid down for himself and his wife and
over which he had long pondered.</p>

<pb n="183"/>
<p>These conditions were, to say the least, eccentric.
His girl-wife was little more than a child in ideas, in
feelings, in experience. She had read through the
strange marriage contract her husband had prepared
without comprehending its meaning, and, indeed,
some of its terms were so mystical that had she been
older she might not have been much the wiser.</p>

<p>It would be hard to find a parallel to the position
of the beautiful girl who, at an age when pinafores
and dolls are hardly forgotten, had become the wife
of a man old enough to be her father. Certainly no
novelist could imagine a more romantic and unusual
set of circumstances. She was an alien; she had
not a single friend in the land in which she was to make
her home to advise her, and she was marrying with
the full knowledge that some of her husband's relatives
were her enemies.</p>

<p>Adelaide Blanche de la Tremouille had, three months
before her marriage, come from Orleans on a visit to
the family of a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Charles Bartlett. There is no
mention of father and mother in the public records,
and she was probably an orphan. Gloriously handsome,
with her big, passionate, dark eyes, her luxuriant
hair, she had all the fervour of the southern temperament,
and Edwin Thomas Bartlett, Charles Bartlett's
brother, saw in her the embodiment of his morbid
ideas of love and marriage.</p>

<p>No doubt he tried to explain them to the young
girl, but probably she attached but little importance
to his theories. Englishmen used to be considered
by French people as all more or less mad, and maybe
Adelaide made allowances on this ground and thought
that everything would settle down sooner or later
<pb n="184"/>
into the humdrum, prosaic groove of married life.
She was mistaken. She was destined to become the
central figure in a mysterious life-drama, on which
the curtain was lifted sufficiently to whet curiosity,
and then suddenly lowered, leaving the dark mystery
unsolved.</p>

<p>The marriage contract, embodying the views of
Edwin Thomas Bartlett, laid down that a man should
have two wives--one for <q>companionship</q> and one
for <q>service.</q> Bartlett did not definitely explain
himself, but it was implied that by <q>service</q> was
meant household duties, cooking and the like, while
<q>companionship</q> was to be interpreted in a purely
intellectual sense.</p>

<p>The strange man looked upon his young bride as
his <q>wife-companion,</q> and in accordance with this
arrangement, the marriage was not followed by the
usual blissful honeymoon trip. Instead, the philosophical
Edwin packed off the girl whom he had just
made his wife to a school at Stoke Newington to
complete her education; and from there, later on, to
a convent school in Belgium.</p>

<p>It was the oddest state of affairs possible, the child-wife
working hard at her studies, spending her holidays
with her husband in apartments, and going back to
school at the end of each vacation.</p>

<p>Two years of this strange married life went over,
and then <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett came to England from her
convent school, permanently to live with her husband
at Herne Hill, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett had a grocer's shop.
A year after this his mother died, and at the joint
invitation of husband and wife, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett senior
went to live with them.</p>

<pb n="185"/>
<p>This was a great mistake, for the old man had always
disliked his son's young wife. The latter seems to
have been quite under the control of her eccentric
husband, and amiably acquiesced in everything he
suggested. But her mind had not been developed;
she had not reached her twentieth year and she had
not shaken off the effects of the unworldly convent
school training.</p>

<p>Throughout their married life, Edwin Bartlett
and his wife were looked upon by all who knew them
as a most affectionate couple, but it seemed that a
rift within the lute occurred about this period. Soon
after her father-in-law came to reside with them, he
began to circulate defamatory stories with regard to
his daughter-in-law. Ultimately he was prevailed
upon to write an apology, which was printed and
distributed at the instigation of Edwin Bartlett, who,
with all his odd notions, was devoted to his wife, and
indignant at the aspersions cast upon her.</p>

<p>During this time she became a mother. Her
experience was a very painful one and the child was
born dead. What influence the recollection of this
agonising period had upon her temperament and
upon her views of marriage cannot be said, but it is
not unreasonable to assume that a change was brought
about which had something to do with the tragic
events which happened afterwards.</p>

<p>Some two years after this domestic episode the
Bartletts removed from Herne Hill to another shop
in Lordship Lane, Dulwich; and from there to The
Cottage, Phipps Bridge, Merton Abbey, near Wimbledon,
and at Merton there entered upon the scene a
young man who was destined to influence the futures
<pb n="186"/>
of both <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett. This was George
Dyson, a Wesleyan minister, then about twenty-seven
years old.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dyson was in charge of a small chapel in the
High Street, Merton, which the Bartletts attended,
and he called upon them as members of his congregation.
The young preacher would occasionally take
tea at The Cottage, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett conceived such
a liking for him that he invited him to call more
frequently.</p>

<p>This pleasant friendship was interrupted for a
while by Dyson going to Trinity College, Dublin,
where he graduated and took his B.A. degree. On
his return to Merton, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett said he would like
his wife to take up her studies again, and requested
Dyson to have the supervision of them. Dyson
consented, and used to call and give <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett
lessons in Latin, history, geography and mathematics.</p>

<p>What Edwin Bartlett had in his mind in regard to
Dyson cannot be said for certain. Most people
would hold that in throwing his wife constantly in
the society of an educated man near her own age,
his action was extremely foolish. However this may
be, it does not seem that he had any object other
than a desire to see Adelaide become a woman of many
accomplishments. It apparently did not occur to
him that the <q>companionship</q> of the marriage
contract was likely to apply more to George Dyson
than to himself.</p>

<p>It will be gathered from a confidential conversation
which <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett had with the medical man, who
subsequently was called in to attend her husband,
that the latter had morbid tendencies tinging, if not
<pb n="187"/>
suggesting, the complacency with which he regarded
the relations of his wife with Dyson.</p>

<p>All that can be said on this point is that if Edwin
Bartlett was a little mad, there was considerable
method in his madness. Even his relations with
Dyson were laid down in accordance with a settled
plan; and from a letter he wrote to Dyson soon after
the latter was installed as Adelaide's tutor, we get an
inkling of what was going on in his mind. The letter
ran thus:</p>

<q type="letter">
<p><q rend="I">Dear George,--Permit me to say I feel great
pleasure in thus addressing you for the first time.
To me it is a privilege to think that I am allowed
to feel towards you as a brother, and I hope our
friendship may ripen as time goes on, without anything
to mar its future happiness. Would I could
find words to express my thankfulness to you for
the very loving letter you sent Adelaide to-day.
It would have done anybody good to see her overflowing
with joy as she read it whilst walking along
the street, and afterwards as she read it to me.
I felt my heart going out to you. I long to tell you
how proud I feel at the thought I should soon be
able to clasp the hand of the man who from his
heart could pen such noble thoughts. Who can
help loving you? I feel that I must say two words,
<q>Thank you</q>; and my desire to do so is my excuse
for troubling you with this. Looking towards
the future with joyfulness,</q></p>

<p>I am,<lb/>
Yours affectionately,<lb/>
Edwin.</p>
</q>

<pb n="188"/>
<p>Dyson's reply was couched in the same spirit:</p>

<q type="letter">
<p><q>Dear Edwin</q> (he wrote),--<q rend="I">Thank you very
much for the brotherly letter you sent me yesterday.
I am sure I respond from my heart to your wish
that our friendship may ripen with the lapse of
time, and I do so with confidence, for I feel that
our friendship is founded on a firm and abiding
basis--trust and esteem. I have from a boy been
ever longing for the confidence and trust of others.
I have never been so perfectly happy as when in
possession of these. It is in this respect among
many others that you have shown yourself a true
friend. You have thanked me and now I thank
you, yet I ought to confess that I read your warm
and generous letter with a kind of half fear--a fear
lest you should ever be disappointed in me and
find me a far more prosy and matter-of-fact creature
than you expect. Thank you, moreover, for the
telegram; it was very considerate to send it. I
am looking forward with much pleasure to next
week. With very kind regards,</q></p>

<p>Believe me,<lb/>
Yours affectionately,<lb/>
George.</p>
</q>

<p>This was the beginning of a new order of things.
What Adelaide thought of this closer friendship we
are not told definitely, but it would have been wonderful
if she had not a certain amount of affection for the
<q>friend of the family.</q> Indeed, there was much to
excuse her if she fell in love with him.</p>

<p>Shortly after this Dyson was appointed pastor of
a chapel in Putney, and the Bartletts removed from
<pb n="189"/>
Merton to Claverton Street, Pimlico, where they
lived in apartments. At Claverton Street the lessons
were resumed, and instead of coming once a week,
Dyson would call three or four times, generally about
three o'clock in the afternoon. The close partnership
of Dyson was indicated by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett providing
him with a season ticket, while a blue serge lounge
coat and a pair of slippers were kept for his use, so
as to make him feel at home and comfortable. They
were now on such terms of familiarity that husband
and wife would allude to him as <q>Georgius Rex.</q></p>

<p>Some time previously <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett made a will,
leaving all he possessed to his wife. This will was
as follows:</p>

<q type="letter">
<p rend="letdate"><q rend="I">Herne Hill, S.E.</q></p>
<p rend="letdate"><q rend="I">September 3rd, 1885.</q></p>
<p><q rend="I">I will and bequeath all my property and every
thing I am possessed of to my wife Adelaide, for her
sole use, and I appoint George Dyson, B.A., Wesleyan
minister, and E. Wood, solicitor, my executors.</q></p>
<p><q rend="I">(Signed) Thomas Edwin Bartlett.</q></p>
<p><q rend="I">Witness to my signature, Herbert Eustace</q></p>
<p><q>Arthur Brooks.&#x201d;</q></p>
</q>

<p>The Bartletts had now been married some ten years,
and up to this time Edwin Bartlett had been looked
upon as a strong, healthy man. After coming to
Pimlico, however, he suffered a good deal from neuralgia
and nerve disturbance generally, and there seems to
be little doubt that he dosed himself with all kinds
of medicine, as people who are in continuous pain
often are tempted to do. Then came on a sudden
<pb n="190"/>
illness, and for the first time a doctor was sent for,
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett acting on her own initiative in seeking
medical advice for her husband.</p>

<p>The doctor, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Alfred Leach, a surgeon, on examining
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett, was rather puzzled. The symptoms
indicated gastritis, but the state of the gums suggested
that the illness was due to mercury. Questioned
on the point by the doctor, the patient attributed
his condition to having taken a pill of unknown
strength out of a drawer of sample pills. The explanation
confirms the suggestion that Bartlett was addicted
to physicking himself indiscriminately.</p>

<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach, in his evidence given in connection with
what happened afterwards, threw an interesting sidelight
on the domestic life of the Bartletts, and especially
on the attitude of Edwin Bartlett towards his wife.</p>

<p><q>I remember distinctly,</q> he says, <q>on one occasion--I
think it was the first time I saw Dyson--seeing
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett sitting with a look of being lost in admiration
at his wife while she was discussing some subject
or other with Dyson. I don't think I took any part
in the conversation, for I was chiefly interested in
watching my patient, who stood, never uttering a
word, but concerned only in listening and admiring.</q>
Later on, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach said, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett spoke in terms
of the highest admiration and affection of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dyson.
<q>Oh, yes!</q> were his words. <q>We are very proud
of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dyson.</q></p>

<p>A little later <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Dudley was called in in consultation,
at the special desire of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett himself, on the
extraordinary ground that if anything fatal occurred
his friends might suspect his wife of having poisoned
him! <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Dudley examined the sick man, and found
<pb n="191"/>
that his organs were healthy, without the least sign
of any disease. He approved the treatment that
was being followed, and the suspicious symptoms
soon passed away.</p>

<p>From the beginning of his illness <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett had
occupied a small iron bedstead in the front sitting
room by the fireplace, while his wife rested on a sofa
or a chair. She attended to her husband night and
day with anxious attention, at night time seeing to
the fire, making beef-tea, etc., and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach stated
he could not have wished for a more devoted nurse.</p>

<p>Indeed, the doctor remonstrated with her for not
taking more rest, and in the course of the conversation
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett, in relation to her feelings towards her
husband, said:</p>

<p><q>I wish we were unmarried, so that we might
have the happiness of marrying again.</q></p>

<p>There is no reason to doubt her sincerity. She was
never weary of looking after him, and had ever his
comfort in her mind. For instance, the medicine
was kept on the mantelshelf, and when the doctor
asked her why she did not keep it on a table near
the bed, her answer was:</p>

<p><q>Oh, I like to make the room as little like an
invalid's room as possible!</q></p>

<p>Throughout his illness, which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett himself
put down to being mainly due to his having been
overworked in business, his condition was one of
nervous exhaustion and depression and he was evidently
hypochondriacal and anxious. He had crying fits,
and would sit in a chair and cry for an hour. When
asked why he did so, he gave the contradictory reply
that it was because he felt so happy. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach
<pb n="192"/>
advised him to go to Torquay without <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett,
as he was really an hysterical patient, and was too
much petted by his wife. A sea voyage would have
done him most good, the doctor thought.</p>

<p>On the 28th (the month was December) <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Bartlett went for a drive, and came home showing
every sign of returning health. On December 30th
he was so well that <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach decided to discontinue
his visits. The next day he dined about three in the
afternoon, when he ate a hearty meal of jugged hare.
In the evening, between five and six, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach called
to take his patient to the dentist to have another
tooth drawn. His gums had been in a very bad
state, and already he had had seventeen teeth
extracted.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett seemed better than the doctor had ever
seen him. He acknowledged he felt better--a thing
he was loth to admit, having made up his mind for
continued daily medical visits. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Roberts, the
dentist, extracted the tooth; he too considered
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett's condition and spirits to be much better.</p>

<p>This was the last time these two professional gentlemen
saw their patient alive.</p>

<p>It was December 31st. When he returned from the
dentist's, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett told his landlady that he
thought the worst was over and that he would soon
get better. He thanked her for the dinner she had
served him, and told her how much he had enjoyed it.</p>

<p>He had a tea-supper, with oysters, cake, chutney,
etc. He sat up to the meal, and afterwards walked
about the room. He was altogether in excellent
spirits, his mind dwelling on the good things of life,
for he told the maid to get him a haddock for the next
<pb n="193"/>
morning's breakfast, saying he would <q>get up an
hour earlier at the thought of having it.</q> It seemed
as though he alternated between over-eating and
over-dosing himself.</p>

<p>At four o'clock on the morning of New Year's Day,
the Doggetts, who owned the house, were aroused
by a knocking at their bedroom door.</p>

<p><q>Come down! I believe <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett is dead!</q>
was the startling announcement uttered in the agitated
voice of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett. Then the servant was sent
post-haste for the doctor.</p>

<p>When the Doggetts reached the drawing room,
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett asked them if they thought her husband
was dead, whereupon <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Doggett put his hand over
his heart.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> was the reply, <q>he must have been dead
two or three hours. He is perfectly cold.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett then explained what had happened.</p>

<p><q>I had fallen asleep,</q> said she, <q>with my hand
over his foot. I awoke with cramp in my arm, and
found him lying on his face. I put him in the position
in which you see him, and tried to pour brandy down
his throat.</q></p>

<p>When the Doggetts saw him, he was lying on his
back, with his left hand on his breast.</p>

<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach confirmed the landlord's statement that
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett had been dead from two to three hours.
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett then burst out crying bitterly.</p>

<p>The doctor was puzzled, and asked <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett
whether she could give him any explanation, and she
replied that she was unable to do so.</p>

<p>While the inquest was being held, and pending the
post-mortem and analysis, Adelaide Bartlett and
<pb n="194"/>
George Dyson met at the house of a mutual friend--a
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews. He was deadly pale, we are told,
and she had lost the lovely olive of her complexion.
It was now tinged with sallowness. It was not wonderful
that both should be agitated, for between them
maybe they held the secret of death.</p>

<p><q>You told me that Edwin would die soon,</q> he
began in a low voice, but not so low that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews
could not hear.</p>

<p><q>I did not!</q> was the emphatic reply.</p>

<p>Dyson did not pursue the subject. There was a
long pause. His eyes were cast down. Then nervously--almost
timidly--he said:</p>

<p><q>I wish you'd give me back those papers of mine,
Adelaide.</q></p>

<p>She looked at him in scorn. She saw clearly enough
that at the very moment when she needed support
and sympathy this man, who had benefited so much
from his acquaintance with her and her husband,
would fail her. She knew what papers he referred
to. On them were written some verses which he
had dedicated to her.</p>

<p>At that moment Adelaide Bartlett was perfectly
conscious of the terrible chain of condemning circumstances
which was slowly gripping her, and she was
conscious, also, that Dyson's object was to clear
himself, no matter what suspicion was attached to her.</p>

<p><q>I shall not give you the papers!</q> she cried
indignantly, and as much as to say, <q>If I am suspected,
so shall you be!</q></p>

<p>Then Dyson's nerve failed him, and he bowed down
over the piano, and the words, <q>I am a ruined man!</q>
burst from him.</p>

<pb n="195"/>
<p>Soon after he went out, and she made no effort to
detain him. She saw plainly enough she would have
to fight her battle alone.</p>

<p>Some days after this, Adelaide called on <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach.
She was anxious to know what the doctors had found
to cause her husband's death.</p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett,</q> said the doctor, <q>I think I have
some good news for you. Report says the Government
analyst is going to give acetate of lead as the
cause of death, which is nonsense; and there is also
another report that he is going to return chloroform
as the cause of death, and that is impossible. At
any rate, it should set your mind at rest. Had it been
one of those cases of secret poisoning--that is, poison
given in small doses--you might be accused by some
people of having poisoned him.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach's words were overwhelming--how overwhelming
he did not at the moment suspect. Her
answer struck him dumb with amazement.</p>

<p><q>I am afraid, doctor, it is too true!</q> she sighed.
<q>I wish that anything but chloroform had been
found!</q></p>

<p>She had reason, indeed, to wish this, for it was the
link which completed the chain of circumstances
from which, for anything she could tell, she might
never be able to free herself.</p>

<p>It all centred in a request she made of Dyson while
her husband was lying ill. She told him that <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Bartlett suffered from an internal complaint, for
which she had doctored him for five or six years.
He was very sensitive about it, and on that account
would have no regular doctor. The disease, she said,
caused him very great pain, and to soothe him she
<pb n="196"/>
was accustomed to use chloroform, which she applied
externally.</p>

<p>Upon receiving this explanation, about the truth
of which there is some doubt, the young Wesleyan
minister promised to obtain some of the drug if he
could. She handed him a sovereign to cover the
expense.</p>

<p>At a shop in Putney, within a few yards of his chapel,
he procured an ounce bottle of the drug, and at two
chemists at Wimbledon, who had been members of
his congregation, he succeeded in obtaining four
ounces more. He poured the whole into a larger
bottle and gave it to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett.</p>

<p>The inquest followed in due course and, according
to the medical evidence, chloroform was the only
poison found present in the body. Everything pointed
to the administration of a large and fatal dose of the
drug.</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett told the coroner that she had had
chloroform in her possession, and that she had obtained
it to soothe her husband when he fell into paroxysms
of neuralgic pain. On the last day of the year she
took the chloroform to him. He looked at the bottle,
took it, and put it on the mantelpiece by the side of
the bed. She went to sleep with her arm round his
foot, and then woke and found him dead.</p>

<p>But no bottle was found on the mantelpiece, nor
could Bartlett have reached it without rising in bed.
Moreover, taking chloroform internally causes great
pain unless the person is previously stupefied.</p>

<p>Then came a startling surprise. The <abbr>Rev.</abbr> George
Dyson voluntarily related the story of his share in
the mystery. The result was that the jury returned
<pb n="197"/>
a verdict of <q>wilful murder</q> against Adelaide Bartlett,
making Dyson <q>an accessory before the fact.</q></p>

<p>The trial came on, and lasted a whole week. No
evidence being offered against Dyson, he was at once
acquitted, and from the dock stepped into the witness
box to tell his story.</p>

<p>And it must be confessed that he seemed very
anxious to tell all he knew without any consideration
for the prisoner. One point on which the prosecution
laid stress was a statement alleged to have been made
to him by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett to the effect that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett
was suffering from some sort of internal complaint
and that she gave him chloroform to relieve him.
The post-mortem did not confirm this. All the organs,
said the doctors, were perfectly healthy. That this
was so did not affect <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett's belief that her
husband had an internal ailment. Edwin Bartlett
was a <foreign xml:lang="fr">malade imaginaire</foreign> and could easily conjure
up bodily dangers. A person of this temperament
is only happy when talking about himself, and he
might well have given his wife the idea that he was
not destined long for this world. It is feasible that she
might even have said that <q>Edwin might die soon,</q>
and with perfect honesty. The majority of women
are prone to exaggeration. It was, however, the line
of the prosecution to take everything seriously in order
to prove their case. The unfortunate expression of
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Maybrick that her husband was <q>sick unto
death</q> was twisted into a serious piece of evidence
against her when she might have meant the words
purely as a figure of speech. As to Adelaide Bartlett's
words, she denied she told Dyson that <q>Edwin might
die soon.</q> Dyson could not remember every word
<pb n="198"/>
of the various conversations he had with the woman
with whom he was in love, and he might have forgotten
those particular words, but he did not choose to do
so, and he did not appear to be concerned whether
they would prejudice her in the eyes of the jury.</p>

<p>On the question of the purchase of the chloroform
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dyson was frank enough. He had been asked
by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett to get four ounces, but he was afraid
to ask for so much of one chemist, so spread his
purchases over three, alleging in each case that his
purpose was to remove grease stains. The one bottle
containing the three different quantities he gave to
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett on the Grosvenor Road Embankment
and handed her the change out of the sovereign he
had from her for the purchase. This was on December
29th. On the 30th <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett upbraided him for
something he had said. <q>I had advised her,</q> explained
Dyson, <q>to get a nurse to assist her, consequent
upon her telling me that friends were saying unkind
things about her--that she was not giving him full
attention.</q> She replied that I suspected her--did
not trust her. This was said in the presence of her
husband, who exclaimed, <q>Oh, you can trust her.
If you'd had twelve years' experience as I have had
you'd know you could trust her.</q></p>

<p>There was nothing in her reproach of Dyson, taken
by itself, but when on the following day Dyson received
from her a letter in which she said it was her great
grief to tell him that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett had died at two
o'clock that morning, it was possible for ill-natured
people to read into her objection to have assistance
something akin to a sinister motive.</p>

<p>This was on Friday. Dyson went to see her on
<pb n="199"/>
Saturday and she told him what had happened, using
much the same words as she had written him. On
the way to the Westminster Town Hall, where the
inquest was held, Dyson asked her if she had used
the chloroform and she said, <q>I haven't used it. I
haven't had occasion to use it. The bottle is there
just as you gave it me.</q> <q>This is a very critical
time for me,</q> said Dyson, <q>and then she told me to
put away from my mind the fact that she possessed
a medicine chest and that I had given her the
chloroform.</q></p>

<p>We have already given a summary of what occurred
between <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett and Dyson at the house of
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews, but as Dyson in his evidence went
fully into the matter we append his version.</p>

<p>On January 4th Dyson called on <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach and then
went on to Peckham where the Matthews lived, there
saw <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett and asked her what she had done
with the chloroform. She said, <q>Oh, damn the
chloroform!</q> was very angry and stamped her foot
and rose from her chair. <q>At this point,</q> said
Dyson, <q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Matthews came in and went out again.
I reminded her what she had said about <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett's
internal ailment and wanted to know if anything had
been said about it at the post-mortem. I asked her
if she did not tell me Edwin's life would be a short
one. <q>You did tell me that Edwin was going to die
shortly.</q> She said she did not. I said, <q>I am a
ruined man.</q> I then told her I was going to make
a clean breast of the affair; that I should tell everything
I knew about it. She did not wish me to do
so. She did not wish me to mention the chloro-
form.</q></p>

<pb n="200"/>
<p>A watch left by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett to Dyson <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett
had given him on the day after <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett's death
and this watch Dyson wanted to return to her and
did so.</p>

<p>Dyson, apparently, had but one idea--his own
safety. He had certainly committed himself. His
difficulty was how to explain why he had bought 4
ounces of chloroform in so secret and circuitous a
fashion. One may accept his belief that the chloroform
was to soothe pain from an internal trouble.
It is highly probable that Adelaide told him this.
It does not follow that she also told him her husband
was likely to die soon. As will be seen later on, she
had another reason at the back of her mind for wanting
the chloroform, but this reason was of a nature which
she could not disclose to anyone--least of all to Dyson.</p>

<p>But there the chloroform was; Dyson had bought
the stuff and it had to be accounted for. Naturally,
he asked <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett what had become of it. She
was indignant and asked why he did not charge her
direct with giving the chloroform. Afterwards she
said she had poured out the chloroform and had
thrown away the bottle.</p>

<p>This proved to be the fact. In travelling to Peckham
by train she had thrown the bottle out of the
carriage window. In so doing she had practically
imitated Dyson, who had not only thrown away on
Wandsworth Common the bottles in his possession,
but afterwards pointed out the spot to the police
where they were found.</p>

<p>In the face of all this, the important point to be
decided is the purpose for which <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett wanted
the chloroform. If the story she told <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach was
<pb n="201"/>
correct--and extraordinary as it may appear, it bears
the aspect of truth--she did not want the chloroform
to injure her husband or to relieve pain, but simply
to lull him to sleep with an object which some married
women may appreciate but will not discuss.</p>

<p>She confided the poignant story of her married life
wholly and solely to the doctor and we give it without
comment. <q>Being married young,</q> <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach told the
court, <q>she had been induced to enter into a marriage
compact scarcely understanding the meaning of its
terms; and this marriage compact was that the
marital relations of the pair were, in deference to
certain peculiar views held by her husband, to be of
an entirely platonic character, with a solitary exception
when a breach of the terms was permitted in consequence
of her fondness for children and her anxiety
to become a mother. After her confinement, the
former terms--those of a platonic nature--were resumed,
she being indifferent in the matter. Her
husband was affectionate and they each strove in
every way to fulfil each other's wishes and succeeded
in living upon most amicable terms.&#x2026; She said
her position had not been an easy one. It might be
almost called cruel, for her husband, though meaning
no cruelty, put her in a position very difficult for a
woman to maintain. No female friends were ever
invited to the house, or relations, but he had always
liked to surround her with male acquaintances. She
said: <q>He thought me clever, he wished to make me
more clever, and the more attention and admiration
I gained from these male acquaintances, the more
delighted did he appear.</q> During the last few
months of his life the man's nature seemed to be
<pb n="202"/>
somewhat changed. <q>We became acquainted with
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dyson and,</q> said she, <q>my husband threw us
together. He requested us in his presence to kiss
and he seemed to enjoy it.</q> She gave me to understand--in
fact, she used these words, <q>he had given
me to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dyson.&#x2026;</q> Now her husband having
fully effected the transfer, I mean in the platonic
sense, wished to resume marital rights. This <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Bartlett resented. She said, <q>Edwin, you know
you have given me to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dyson; it is not right that
you should do now what during all the years of our
married life you abstained from.</q> She said it was
a duty to her womanhood and to the man to whom
she was practically affianced at his wish, and he agreed
that she was right.</q></p>

<p><q>Now, as he got better while I was treating him,
these manifestations of his became very urgent and
she sought for means the more thoroughly to emphasise
her appeal to him or to prevent his putting his impulses
into effect, and one of the means, unfortunately, was
the possessing herself of a quantity of chloroform.
She said her object was to sprinkle some upon a handkerchief
and wave it in his face every time it was
necessary, thinking that thereby he would go peacefully
to sleep.</q></p>

<p><q>Then she went on to say: <q>I never kept a secret
from Edwin and the presence of that chloroform in
my drawer troubled my mind. And I was also
troubled with some scruples as to whether putting
my plan into practice would have been right, whether
I should be doing a right or a wrong thing, and the
last day of the year when he was in bed I brought
the chloroform to him and gave it to him.</q> I
<pb n="203"/>
asked her,</q> said <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach, <q><q>Was not your husband
very cross with you, or alarmed, or what was his
demeanour?</q> She said, <q>No, he was not cross;
we talked amicably and seriously and he turned
round on his side and pretended to go to sleep, or to
sulk, or something of that kind.</q> He looked at the
chloroform, she explained, which was in a large, round
bottle, corked, and not full, and put it by the side
where he was sitting or lying, on the mantelpiece at
the corner. The next thing was that she fell asleep
sitting in the chair where she always slept. I may
add,</q> said <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach, <q>she had slept there ever since
I had attended the patient, notwithstanding my
remonstrances. She went to sleep with her arm
round his feet, then awoke and heard him
snoring, and then woke again and found he was
dead.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach spoke highly of her care and attention
of her husband during his illness. A better nurse,
he said, he could not wish to have. He was also
emphatic as to her anxiety for an immediate post-mortem
examination.</p>

<p>The trial lasted six days, and there were moments
when things looked very ugly against the pale little
fragile woman in the dock, but she was defended by
one of the most powerful advocates of that time,
Sir Edward Clarke, then <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Clarke, and she must
have felt hopeful as he parried every point directed
against her and turned it to advantage. As there
was no direct evidence as to the administering chloroform,
the prosecution advanced the theory that she
had first stupefied her husband by inhalation, and
while he was unconscious had poured the chloroform
<pb n="204"/>
down his throat. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Edward Clarke, who had
mastered everything that was to be learned about
chloroform and its properties, drew from <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stevenson,
the distinguished analyst, the opinion that
chloroform could not have been so given without
causing intense irritation, apart from the difficulty
of inducing the act of swallowing. In other words,
had it been so administered, as the prosecution suggested,
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bartlett must have been awakened.
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Clarke laid great stress on <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett's earnest
desire that the post-mortem should be performed
without delay, pointing out that the shorter the interval
between death and autopsy the more likely was it
that poison--supposing it had been taken--would
be found. Had Adelaide Bartlett been guilty she
would have urged some reason for postponing the
post-mortem, but it was the other way.</p>

<p>It was significant that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Justice Wills, in his summing-up,
supported <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Clarke in his contention on
this point and admitted that it was in the prisoner's
favour. His lordship was not disposed readily to
accept <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett's reason as disclosed by her to
<abbr>Dr.</abbr> Leach for wanting the chloroform. He supported
his objection by an allusion to a matter which need
not be gone into here. It is sufficient to say that his
lordship did not sufficiently appreciate how a woman
might act under circumstances which appealed to
her whole nature. The summing-up, however, must
be pronounced extremely fair, and if anything, the
balance was in favour of the prisoner.</p>

<p>The stress and strain upon the woman with an issue
of life or death facing her was terrible, and Sir Edward
Clarke in his <title>Memoirs</title> tells how at the turning point
<pb n="205"/>
of the trial he received a slip of paper from the dock
with these pathetic words:</p>

<p><q>Monsieur, I am very grateful to you although
I do not look at you.</q></p>

<p>When the jury, after a prolonged absence, returned
into court and the foreman announced the verdict,
<q>Not guilty,</q> the intense strain he had gone through
had its effect on the great lawyer, and for the first
time during his fifty years of advocacy he broke down.</p>

<p><q>I found myself sobbing,</q> he writes. <q>I dropped
my head on the desk before me and some twenty
minutes passed before I recovered myself.</q></p>

<p>The public were wildly excited, and such a demonstration
of feeling on behalf of a woman who had been
declared innocent of a terrible charge has rarely been
seen. Her advocate shared her triumph. As he
made his way to the courtyard the jury were awaiting
to grasp him by the hand, his carriage was surrounded
by a cheering crowd along the Old Bailey, and in
Holborn it was a continuous shout of delight from
pedestrians and from omnibuses.</p>

<p>Yet the puzzle of the chloroform remained. Certain
it is that chloroform was found in Edwin Bartlett's
body and as certain that it killed him. How did it
get there? The strange thing is that his death
should have immediately followed that intimate talk
with his wife. The man's mind was not normal. Is
it possible that in a spasm of dementia he put the
bottle to his lips? How long it would take for
chloroform to act when taken internally is not known.
It has been asserted that the death of Bartlett from
this cause is the only case on record. The medical
witnesses did not think so, but they were not very
<pb n="206"/>
positive. It is admissible to suggest that, though
suffering great pain, he had time to replace the bottle
on the mantelshelf, and in his agony to have turned
round as <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bartlett described. However this may
be, the veil that hides the fate of Edwin Bartlett has
never been lifted.</p>

<head type="main">Mary Ashford</head>
<head type="sub">The Wager of Battle</head>

<p>The tragedy of Mary Ashford occupies a unique
position in the chronicles of crime. It was not
a motiveless murder, for the object of the miscreant
was plain enough and the death of his victim was the
only method by which he could escape the penalty
of his previous offence. The case stands out beyond
all others because its sequel involved the revival of
a law which dated from feudal times--decision by
Wager of Battle.</p>

<p>It was Whit Monday--a holiday always looked
forward to by country lads and lasses and marked by
much merrymaking. Among others, Daniel Clarke,
the landlord of an inn known as Tyburn House, at
Cudworth, a village just outside Birmingham, made
preparations for holiday festivities, and his big room
was crowded with joyous villagers, who danced to their
hearts' content to the music of a fiddle.</p>

<p>The prettiest girl there was Mary Ashford, the
niece of a farmer named Colman, living at Langley
Heath, a town situated a few miles from Birmingham.
She was full of life and gaiety and never wanted for
a partner.</p>

<p>Every young man in the room was anxious to have
a dance with pretty Mary Ashford, but the favoured
<pb n="208"/>
swain was undoubtedly Abraham Thornton, a farmer's
son, of Erdington, an adjoining parish.</p>

<p>It was the first time Abraham Thornton and Mary
Ashford had met, but from an acquaintance with her
sister, of which he boasted during the evening to a
companion, it was clear that he knew something about
her. To understand clearly the various steps leading
up to the mystery of that fateful night, it is necessary
to say what were Mary Ashford's arrangements in
reference to this dance.</p>

<p>Early in the day she had to go to Birmingham on
some business for her uncle, and to save time she made
her holiday dress into a parcel and left it at the house
of a <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mary Butler, an old lady with whom lived
a friend of Mary Ashford's named Hannah Cox, who
was also going to the dance.</p>

<p>Mary returned from Birmingham at six o'clock,
dressed herself at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Butler's, and she and her friend
Hannah, laughing and talking, went off to the dance.</p>

<p>The time passed rapidly. Thornton, like most
village swains, was ardent in his love-making, and
Mary was not averse to receiving his attentions.
Hannah Cox, who had not so many admirers as her
friend, was the first to discover how the night was
advancing.</p>

<p>She went to look for Mary, and found her talking
with Thornton and evidently absorbed in what the
young man was saying.</p>

<p><q>Mary!</q> said she, <q>do you know what the time
is? We ought to be home!</q></p>

<p><q>Let her stay a little longer, Hannah,</q> pleaded
Thornton. <q>You don't want to go just yet, do you,
Mary?</q></p>

<pb n="209"/>
<p><q>I think I ought to go,</q> said Mary, but with eyes
which seemed to say, <q>If you ask me, I shall stay!</q></p>

<p><q>One more dance, anyhow?</q> said Thornton.</p>

<p>Hannah consented to wait for one more, and only
one. But one was not enough, either for Thornton
or Mary; and Hannah Cox, tired out, left the dancing
room just before midnight and waited outside, hoping
that Mary would soon follow her. Hannah remained
a quarter of an hour chatting to a young man named
Carter; but Mary did not come. At last Carter, at
Hannah's request, re-entered the house, found Mary,
and told her that her friend had been outside waiting
for her a quarter of an hour in the cold.</p>

<p>Mary, at this, made up her mind to join her friend,
left the dancing room, and in a few minutes found
Hannah. Mary was then accompanied by Abraham
Thornton.</p>

<p>Mary Ashford and Thornton started homewards,
followed by Hannah Cox and Carter; but after
proceeding some distance, Carter wished his three companions
<q>Good night,</q> and returned to Tyburn House.</p>

<p>The old saying, <q>Two are company, three are none,</q>
proved true in the present instance, for Mary Ashford
and Thornton, without any apology, left the superfluous
Hannah to get home how she could. The last
Hannah saw of the two was near a turning by an inn
on the road.</p>

<p>Hannah, naturally feeling annoyed and slighted,
walked on, and reached her home about one o'clock,
and, thoroughly tired out with dancing and walking,
got into her bed and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>About four o'clock she was awakened by someone
knocking loudly at the door. Naturally surprised
<pb n="210"/>
and vexed at being disturbed by so early a visitor,
she looked out of the window and saw her friend
Mary Ashford.</p>

<p>She at once ran down and let her in. Mary had the
clothes on she wore at the dance, and in reply to the
natural inquiries of Hannah as to the reason of this,
she explained that, instead of walking to her uncle's
at Langley Heath, she had gone to her grandmother's,
who lived near Tyburn House, and had slept there,
and now wanted to change her things and go home
to her uncle's.</p>

<p>Whilst engaged in changing her clothes and making
up a bundle of the things taken off, she chatted away,
and seemed delighted with the previous night's fun;
and at a quarter-past four o'clock Mary Ashford left
the cottage, carrying her little parcel.</p>

<p>From what was discovered afterwards, it would
seen that the unhappy girl not only told her friend
a deliberate untruth but, in addition, suppressed
the truth.</p>

<p>She had not slept at her grandmother's, and she
had spent the whole time, between Hannah losing
sight of her and her arrival at the cottage at four
o'clock in the morning, prowling about the fields
with Abraham Thornton.</p>

<p>After leaving <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Butler's cottage, Mary was seen
by two men named Dawson and Broadbent. The
latter noticed her at half-past four crossing the London
and Chester turnpike road, going in the direction of
Langley Heath.</p>

<p>From that moment she was never again seen alive.</p>

<p>At the same time--half-past four o'clock--Thornton
was spoken to by a milkman named Jennings, and
<pb n="211"/>
was at the same time and place seen by three other
persons--Martha Jennings, Jane Heaton and John
Holden. A mile further on he stopped and chatted
with a man named John Haydon, at Castle Bromwich.
This occurred at ten minutes to five, and from that
point Thornton undoubtedly went straight home to
his father's house. He certainly was not seen in
company with Mary.</p>

<p>On the same morning, at seven o'clock, a workman
was going along a path by the side of a field, a mile
and a quarter from <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Butler's cottage and in the
direction of Langley Heath, when he noticed on the
slope of a broad ditch a bonnet, a pair of shoes, and
a bundle. He stopped and looked round, in expectation
of discovering the owner of the things, but seeing
no one to whom the property could belong, he thought
the better thing would be to go to a mill in the neighbourhood
and give the alarm, as the probability was
either that some woman had been murdered or had
committed suicide.</p>

<p>He accordingly went to the mill, obtained assistance,
and the ditch was dragged.</p>

<p>After a few minutes' search the body of a young
woman was brought to the bank. It was that of
Mary Ashford.</p>

<p>On examining the body, marks of a human hand
were found between the shoulder and elbow of each
arm, showing that the girl had been recently grasped
and held with violence.</p>

<p>The report of the discovery spread with great
rapidity in all directions, and in a short time Abraham
Thornton was arrested on suspicion, he having been the
last seen in the poor girl's company prior to her death.</p>

<pb n="212"/>
<p>Abraham Thornton was tried for the murder of
Mary Ashford at the Warwick Assizes, and the theory
of the prosecution was that Thornton had murdered
the girl and thrown her body into a ditch; and in
support of this, it was proved there were footprints
in the field in which the ditch was situated which
exactly corresponded with Thornton's boots, and,
beyond that, even the nails in them.</p>

<p>To this Thornton replied that he admitted the
marks in the ground were probably his footprints,
as he had been in the field with the unfortunate girl
during the night.</p>

<p>A significant fact was that though footprints identified
as those of Mary were found intermingled with
those believed to be Thornton's in the field, not any
marks of the girl's boots could be found near the
ditch. The inference was that the murderer had
carried her from the spot where possibly she became
insensible and unable to utter a cry, and had thrown
her into the ditch.</p>

<p>It was proved that duckweed was floating on the
surface of the ditch where the body was found, and
at the post-mortem examination duckweed was found
in the stomach, which proved that Mary was alive
at the time she entered the water.</p>

<p>It was contended on behalf of Thornton that
as Mary Ashford left Hannah Cox at a quarter-past
four, and Thornton had been seen by Jennings and
three others at Holden's farm, which was two miles
and a half from the ditch in question, at half-past
four, it was impossible for him to have had any hand
in her death, as that only allowed a quarter of an
hour for Mary to go a mile and a quarter to the ditch
<pb n="213"/>
where she was murdered, and for Thornton to tramp
two miles and a half.</p>

<p>One curious point did not attract the attention
the prosecution should have paid to it. Mary
Ashford's clothing was much bloodstained, but that
of Thornton was not examined. Dale, the constable
who took him into custody, had spirited it away!
For this unwarrantable action Dale was dismissed
from the force.</p>

<p>The guilt of Thornton was not clearly made out.
His counsel fought hard; the judge summed up, and
cautiously; and the jury, giving the young man the
benefit of the doubt, found him not guilty.</p>

<p>This by no means satisfied the public. It had made
up its mind that Thornton was guilty, and as he
issued from the court he narrowly escaped with his
life, for the mob set upon him on all sides.</p>

<p>A tremendous excitement arose. The case, pro
and con, was hotly discussed everywhere, and eventually
an astute lawyer, having an eye to his own
pocket, conceived a way by which Thornton might
be tried again, although the law of England says that
a man cannot be tried a second time for the same
offence. What he did was to rake up a long-forgotten
statute not repealed, by which a legal matter
could be decided by what is called <q>Wager of Battle,</q>
which, like a good many other customs, was introduced
into this country by the Normans. Although it was
surrounded by many technicalities, it can be briefly
described as follows:</p>

<p>Where a man has been tried and acquitted for
murder, the heir of the murdered person could insist
upon the accused man being again arrested with the
<pb n="214"/>
object of having him tried again by fighting. For this
purpose the heir of the murdered one charges the
defendant with the murder, which, having been found
not guilty, he, of course, denies. He follows the
assertion of his innocence by throwing down his glove,
and declaring himself ready to fight to prove the truth
of his statement.</p>

<p>The challenge was accepted by the heir, and unless
he had something to allege showing that the defendant
was not entitled to the great privilege and honour
of fighting to prove his innocence (which was the
course adopted in Thornton's case), a day was appointed
by the court for the combat.</p>

<p>On the day fixed for the battle the parties met in
the presence of the judges; each man was armed
with the prescribed weapons, and having taken a
solemn oath that he had not made any private arrangements
with the devil to render him any assistance,
the two combatants set upon each other with all the
force they could muster, whilst the judges, attired
in their robes, looked on, and the rabble applauded
or hooted as their inclination prompted.</p>

<p>If the defendant was defeated and not killed, that
was considered proof positive of his guilt, and the
judges sentenced him to be hanged forthwith. If,
on the other hand, he was victor, or kept up the
combat until starlight, or till his accuser cried <q>Craven!</q>
he was declared innocent, and was not only
discharged, but his accuser was ordered to pay him
damages for having falsely accused him.</p>

<p>It seemed absurd that such a barbarous custom
should be actually legal in the nineteenth century;
but there it was, and William Ashford, the brother
<pb n="215"/>
of the murdered girl, proceeded against Thornton
for wager of battle, and Thornton was again arrested
by the Sheriff of Warwick and brought to London.</p>

<p>He was arraigned before the Lord Chief Justice in
Westminster Hall, and, when charged by Ashford
with having murdered his sister, took off his glove,
according to the ancient custom, and threw it on the
floor, declaring himself ready to fight. Ashford
was, however, only a stripling, and Thornton a powerful
man, and the idea of a combat was preposterous.
But the astute solicitor did not mean that Ashford
should fight. The whole thing was a trick by which
Thornton should be tried a second time.</p>

<p>This the judge would not have. If Ashford wanted
to put the old law into force it was open to him to
fight, but he could do no more. The end was that
Ashford declined the combat, proceeded no further,
and Thornton was again discharged.</p>

<p>In the following year Parliament passed an Act by
which the ridiculous <q>Wager of Battle</q> was put
an end to, and it ceased to encumber the Statute Book.</p>

<p>From that day to this the death of Mary Ashford
has remained a mystery. Quite a shower of pamphlets
came out at the time, half of them proving beyond
the shadow of a doubt that Thornton was guilty;
the other half proving quite as satisfactorily that
he was innocent. Anyway, her grave is still pointed
out in Sutton Coldfield churchyard, and no doubt the
villagers are ready with the moral lesson which
her fate is supposed to show to flighty young ladies
who go to village dances at public houses, take a little
too much to drink, and walk about with young men
in the small hours of the morning.</p>

<head type="main">The Secret of a Cobham Coppice</head>

<p>One July evening two young men went into the
White Lion, the principal inn in the picturesque
village of Cobham, Surrey, and asked for two pint
bottles of port wine. The request, under ordinary
circumstances, would have seemed peculiar, for the
port wine of most country inns is not a vintage one
cares for. But the White Lion was an old posting
house, with stabling for some twenty horses, and
was known for the excellence of its wines.</p>

<p><q>We have no small bottles,</q> said the barmaid.</p>

<p><q>Very well, we'll have a large one,</q> answered the
elder of the two men.</p>

<p>The wine was brought, and the barmaid tried to
put it in the fishing pannier which the younger one
carried; but it was too large.</p>

<p><q>Take your pouch out of the basket, Herbert,</q>
said the elder man.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the one addressed as Herbert took a
small leather bag out and thus made room for the
bottle of wine.</p>

<p><q>We shan't want the pouch,</q> said he. <q>It will
only be in our way. Perhaps you'll take care of it
for us, miss, until to-morrow?</q></p>

<p>The young lady said she would, and the travellers
left the inn. They looked as if they were going on
<pb n="217"/>
a fishing expedition. One of them had a rod in a bag.
The contents of the pouch, which was emptied before
it was left, consisted of a pair of scissors, tweezers,
and some artificial flies.</p>

<p>The barmaid took special notice of the elder man,
for there was something very peculiar about his face
and manner. Indeed, he seemed <q>quite lost</q>--so
much so, that he was going out without paying for
the wine. The barmaid, as may be guessed, reminded
him of the omission, upon which the younger man
produced some money and paid.</p>

<p>As they were leaving, the younger one said they
were going to Stoke D'Abernon, but they went towards
Walton Heath, which is in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The next day came, but the pouch was not called
for, nor was it the next, or the next. Apparently
the strangers had forgotten their property.</p>

<p>Cobham is now well known to cyclists; but in the
pre-cycle days it was a very secluded and out-of-the-way
spot. It is situated on the River Mole, where
the travellers were presumably going to fish.</p>

<p>Some days after the visit to the White Lion a little
girl, wandering near the banks of the river, found a
fishing rod, put together, and with the line attached,
leaning against a bush. She passed on, thinking
that it belonged to some persons fishing, who would
return for it; but, finding it still there when she came
back, she took it to her father.</p>

<p>A week went by, and then came a terrible discovery.</p>

<p>A short distance from Cobham a bridge crosses
the River Mole, and the road traverses rough, unenclosed
land known as Walton Heath. Three roads
are near the bridge, enclosing a triangular piece of
<pb n="218"/>
ground planted with trees. This spot did not abut
on the bank of the river, but was only a short distance
from it.</p>

<p>It was the 1st of August. Three men, residents
of Cobham, passed over the bridge for a walk on the
heath. When they were near the rough waste land,
one of them said:</p>

<p><q>Something here smells very bad. There must
be a dead dog or a cat. The parish ought to look to
it. I've half a mind to see what it means.</q></p>

<p>And he went into the coppice. In a minute or so
his friends heard him shouting, and they ran into
the coppice also. Here they beheld a most horrifying
spectacle--the corpses of two men, the one resting
on the other, in a very advanced state of decomposition.
The appalled spectators hurried away, and sent a
policeman to the spot. The constable brought with
him a number of the villagers--for the news had
spread--and examined the place.</p>

<p>One body was lying on its back, with a railway rug
over the face; the other was lying on the right side,
close to, and in the direction nearly parallel to, the
other, on the head of which the hand was lying.</p>

<p>They had evidently been lying there for many days.
The clothes of both were undisturbed, and so far
as the action of the weather and the horrible
state of the bodies would permit one to judge, the
garments seemed to indicate persons of the better
class.</p>

<p>A strange, miscellaneous collection of articles was
found upon the bodies and on the ground. Two
pistols, both of which had been discharged; a tin
box containing percussion caps; a pill-box, with two
<pb n="219"/>
conical bullets; bullets loose in the pockets; a fishing
pannier containing a rod-bag; a fly-book, with flies,
and some writing in pencil which had been defaced;
glasses, money, white cambric handkerchiefs, and
other articles of personal use.</p>

<p>On the ground was a wine bottle, with the neck
broken off, which had contained port wine, and on
one of the dead men was found a flask containing
a little weak brandy-and-water. One of the men
appeared to be thirty-five and the other twenty-five
years of age.</p>

<p>The discovery of the port wine bottle furnished a
clue as to their identity up to a certain point. The
barmaid of the White Lion recollected the two strangers
who bought and took away the bottle of port, and
she was able to say at the inquest that the appearance
of these men corresponded with that of the deceased.</p>

<p>But here the clue ended. Meanwhile, the widest
excitement was caused throughout the district, and
the theories of murder, of suicide, of a duel, were
hotly discussed.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people visited the spot. The Sunday
trains were crowded with morbid sightseers from
London, the grass round about the coppice was
trodden down, and the ground became dry and bare
with the constant movement of feet.</p>

<p>Of course, the local residents were full of curiosity,
and among these was a woman who, poking about
the scrub with her umbrella, picked up a printed
paper--a tailor's circular. This woman lived a short
distance from Walton Heath, and, by a curious
coincidence, it turned out that on the evening of
July 24th she heard the sounds of two reports.</p>

<pb n="220"/>
<p>The woman put the circular in her pocket as a sort
of memento, and took it home to show her family.</p>

<p><q>Why, mother,</q> exclaimed her daughter, <q>there's
writing on the back!</q></p>

<p><q>My goodness! Let me look! Oh, I can't make
it out!</q> said she, after a glance at the scrawl. <q>It's
in pencil, and all smeary. Your eyes are better than
mine, child. See what it says!</q></p>

<p>The girl took the paper to the light, and read:</p>

<p><q><q>Whoever finds this body----</q></q></p>

<p>She stopped. She could make out no more.</p>

<p><q>It's written by one of them poor men!</q> said the
mother. <q>We ought to take it to the police.</q></p>

<p>She did so. A powerful lens was used, and at last
the writing was deciphered as follows:</p>

<p><q>Whoever finds this body will confer a great favour
on one who can never ask another, if he will take the
gloves the writer wears to ----, and tell her that he
died blessing her, and praying for her happiness.
And the writer asks with his dying breath ---- will
love ----, and he asks to be ---- dearly for his sake;
and he asks forgiveness from all whom he may pain
by thus going away to die, but he is too unhappy to
live. And as the last request of her dying child, he
asks his mother to love ----, and to take care of her
as far as possible; and the writer most earnestly
begs pardon from his poor old father, whom he is
sorry to leave. But Fate is too strong to resist.
May God bless all those who have been so good to me,
and whom I have so ill requited. But if my life were
to be lived again, I am afraid I should do all I have
done. As for my death, I die quite happy, and with
a blissful feeling that I am going to rest. ----</q> (probably
<pb n="221"/>
meaning his companion) <q>is nearly dead. I
have promised to see him safely dead before I quit ----</q></p>

<p>Here the writer ceased, and no doubt terminated
his own existence.</p>

<p>In each of the blanks a name had been written, and
afterwards completely defaced by the pencil, as though
the writer wished, on consideration, to avoid publicity.</p>

<p>On the same day a small medicine phial was found
near the spot, bearing the name of a chemist at
Upper Holloway. It was then ascertained, as already
mentioned, that on the evening of July 24th, the
date when the two men called at the White Lion, a
woman heard the two reports of firearms, with a very
short interval between them.</p>

<p>These were all the facts the police could discover
concerning this strange occurrence. The letter disposed
of the theory of a double murder; but it did
not solve the mystery. The question that remained
was whether the two persons had each committed
suicide, or whether one had been killed by the other
with or without his own consent, the survivor dying
afterwards by his own hand.</p>

<p>This question the surgeons could not decide. All
they could say was that the corpse lying undermost
was that of the younger person. There was a perforation,
as of a pistol shot, through the vest, a little
below the heart. But there was nothing to indicate
whether the shot had been fired with his own hand
or by that of another. He had evidently died before
his companion destroyed himself, for his face had
been carefully covered over by the rug.</p>

<p>The wound of the elder person, however, showed
plainly it had been inflicted by his own hand. He
<pb n="222"/>
had placed the pistol under the chin; the bullet had
traversed the head and came out at the crown, carrying
away a wig which the deceased wore.</p>

<p>Eventually the bodies were identified as those of
the sons of a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bittlesdon, residing in the Hornsey
Road. One of them was his son Charles, aged thirty-eight,
and the other Herbert, aged twenty-five. Both
were clerks in an insurance company.</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bittlesdon's story, if anything, added to the
puzzle. He stated they left home on Thursday, July
24th, on a fishing excursion, and then seemed to be
in their ordinary spirits. On being told to be sure
to be home in good time, one answered cheerfully:</p>

<p><q>Oh, yes, father; we shall be home at the usual
time!</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bittlesdon declared that he knew of nothing
which should have caused them to commit deliberate
suicide. He had observed no difference of late in
the conduct of either, nothing at all to explain the
matter. He was not aware that they had quarrelled.
Inquiry was made at the insurance office; but the
answer was that there was nothing wrong in their
accounts, nor had anything occurred there to explain
the act.</p>

<p>One of those perplexing discrepancies which seem
inseparable from mysteries was this:</p>

<p>The witness who found the bodies, and the surgeons
who examined them, declared, as previously mentioned,
that the body of the underneath person was
that of the younger man. On the other hand, <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Bittlesdon expressed his belief that the body which
was found underneath the other was that of his elder
son.</p>

<pb n="223"/>
<p>If, however, the surgeons' evidence is to be relied
upon--and there is no reason to doubt it--the elder
brother shot himself and was consequently the last
to die. If this were so, he must have written the letter
which was found. But <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bittlesdon once more
added a little confusion, for in his opinion the letter
was written by his younger son.</p>

<p>There was some justification for this, as a prolonged
examination of one erased name, that where the
writer says <q>---- is nearly dead,</q> showed that the
name was <q>Charles.</q> The female referred to, said
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bittlesdon, he thought was the sister of the
deceased.</p>

<p>The coroner's jury had thus to solve the riddle as
best they could, and after a long deliberation they
returned a verdict of <q><foreign xml:lang="la">Felo-de-se</foreign> against Charles
Bittlesdon, and that Herbert died of a pistol-shot
wound, by whom inflicted there was no evidence to
show.</q></p>

<p>Thus the mystery was left. In most puzzles of
this kind the motive is supplied by some love-attachment.
Old <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bittlesdon declared positively that
he was not aware that either of his sons was attached
to any young lady. This assertion is, of course, not
worth very much, as sons, especially when they are
of the age of Charles and Herbert Bittlesdon, do not
usually make their fathers acquainted with their
love affairs. To whom were the gloves referred to in
the letter to be sent?</p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bittlesdon's words were certainly guarded,
and one or two of his expressions seemed to suggest
that there was mystery lurking in the background.</p>

<p><q>Something may come out after a bit that will
<pb n="224"/>
account for it,</q> said he. And again he remarked:
<q>No doubt there was a cause, which will come out
after a time. At present it is inexplicable to me.</q></p>

<p>Did anything <q>come out after a bit</q>? Was the
mystery of this double death ever solved? Who
shall say?</p>

<head type="main">Mary Rogers</head>
<head type="sub">The Pretty Cigar Girl of New York</head>

<p>The puzzle presented by the tangled webs of the
Burdell and Nathan murders is in a way exceeded
by the hopeless blank in which the investigation
of the Mary Rogers case ended. The story
was elevated into a <foreign xml:lang="fr">cause célèbre</foreign> by the use made of
it by Edgar Allan Poe in <title>The Mystery of Marie
Roget</title>, which, together with <title>The Murders in the Rue
Morgue</title> and <title>The Purloined Letter</title>, laid the foundation
of a line of fiction which has since been pursued
with unceasing industry and ingenuity by numberless
writers and still retains its fascination.</p>

<p>Almost every New York man about town in the
year 1841 knew or had heard of Mary Cecilia Rogers,
who had made herself famous as the <q>pretty cigar
girl.</q> Her extraordinary beauty justified the name
bestowed upon her, and John Anderson, who kept a
tobacco store in the Broadway near Thomas Street,
had to thank his handsome assistant for the amazing
increase in his trade after he engaged her in 1840.
Attractive as she was, her reputation was unblemished,
and she had nothing to say to the hosts of men who
haunted the shop more with the idea of winning her
favours than of the purchase of John Anderson's
<pb n="226"/>
tobacco. Mary's mother was a woman of excellent
character, who ran a boarding house for clerks in
Nassau Street. The girl was twenty years of age
when Anderson met her and offered her an appointment
in his shop, which she accepted.</p>

<p>The mystery in which the death of Mary Rogers
is plunged began during her life. One day, in the
early summer of 1841, she was absent from the tobacco
store and was not seen again there for a week. A
good deal of curiosity was in consequence aroused,
and it was whispered that she had been seen more
than once in the company of a tall, well-dressed, dark-complexioned
man. When she returned to the store
she said she had been visiting friends in the country,
and her statement was accepted. A fresh surprise
came about when it was announced that she had
resigned her position in the Broadway shop and had
determined to go home and assist her mother. Soon
after, it was said that she was engaged to be married
to one of her mother's boarders, a young clerk named
Daniel Payne.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, July 25th, she knocked at
Payne's door and called out that she intended to pass
the day with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Downing, her cousin, who lived
in Bleecker Street. Payne promised to call for her
in the evening and bring her home. This was the
last time she was seen alive by anyone who knew her.</p>

<p>The morning was fine, but the weather changed
during the day and a violent thunderstorm with
torrents of rain broke out in the afternoon and prevented
Payne from keeping his word. He did not,
however, trouble, as he assumed Mary would be safe
at her cousin's house, where she could sleep. He went
<pb n="227"/>
to his duties as usual and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rogers thought nothing
of her daughter's absence until dinner time, when she
became very uneasy. Payne presented himself at
dinner and, finding Mary had not returned, he set
out for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Downing's house, where he was met by
the alarming information that the girl had not been
there.</p>

<p>The news spread, greatest disquietude prevailed,
and the police, being informed, started upon a search
which for several days was fruitless. On Monday,
August 2nd, the first public notice of the mystery
appeared in the <title>New York Tribune</title> as follows:</p>

<p><q>A Horrible Murder. On Sunday morning week,
Miss Cecilia Rogers (who formerly attended John
Anderson's Tobacco Store in Broadway, and was
known as <q>The Beautiful Cigar Girl</q>) left her home
in Nassau Street for a walk, and at the corner of
Theatre Alley she was met and accosted by a young
man, apparently an acquaintance, with whom she
proceeded toward Barclay Street as if for an excursion
to Hoboken. Nothing further was heard of her that
day by her friends, and alarmed by her non-appearance,
they advertised for her in Tuesday's papers.
Still nothing was seen or heard of her till Wednesday,
when <abbr>Mr.</abbr> H. G. Luther and two other gentlemen, who
were passing the Sybil's Cave near Castle Point,
Hoboken, in a sail-boat, were shocked by the sight
of the body of a young female in the water. They
brought it ashore. A coroner's inquest was summoned
and it was proved to be the body of Miss Rogers, and
it was evident that she had been horribly outraged
and murdered! The inquest returned a verdict of
murder by some person or persons unknown. We
<pb n="228"/>
understand that the deceased was a young woman
of good character and was soon to have been married
to a worthy young man of this city. It is said that
suspicion rests on a young man who has absented
himself from the city since the murder was committed.</q></p>

<p>The first part of this statement appears to have
had no foundation. There was no evidence that
she had met anybody and the assertion was never
repeated. It was probably one of the rumours which
are invariably floated in cases of murder mysteries.
Very few details were given in the newspapers. The
police and the coroner kept their inquiries to themselves,
and the reporters were faced by a blank in
every direction. Inspector Byrnes, who deals with
the affair in his <title>Professional Criminals of America</title> and
who probably had access to official records, states
that the girl's face was frightfully disfigured, and
round the waist a heavy stone was attached by a short
cord. She had been strangled by a piece of lace torn
from her dress, and the marks of cords round the
wrists were to be seen plainly. Light-coloured kid
gloves were on the hands, her bonnet was hanging
from the neck by its ribbons and the clothing was
disordered and torn.</p>

<p>The next allusion to the murder in the <title>Tribune</title> was
on August 6th. It ran:</p>

<p><q>The terrible murder of Miss Rogers excites daily
a deeper and wider interest in our city.&#x2026; A week
has passed and no clue to the perpetrator of the
awful crime been found. The police are on the alert,
but we fear too late. What has the Mayor been doing?
We hear that he waits the offer of a reward from the
<pb n="229"/>
Governor of New jersey before offering one himself.
This is wrong &#x2026; who saw Miss Rogers at Hoboken
on Sunday week? Will anyone who did and hesitates
to go before the police, please address a note stating
the facts to this office?</q></p>

<p>Nothing came of this appeal, and on August 12th
it was announced that on August 11th Daniel
Payne went to the police office <q>at the request of
Justice Parker and was subjected to a long and
tedious examination, in the course of which nothing
was elicited likely to lead to the detection of the
murderer.</q> His version as to what happened on
the occasion when he last saw her alive tallied with
the story that she left the house to go to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Downing.
The <title>Tribune</title>, in reporting Payne's examination, observed
that there was one point worthy of remark.
It appeared that he had been searching for Miss Rogers
two or three days, yet when he was informed on
Wednesday evening that her body had been found
at Hoboken, he did not go to see it or enquire into
the matter--in fact, it seems he never went at all,
though he had been there enquiring for her before.
<q>This is odd,</q> said the <title>Tribune</title>, <q>and should have
been explained.</q></p>

<p>If the authorities failed to probe deeply into the
mystery it was not for want of endeavour. The
examination at the police office on August 11th lasted
from 8 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> to 7 <abbr>p.m.</abbr> and resulted in little more than
the identification of the body as that of Mary Cecilia
Rogers. This was established beyond a doubt by
various witnesses, among whom was Alfred <choice><corr>Crommelin</corr><orig>Crommeline</orig></choice>,
at one time a boarder at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rogers' house
and a suitor of Mary, who it is said had favoured his
<pb n="230"/>
attentions but had subsequently discarded him for
Daniel Payne.</p>

<p><choice><corr>Crommelin</corr><orig>Crommeline</orig></choice>, it appears; had told <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rogers and
her daughter that should they ever be in trouble they
were to send for him. A note from <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rogers (in
Mary's handwriting) asking him to call had been left
for him on the Friday before the day of the murder,
but he did not go as he had been coldly received when
last there. On Saturday, however, the name of Miss
Rogers was written on <choice><corr>Crommelin's</corr><orig>Crommeline's</orig></choice> slate outside
his door and a rose was left in the keyhole. <choice><corr>Crommelin</corr><orig>Crommeline</orig></choice>
went over to Hoboken on the Wednesday
after the discovery Of the body, stayed till late at
night, during which time, the weather being oppressively
hot, the inquest was hurried on and the body,
buried. When <choice><corr>Crommelin</corr><orig>Crommeline</orig></choice> started to come home
the boats had ceased running. He then walked to
Jersey City, found the boats there had also stopped
and was obliged to stay overnight. This accounted
for the burial without the body having been seen
either by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rogers or Daniel Payne. The identification
was subsequently fixed by the poor girl's
clothing.</p>

<p>Henry Maltine and James M. Boullard, who found
the body floating on the water, swore that no jewellery
or rings were to be seen, though it was known that
Miss Rogers wore such trinkets. Neither was there
any rope or fastening about the body as mentioned
by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Byrnes in his version of the story. This
discrepancy must be left as it is; no explanation is
possible.</p>

<p>Then came a new sensation. Greatly to the relief
of the public mind it was announced that an arrest
<pb n="231"/>
had been made. The suspected man proved to be
a wood engraver named Joseph M. Morse, late of 129
Nassau Street. He was apprehended at West Boylston,
seven miles from Worcester, Massachusetts, on
Sunday, August 9th, having been loitering about there
for several days under an assumed name. Prior to
his arrest a letter was found in the post office at
Worcester directed to him and written from New
York, informing him of the examination and advising
him to shave off his whiskers, change his dress and
alter his appearance so as to escape detection and
arrest. When he was arrested he asked what the
charge was and, on being told for assault and battery
of his wife, he replied, <q>Oh, is that all?</q> His story
when questioned as to his whereabouts on July 25th
was somewhat contradictory. At first he said he was
at Hoboken, afterwards altering this to Staten Island.</p>

<p>Morse was described as a rather short but somewhat
strongly built man with <q>handsome black whiskers.</q>
He was neatly and fashionably dressed. His character
was not particularly good, he being the companion
of gamblers and sometimes a gambler himself. He
had been a frequenter of Anderson's tobacco stores
and knew Miss Rogers well. The evidence against
him was that he was seen with her the evening of her
death--that he was absent from home during the
night, and that the day after he had his trunks secretly
removed from his home to his office, that he fled from
New York the day after the murder, that he changed
his name while away. Finally, there was the compromising
letter of advice.</p>

<p>The American reporter of 1841 was a very different
being from his successors of twenty years later. He
<pb n="232"/>
had not then developed his <q>detective instincts</q>
which led to such confusion in the cases of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Harvey
Burdell and Benjamin Nathan. Probably it was Poe's
masterly treatment of <title>The Mystery of Marie Roget</title>
which stimulated their imaginations in murder cases
subsequent to that of Mary Rogers. At any rate,
the <title>Tribune</title> was exceedingly discreet, as will be seen
from the following editorial comment:</p>

<p><q>There are various out-of-door rumours in relation
to Morse which we cannot trace to any authentic
source and therefore withhold them from our readers.
All facts we will be careful to present, but cannot
descend to fiction to gratify even a laudable anxiety
for news.</q></p>

<p>This discretion was justified, for it turned out that
Morse really was at Staten Island with a young lady,
but that the lady in question was not Mary Rogers,
leading the <title>Tribune</title> to remark that <q>it is pretty clearly
established that the police have again been deceived--that
Morse is not the man who was seen at Hoboken
with Miss Rogers and that he is not guilty of that
charge whatever else may be his sins.&#x2026;</q> The
<title>Tribune</title> went on to say: <q>The enquiry has been thus
far confined to evidence relative to the commission
of the crime on <emph>Sunday evening</emph>. Might it not, we
ask, have been committed on Monday or Monday
evening, or even as early as Sunday before noon?
We submit these questions for the authorities to
consider.</q></p>

<p>The authorities, however, had their own methods
and one of these, as already pointed out, was extreme
secrecy. All the examinations were conducted in
private and information reached the newspapers only

by a sidewind. It was not on an official basis that
the <title>Tribune</title> told its readers that Morse stated that he
was not acquainted with Miss Rogers, but that he
firmly believed the young lady who went with him
to Staten Island was none other than Mary Rogers
herself, that after hearing of her death and the discovery
of her body he thought she had destroyed herself on
account of the treatment she had received from him,
and that he fled for fear of being accused; that he
did not discover his mistake until the young lady
with whom he was at Staten Island was brought to
him by the police.</p>

<p>Morse accordingly was set at liberty and so also
were other suspected persons, and the <title>Tribune</title> was
compelled to announce that <q>no one has been found
who saw the young lady after she left her mother's
residence on the fatal day, notwithstanding the
searching enquiries that have been made.</q></p>

<p>Then, in despair at not finding out anything by
their own unaided efforts, the authorities fell back
upon the time-honoured plan of offering a reward,
and on September 10th <abbr>Mr.</abbr> W. H. Seward, Governor
of the State of New York, issued a proclamation to
the effect that the efforts of the police to discover
the murderer of Mary Rogers having proved unsuccessful,
he offered a reward of 750 dollars <q>to be paid
to whosoever shall give information resulting in the
conviction of any person guilty of the said crime.</q>
But this effort, like all the others, proved fruitless.</p>

<p>It will be noticed in the foregoing that only the
<title>New York Tribune</title> has been quoted. Without a
doubt, the <title>Tribune's</title> contemporaries published all
they could discover concerning the mystery and
<pb n="234"/>
maybe a good deal in addition which was purely
conjectural, but, unfortunately, access to the New
York journals of 1841, other than the <title>Tribune</title>, is not
to be obtained in this country. They may exist in
the journalistic archives of the United States, but not
one is to be found in the newspaper catalogue of the
British Museum. The solitary exception is the <title>Tribune</title>.
A fair assumption is that if the authorities refused to
give reporting facilities to the <title>Tribune</title> this refusal
extended to other newspapers. The <title>Tribune</title>, although
but in the year of its birth, had established itself as
a reliable and well-conducted journal, and as such
would be in possession of every available fact. Yet
all that it could gather of so outstanding a mystery
is contained in the meagre story that we have pieced
together. A sort of sequel is given by Inspector
Byrnes, but of this sequel not one word is to be found
in the <title>Tribune</title> outside the following quotation from
the <title>New York Courier</title> of September 14th:</p>

<p><q>A <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Loss, who keeps a small tavern on the
embankment near Wukawken, has been examined
before the Mayor, and testified that Mary Rogers,
with several young men, was at her house on the
evening of July 25th and that she drank some lemonade
offered by one of them. The clothes found were
also identified by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Loss.</q></p>

<p>The statement of the <title>Courier</title> is amplified by Inspector
Byrnes to the effect that the day after the proclamation
of the reward the coroner had an anonymous
letter, the writer stating that on Sunday, the presumed
day of the murder, he had seen, while walking near
the river, a boat containing six rough-looking men
and a girl pull out from the New York side. The
<pb n="235"/>
girl was well dressed and he immediately recognised
her as Mary Rogers. The party landed on the
Hoboken side and went into the woods, the girl going
willingly with them and laughing as she went. Hardly
had they disappeared when another boat put out from
the New York bank, the occupants being three well-dressed
men. One of them landed at Hoboken and,
meeting two other men on the shore, asked if they
had seen a young woman and six men land from a
boat a few minutes before. The reply was in the
affirmative, whereupon they wanted to know whether
any force had been used to get her to go. He was
told that she had apparently gone with them willingly.
Upon this the questioner returned to the boat, which
went back to New York.</p>

<p>This letter was published in the newspapers--but
not, we may point out, in the <title>Tribune</title>--and the next
day Byrnes says the gentlemen, who had been questioned,
corroborated the story. They also knew
Mary Rogers by sight, but they were not able to say
positively the girl they saw was she. Shortly after,
came another statement which appeared to have
reference to the same story. This was made by a
stage driver named Adams, who said that on the
fatal Sunday he had seen Mary Rogers at the Bull's
Ferry in Hoboken in the company of a tall, well-dressed,
dark-complexioned man, and the two went
to a refreshment house in the Elysian Fields known
as <q>Nick Mullin's.</q> At this point the paragraph
from the <title>New York Courier</title>, quoted above, comes
into view. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Loss, the manageress, is said to have
remembered that a man resembling the one described
visited her house on the day in question, and after
<pb n="236"/>
having some refreshment, went into the woods.
Shortly after, a sound like a woman's scream was
heard coming from the woods, but <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Loss paid no
attention to it as such noises were common.</p>

<p>This narrative somehow does not wear the aspect
of truth, and as the identity of the girl was never
established it is not worthy of serious consideration.
Poe, however, utilises it, as will be seen, in his summing-up
of the case of Marie Roget. Byrnes goes on with the
final scene of the drama and with such circumstantiality
that it is advisable to quote his words. He says:</p>

<p><q>The exact spot, on which there is no doubt the
hapless girl was brutally ill-treated and then butchered,
was discovered by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Loss's little children on September
25th, exactly two months after the murder.
While playing in the woods they found, in a dense
thicket, a white petticoat, a silk scarf, a parasol, and
a linen handkerchief marked with the initials <q>M .R.</q>
The ground all round was torn up and the shrubbery
trampled as if the spot had been the scene of a terrific
struggle. Leading out of the thicket was a broad
track such as might have been made by dragging a
body through the bushes. It led in the direction of
the river, but was soon lost in the woods. All the
articles were identified as having been worn by Mary
on the day of her disappearance.</q></p>

<p>Not the slightest allusion to any part of this story
is to be met with in the <title>Tribune</title>, nor is there any record
of the statement that Daniel Payne committed suicide
in consequence of the terrible death of his betrothed.
Poe, however, adopts both stories, and on the episode
of the alleged struggle in the woods founds his conclusion
as to the fate of Marie Roget.</p>

<pb n="237"/>
<p>Unfortunately, Inspector Byrnes has omitted to
give his authority for his details. Where did he get
them? Is it possible that they, rest upon Poe's
<title>Mystery of Marie Roget</title>, for how much of Poe's
narrative depended upon facts and how much upon
his weird imagination it is, impossible to decide.
Poe's aim was to impress the reader with a sense of
veracity. He dealt with the materials after the
manner of Defoe. There is not the slightest ornamentation,
no attempt at <q>thrilling</q> writing. The
effect he desired would have been weakened thereby.
Apparently he is engaged upon a dispassionate and
critical examination of certain facts, and these facts
he purports to have taken from the newspapers.
He places the scene of the murder in Paris, gives
French names to the various characters in the tragedy
and turns the New York newspapers into Parisian
ones. Nevertheless, the real story, which he avowed
from the first, was that of Mary Cecilia Rogers, <q>the
pretty cigar girl.</q> Thus Mary Rogers becomes Marie
Roget; Daniel Payne, Jacques <abbr>St.</abbr> Eustache; Crommelin,
Beauvais; Morse, Mennais; and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Loss,
Madame Dulac. The American newspapers from
which alleged extracts are given and on which Poe,
in the character of the astute Dupin, formulates his
argument include the <title>New York Mercury</title>, the <title>New
York Brother Jonathan</title>, the <title>New York Journal of
Commerce</title>, the <title>Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post</title>,
and the <title>New York Commercial Advertiser</title>. Oddly
enough, the <title>New York Tribune</title> is not in the list. Was
this omission intentional? Whether or not, it is not
without significance that the <title>Tribune</title> contains two
statements which none of the papers quoted by Poe
<pb n="238"/>
seem to have noticed and which, if true, would have
affected his argument materially.</p>

<p>One of the statements refers to the important question
of identification. In Poe's adaptation, Beauvais
(Crommelin), in consequence of Marie's disappearance
is making enquiries on the river's bank and chances
to see a body which has just been towed ashore by
some fisherman. This body he, <q>after some hesitation,</q>
identifies as that of the missing girl. But in
the actual sequence of events Crommelin does not go
to Hoboken until <emph>after</emph> the discovery and presumably
while the hastily called inquest is proceeding. It is
not certain whether he saw the body, but it may be
presumed that he did, though there is no mention of
it in the <title>Tribune</title>. Anyway, no one else had a chance
of so doing, as in consequence of the hot weather the
burial took place the same night as already related.
Byrnes, it should be remarked, does not refer to
Crommelin at all--a somewhat curious omission
having regard to the important part he played in the
tragedy.</p>

<p>Poe is very precise in regard to the injuries to the
face and body. <q>The face was diffused with dark
blood.&#x2026; About the throat were bruises and
impressions of fingers. The arms were bent over
the chest and were rigid. The right hand was clenched,
the left partially open. On the left wrist were two
circular excoriations, apparently the effect of ropes
or of a rope in more than one volition. A part of the
right wrist also was much chafed as well as the back
throughout its extent, but more especially at the
shoulder blades.&#x2026; The flesh of the neck was
much swollen. There were no cuts apparent or bruises
<pb n="239"/>
which appeared to be the effect of blows. A piece
of lace was found tied so tightly around the neck
as to be hidden from sight; it was completely buried
in the flesh and was fastened by a knot which lay
just under the left ear.</q></p>

<p>Poe had a perfect right to go into these particulars.
Anything which assisted his imagination and which
added to the <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">vraisemblance</foreign> of his invention was
legitimate. He was dealing with fiction built on a
basis of fact, and so long as his readers were made to
believe he was telling them the truth, nothing else
mattered. But with Inspector Byrnes the case was
different. He was not entitled to go beyond ascertained
facts. He, of course, could be allowed to give
his opinion, but this opinion and the presentment
of these facts ought not to overlap. What he
has to say in regard to the injuries corresponds
in certain details to Poe's account. So much so
that one is tempted to suggest that what Poe wrote
in 1843 was made use of by Byrnes in 1881
<q>The corpse,</q> wrote the inspector, <q>was frightfully
disfigured, the face having been entirely destroyed
&#x2026; round the waist was fastened a stout cord, to
the other end of which a stone was attached. Encircling
her neck was a piece of lace torn from her dress,
tied tightly enough to produce strangulation. Sunk
deeply into the flesh of both wrists were the marks
of cords. The hands were covered with light kid
gloves, and a light bonnet hung by its ribbons around
the neck.</q> Now the extraordinary thing is that
the two men who found the girl in the river swore
that there was no rope or fastening about the body,
nor does it appear that Crommelin when identifying
<pb n="240"/>
the corpse--if he <emph>did</emph> identify it--saw anything of
the kind. But what Crommelin really saw and did
is a matter of uncertainty, and speculation in this
direction is useless. The greatest mystery of all is
that the doctor's evidence, which would have settled
everything, is not alluded to in any shape or form
by the <title>Tribune</title>. That a doctor did not see the body
and report upon it to the coroner is unthinkable. If
his evidence was put on record the newspapers had no
access to it.</p>

<p>Poe could only rely upon newspaper reports, and
one of his self-imposed tasks was to rebut the hypothesis
put forward by <title>L'Etoile</title> (his French equivalent of
the <title>New York Brother Jonathan</title>) that the body found
was not that of Marie Roget, because it was only in
the water three days at the outside, <q>since all experience
has shown that drowned bodies or bodies thrown
into the water immediately after death by violence,
require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition
to take place to bring them to the top of the water.&#x2026;
And furthermore, it is exceedingly improbable
that any villains who had committed such a murder
as is here supposed would have thrown the body in
without weight to sink it.</q> Clearly, had it been
made known that a stone was attached to it, as Byrnes
states, there would have been no necessity for the
paper's elaborate arguments. Poe opposes these arguments
at great length, but neither one side nor the
other of the controversy is material to the present
issue, especially as it may be that the ingenious writer
set up his puppet in order to knock it down, a method
now fully recognised by all writers of detective
stories.</p>

<pb n="241"/>
<p>The <q>Mystery of Marie Roget</q> is only applicable
to the Mystery of Mary Rogers in so far as it relates
to ascertained facts. What extraneous matter Poe
chose to put in to assist him in working out his thesis
is interesting as showing his mastery of technique,
but it has little direct bearing on the elucidation of
the actual mystery. One, however, turns with some
curiosity to the end of the story, not only to see the
conclusion Poe arrives at as to the fate of Marie
Roget, but to find out whether this conclusion throws
any light on the fate of Mary Rogers. This can hardly
be asserted. Poe begins by assuming that Mary's
first disappearance was in the company of a naval
officer. That the lovers quarrel and Mary returns
to her post in the tobacco shop. The quarrel is
subsequently made up and she disappears a second
time with <q>her secret lover</q> never to be seen again.
When she goes out to meet him Poe puts these thoughts
into the girl's mind: <q>I am to meet a certain person
for the purpose of elopement, or for certain other
purposes known only to myself. It is necessary that
there be no chance of interruption--there must be a
sufficient time given us to elude pursuit--I will give it
to be understood that I shall visit and spend the day
with my aunt (cousin) at the <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">Rue des Dromes</foreign> (Bleecker
Street)--I will tell <abbr>St.</abbr> Eustache (Daniel Payne) not
to call for me until dark--in this way my absence
from home for the longest possible period, without
causing suspicion or anxiety, will be accounted for
and I shall gain more time than in any other manner.
If I bid <abbr>St.</abbr> Eustache (Payne) call for me at dark he
will be sure not to call before; but if I wholly neglect
to bid him call, my time for escape will be diminished,
<pb n="242"/>
since it will be expected that I return the earlier, and
my absence will the sooner excite anxiety. Now if
it were my design to return at all--if I had in contemplation
merely a stroll with the individual in
question--it would not be my policy to bid <abbr>St.</abbr> Eustache
(Payne) call; for calling he will be <emph>sure</emph> to ascertain
that I have played him false--a fact of which I might
keep him for ever in ignorance by leaving home without
notifying hint of my intention of returning before
dark and by then stating that I had been to visit my
aunt (cousin) in the <foreign rend="roman" xml:lang="fr">Rue des Dromes</foreign>. But as it is
my design <emph>never</emph> to return--or not for some weeks--or
not until certain concealments are effected--the
gaining of time is the only point about which I need
give myself any concern.</q></p>

<p>All plausible enough, but it does not touch the crime.
It might be constructed as a theory to show that the
girl was still alive and that the body found was not
hers. Poe, however, leaves it at this point and goes
on to argue that the murder was the work of one
man and not of a gang. That the girl was attacked
by a number was an opinion held by many, supported
as they thought by the appearance of the ground near
which it was alleged <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Loss's children discovered
fragments of clothing. We have already pointed
out that, so far as we can trace, this statement is
only to be found in Inspector Byrnes's book, and as
he failed to give his authority we discard the story
as unreliable. Poe, however, adopted (or perhaps
originated) the tale and took the greatest trouble to
prove his contention that the murderer was alone.
He asks whether the traces of a struggle would not
rather demonstrate the absence of a gang. <q>What
<pb n="243"/>
<emph>struggle</emph> could have taken place--what struggle so
violent and so enduring as to have left its <q>traces</q> in
all directions--between a weak and defenceless girl
and the gang of ruffians imagined? The silent grasp
of a few rough arms and all would have been over.</q>
Poe then conjures up his powerful imagination as to
the mental condition of the solitary murderer. <q>He
is alone with the ghost of the departed,</q> we read. <q>He
is appalled by what lies motionless before him. The
fury of his passion is over and there is abundant room
in his heart for the natural awe of the deed.&#x2026; He
trembles and is bewildered. Yet there is a necessity
for disposing of the corpse.&#x2026; Consider, now the
circumstance that, in the outer garment of the corpse
when found, a strip about a foot wide had been torn
upward from the bottom hem to the waist, wound
three times round the waist and secured by a sort of
hitch in the back. This was done with the obvious
design of affording a <emph>handle</emph> by which to carry the
body. But would any <emph>number</emph> of men have dreamed
of resorting to such an expedient? To three or four
the limbs of the corpse would have afforded not only
a sufficient but the best possible hold. The device
is that of a single individual, and this brings us to the
fact that between the thicket and the river the rails
of the fences were found taken down and the ground
bore evident traces of some heavy burden having
been dragged along it! But would a <emph>number</emph> of
men have put themselves to the superfluous trouble
of taking down a fence for the purpose of dragging
through it a corpse which they might have <emph>lifted</emph> over
any fence in a moment?</q></p>

<p>We need hardly say that there is not a particle of
<pb n="244"/>
evidence in the Mary Rogers case to support this
hypothesis, but it is good reasoning in favour of Poe's
argument, and something of the kind <emph>might</emph> have
happened to Mary Rogers but for the positive statements
of the two men who found the body that there
was no rope or fastening about it.</p>

<p>Continuing the sequence of pictures conjured up
by his active brain, Poe writes: <q>My inference is
this. The solitary murderer having borne the corpse
for some distance (whether from the thicket or elsewhere)
by means of the bandage <emph>hitched</emph> round its
middle, found the weight in this mode of procedure
too much for his strength. He resolved to drag the
burden--the evidence goes to show that it was
dragged. With this object in view it became necessary
to attach something like a rope to one of the extremities.
It could be best attached about the neck where the
head would prevent it slipping off. And now the
murderer bethought him unquestionably of the bandage
about the loins. He would have used this but for its
volution about the corpse, the <emph>hitch</emph> which embarrassed
it and the reflection that it had not been <q>torn off</q>
from the garment. It was easier to tear a new slip
from the petticoat. He tore it, made it fast about
the neck and so <emph>dragged</emph> his victim to the brink of the
river.</q> The next step was to sink the body in the
river. <q>We are to understand that Marie Roget
was precipitated from a boat. This would naturally
have been the case. The corpse could not have been
trusted to the shallow waters of the shore. The
peculiar marks on the back and shoulders tell of the
bottom ribs of a boat.&#x2026; Having rid himself of
his ghastly charge the murderer would have hastened
<pb n="245"/>
to the city. There at some obscure wharf he would have
leaped on land. But the boat, would he have secured
it?&#x2026; Assuredly he would have cast it adrift.</q></p>

<p>Practically this ends the chain of investigations.
Poe, indeed, argues for the benefit of the Paris police
that all they have to do is to find this drifting boat--<q>corroboration
will rise upon corroboration and the
murderer will be traced.</q> Thus the <title>Mystery of
Marie Roget</title> is rounded off in accordance with the
demands of realistic fiction. But fiction does not
help us to piece together the facts, and in this case
the weak point is that the premises on which the
imaginative Poe founded his argument are not to be
accepted as sound. One other remark remains. A
footnote to the Marie Roget story in the 1850 edition
of Poe's works, compiled by N. P. Willis, Russell
Lowell and R. W. Griswold, runs as follows: <q>It
may not be improper to record &#x2026; that the confessions
of <emph>two</emph> persons (one of them the Madame
Dulac of the narrative) made at different periods
long subsequent to the publication confessed, in full,
not only the general conclusion but absolutely <emph>all</emph>
the chief hypothetical details by which that conclusion
was attained.</q> Two questions naturally arise out
of this statement. Is it to be taken as part of the
Defoe-ish effect aimed at by Poe, or is it to be regarded
seriously as an established fact? A safe guess would
be that the statement had to do with the <q>mystification</q>
in which Poe delighted. Anyhow, the confessions
do not appear in Snowden's <title>Ladies' Companion</title>
for 1842 in which the <title>Mystery of Marie Roget</title> was
first published. The footnote in the reprint of 1850
was probably one of Poe's afterthoughts.</p>

</argument>

<p>Each shop murder has its own features. No two
cases are exactly alike. For crafty premeditation
the murder of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rasch, the wife of a restaurant
keeper in Shaftesbury Avenue, would be difficult to
parallel. One evening about seven o'clock, an hour
when foreign restaurants are usually busy, a man
named Schmerfeld called on Carl Rasch, the husband,
whom he knew, and induced the restaurant keeper
to go out with him for a long walk. Rasch left behind
in the house his wife, the waiter, Paul Koczula, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Koczula--who was also employed on the premises--and
his four children.</p>

<p>While the children were playing in the street in
front of the house and running in and out of the door,
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Koczula suddenly presented herself in their midst
and asked one of the girls to go upstairs and play the
piano. She obeyed and the woman, saying she did
not play loud enough, banged at the keys. All
this time <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Rasch was being strangled by Koczula
in the room behind the shop and the piano-playing
<pb n="248"/>
was intended to drown her stifled cries. It is satisfactory
to know that the murderous gang was tracked
down and paid the penalty of their hideous crime.</p>

<p>The case of an elderly woman, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Squires, a general
dealer of Hoxton, had its mysterious side. She was
found strangled in a room behind the shop, there
was no evidence of robbery, but the room was disarranged
as though the murderer was on the search
for something. A significant feature bearing out this
hypothesis was the condition of an ornamental clock
which stood on the mantel-shelf. It was found
lying on its face and had been opened and tampered
with. No light was ever thrown on the tragedy.
Two cases of shop murders, one at Stepney and one
at Kilburn, have occurred of recent years, but the facts
will be within the memory of most people and need
not be gone into here.</p>

<div n="7.1" xml:id="williams" type="section">

<head type="main">John Williams</head>
<head type="sub">The Ratcliff Highway Murderer</head>

<p>The murder of the Marrs in Ratcliff Highway
stands at the head of murders in shops. It
was elevated into a classic by De Quincey, who in his
essay <title>On Murder considered as one of the Fine Arts</title>,
took the crime as his theme, and suggested possibilities
as to the dramatic side of murder of which later writers
made ample use. De Quincey's masterly treatment
of the murder of the Marrs at once rendered the
Newgate Calendar style obsolete. Mystery hung over
the crime, and had not the assassin, emboldened by
his success, proceeded to further enormities, in all
probability he would never have been detected. The
story cannot be passed over, though it may be urged
that it is slightly outside the general scheme which
we had in mind in planning the present book.</p>

<p>At <abbr>No.</abbr> 29 Ratcliff Highway, some years ago, was
a linen draper's shop kept by a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Marr. Besides
himself, his household comprised his wife, his baby,
an apprentice (a lad of fourteen), and the servant,
Margaret Jewell.</p>

<p>It was Saturday night, and the shop was, as usual,
kept open rather late. However, the shutters were
at last put up, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Marr began to think
<pb n="250"/>
about supper. They had a fancy for oysters, and
Margaret was sent out to fetch them.</p>

<p>As she left the house a singular-looking man passed
her. His complexion was almost cadaverous in its
leaden hue. The hair was of an extraordinary yellowish
tinge, the face was fringed by sandy whiskers,
and the eyes had a glazed, fixed look, which gave the
countenance a terribly sinister expression.</p>

<p>This man glanced at the servant girl as she was
hurrying by, and the look somehow filled her with
dread. She determined to go back to the house as
quickly as she could; but this was not so easy, for
the first oyster shop was closed and she had to go to
another one. Altogether she was away about twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>After <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Marr had put up the shutters--in which
operation a watchman passing on his beat lent him
a hand--he left the door open, and Margaret Jewell
expected to find it ajar when she returned. To her
surprise it was closed and locked.</p>

<p>In a state of agitation for which she could not
account, she both rang and knocked. There was no
reply. She knocked again, and tried to listen for
some signs of movement. She could hear nothing,
and the silence seemed to instil her with an icy horror.</p>

<p>Again she violently rang the bell, and listened with
beating heart. Maybe her terror intensified her sense
of hearing, for she could not only distinguish footsteps,
but she felt convinced they were not the footsteps of
either her mistress or master. Nor did the footsteps
ascend from the kitchen, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Marr would
most likely be. She heard them on the stairs leading
to the bedrooms above--a stealthy, creeping sound.</p>

<pb n="251"/>
<p>The sounds gradually became a little louder. The
footsteps were descending and not ascending the stairs.
They came nearer to the door--so near, indeed, that
the girl could hear the noise of someone breathing.</p>

<p>She seized the bell-pull and gave it one violent
despairing jerk, and then rushed to the door of the next
house full of a sickening fright. In the next house
lived <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murray, a pawnbroker. Jumping out of
bed, he hurried down, half-dressed, and heard the
girl's story. Seizing a poker, he ran into the back-yard,
with the intention of breaking into the Marr's house.</p>

<p>Over the wall he went, and there saw the back
door of Marr's house wide open. A candle was burning
in the room at the back of the shop. He entered the
silent house, and on reaching the shop started back
in horror. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Marr was lying dead, with a horrible,
gaping wound in his throat and his head smashed in.
A few yards further on were the bodies of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Marr
and the apprentice. They had been killed in a ghastly
and barbarous fashion.</p>

<p>Murray instantly raised the alarm. A crowd rushed
into the house, made further search, and in the kitchen
found a smashed cradle, and underneath, the poor
little baby, also a corpse.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes a whole family had been
hurried out of existence and murdered in a ghastly
and barbarous fashion. Why the poor little child
should have been murdered it is impossible to explain.</p>

<p>The motive of the murderer, it is clear, was robbery,
for though he had only taken a couple of sovereigns
there was £150 in the house for which he had not
time to search. Margaret Jewell had come back
too soon and hindered him in his work.</p>

<pb n="252"/>
<p>In so great a hurry had the murderer taken his
departure that he left behind him what promised to
be a most important clue, had the authorities pursued
only ordinary steps.</p>

<p>This clue consisted of a ship's carpenter's mallet,
and on the mallet were pricked two letters--<q>J. P.</q>
Stupidly enough, while a description of the mallet
was issued, these two letters were not mentioned,
and so nothing at first came of the enquiry.</p>

<p>In the meantime London was in a complete state
of panic. There was something so completely atrocious
in the deed and so stealthy and crafty in its execution
that a wave of terror went over the metropolis, and
even spread to distant country places. Scores of men
were arrested on suspicion and discharged, The
tramps on every great road in the kingdom were taken
into custody and detained. Vigilance associations
were formed, and a strict watch was kept at every
seaport over persons setting out on voyages.</p>

<p>For eleven days nothing else was talked or thought
of but the murder of the Marrs, and underlying this
was a terrible presentiment that the monster who
had perpetrated one wholesale murder would not
stop in his vile career.</p>

<p>On the evening of Thursday, twelve days after the
tragedy at <abbr>No.</abbr> 29 Ratcliff Highway, Mr. Williamson,
the landlord of the King's Head, a public house at the
corner of New Gravel Lane, which turns out of Ratcliff
Highway, noticed a man roaming about the
passages on the ground floor.</p>

<p><q>What are you doing here?</q> asked the landlord.</p>

<p>The man made some incoherent reply and retreated
to the taproom. This was about seven o'clock in
<pb n="253"/>
the evening. About half-past seven this man left the
taproom and went out of the house. He came back
about nine and sat in a corner of the room, without,
however, taking part in the general conversation.
This man was noticeable by the leaden hue of his
countenance and his bright yellow hair.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Williamson came into the
taproom and said he was going to close the house.</p>

<p><q>It's time for all you fellows to be off home,</q> said
he.</p>

<p>One by one they went out, the yellow-haired man
among the number.</p>

<p>Although the landlord had practically shut up so
far as the drinking on the premises was concerned, he
kept his door open, as the neighbours frequently sent
for beer after his closing hour.</p>

<p>There happened to be a man lodging at the King's
Head named Turner, a journeyman carpenter. Turner,
who rose early, went to bed early, but was not able
to sleep. He was in the neighbourhood of the murder
of the Marrs, and the ghastly tragedy had fixed itself
in his mind. He lay tossing and turning, uneasy and
restless.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard the street door fiercely shut to.
He started up in bed, oppressed with a nameless fear.
It was then half-past eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>In an instant the whole scene of the murder of the
Marrs and the method pursued by the assassin came
with horrible vividness before his mind's eye, and he
was bathed in an icy perspiration. A minute of
agonised suspense, and he stole from his bed, though
why he did so and what he was going to do he did
not know.</p>

<pb n="254"/>
<p>He crept noiselessly on to the landing and leaned
over the rails of the staircase. There he heard sounds
which appalled him. That which stuck in his memory
was the terror-stricken cry of a girl, followed by the
broken accents of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williamson:</p>

<p><q>We shall all be murdered!</q></p>

<p>The words fell like the blows of a hammer upon
his heart. He knew not what to do, yet some horrible
fascination drew him onward. He descended a stair
or two and then heard the sound of repeated blows,
and the tragic cry:</p>

<p><q>I'm a dead man!</q></p>

<p>Then followed one faint, prolonged wail, and all was
silent.</p>

<p>Though he might be going to his own death Turner
could not resist descending the staircase. He was
attracted to the scene of murder as though he was
under the influence of some horrible spell. Step by
step he went down, and at last was sufficiently near
the room to see through the doorway. A terrible
sight met his eye.</p>

<p>On the floor were lying the dead bodies of the landlord
and his wife. He could hear the sound of a man's
footsteps, and now and again the jingle of keys. The
murderer was evidently trying the various locks. Once
the murderer came to where <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williamson was lying
dead, and put his hand in her pocket and took from
it another bunch of keys. The first bunch, apparently,
had not enabled him to open the various cupboards
and drawers.</p>

<p>Had the murderer chanced to look through the doorway
he would have seen the white face of the solitary
witness outside. But he was absorbed in his ghastly
<pb n="255"/>
work, and he stepped behind the door where there was
a sideboard.</p>

<p>Turner saw the miscreant distinctly. He saw his
bright yellow hair and his corpse-like face. He
appeared to be dressed in a tight-fitting suit, the
better, no doubt, to elude capture. The horrified
witness could have screamed with terror had not his
tongue clove to the roof of his mouth.</p>

<p>With the disappearance of the murderer Turner's
consciousness returned. He recognised that his fate
might also be that of the Williamsons, and, turning,
he fled noiselessly to his own room.</p>

<p>In another apartment on the same floor Williamson's
grandchild, a girl of twelve or thirteen, was sleeping,
but he had no time to think of her. There was also
a maidservant in the house, but where she was Turner
did not know.</p>

<p>All his thought now was to escape from that blood-stained
house. The window was his only resource.
He put his head outside. A dense fog prevailed,
and he could scarcely see a yard before him. How
far he had to drop he did not know. Then he rushed
to his bed, tied the sheets together with feverish haste,
and dragged the bedstead to the window. Tying
his rope to the post, he lowered himself.</p>

<p>A few stragglers who were going home late that
night in Ratcliff Highway were astounded to see a
figure dangling at the end of a white rope. The man
was some twelve or fourteen feet from the ground.</p>

<p><q>What are you doing there?</q> shouted one
fellow.</p>

<p>Turner could only answer with an inarticulate cry,
but it was a cry of unmistakable terror, and, the man
<pb n="256"/>
below shouting for help, a crowd soon collected, and
down dropped the trembling young fellow.</p>

<p>Then in a gurgling voice he gasped out, while his
trembling finger pointed at the house:</p>

<p><q>Marr's murderer is in there at work.</q></p>

<p>The words were electrical. They spread from mouth
to mouth. The news was taken up in the main
thoroughfare, in the side streets, in the courts and
alleys. People rushed half dressed out of their houses.
Soon a wild, surging mob crowded round the house
shouting for vengeance.</p>

<p>Blows began to thunder on the door, and there was
the sound of the crashing and splintering of wood.
Then the chief constable, who had arrived on the
scene, took charge of the proceedings.</p>

<p><q>Hold your row!</q> he shouted. <q>If you are silent
we shall hear the villain and know in what part of the
house he is!</q></p>

<p>In an instant there came a dead hush over the surging
multitude, all the more dramatic by reason of its
contrast with the shrieks of fury which had preceded
it. In the midst of that silence came the noise of the
smashing of glass. It proceeded from the back of
the house.</p>

<p>A mad dash was made by the avenging crowd.
They burst in the door and rushed up the staircase.
One of the bedroom doors was locked. In a twinkling
it was smashed in, and at the moment a man hurled
himself from the window, crashing through the glass
and the frame.</p>

<p>He disappeared in the dense fog, and an angry yell
went up from the baffled pursuers, for at the back of
the house was a large piece of vacant ground which
<pb n="257"/>
had been cleared for the extension of the London
Docks.</p>

<p>Once more had the murderer escaped.</p>

<p>His second crime was no less atrocious than the
first. Besides <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williamson, the poor
maidservant was found in the kitchen, a corpse. She
had been laying the fire for the following morning,
and was struck down as she was kneeling on the hearth.</p>

<p>The terror of the metropolis now arose to a perfect
frenzy. Never was there such a panic, never such a
universal search. Carts and carriages, waggons and
vehicles of every kind, boats on the river, were stopped
and examined, every house in the neighbourhood
was ransacked, but in vain. A reward of £1,500
was offered by the Government and by the parish of
<abbr>St.</abbr> George's-in-the-East.</p>

<p>By this time it occurred to somebody in authority
that it might be as well to amend the description of
the mallet left behind in the Marr's house and accordingly
fresh bills were issued giving the letters <q>J. P.</q>
And these letters, in the most unexpected way, led
to the discovery of the villain.</p>

<p>It so happened that the landlord of the Pear Tree
public house, Shadwell, was in prison for debt, and
while there read the description of this mallet.</p>

<p><q>Why,</q> he exclaimed, <q>that tallies exactly with
the mallet which was left at my house with some other
tools by a Norwegian carpenter. His name was
John Petersen.</q></p>

<p>This was very significant, for the initials on the
mallet were identical with the initials of John Petersen.
The man also recollected another important fact.
Among his lodgers, soon after Petersen left, was a
<pb n="258"/>
man named John Williams, a sailor, and John Williams
had a face of cadaverous hue and bright yellow hair.</p>

<p>This information was sufficient for the police officers,
who immediately went to the Pear Tree and apprehended
Williams. He was at once brought up for
preliminary examination, a huge crowd thronging the
court and another still larger howling and yelling
outside.</p>

<p>In the pocket of a waistcoat worn by Williams was
found a French knife of peculiar construction, exceedingly
sharp. Now it was stated by the surgeon who
examined the bodies that some weapon other than a
razor had been used, and this French knife was a very
possible instrument for the perpetration of such
murders.</p>

<p>It was also shown that after the murder of the
Marrs, Williams cut off his whiskers. Significant
also was another incident. About half-past one on
the night of the first murder he came into his bedroom,
where also slept some Germans. The Germans were
reading in bed.</p>

<p><q>For Heaven's sake put out that light!</q> growled
Williams fiercely, <q>or something will happen!</q></p>

<p>The next morning a fellow lodger told him about
the murder.</p>

<p><q>I know it!</q> he said surlily.</p>

<p>This was, to say the least, remarkable, for he was
at that time in bed and had not been out for anyone
to tell him the news.</p>

<p>A tremendous crowd assembled to see him taken
to the court for his second examination, but they were
disappointed. The murderer had hanged himself the
night before in Coldbath Fields Prison.</p>

<pb n="259"/>
<p>John Williams, one of the most atrocious criminals
in the annals of crime, thus cheated the hangman.</p>

<p>It is a curious thing that, despite his blood-thirstiness
and callous heart, he had a peculiarly soft voice. At
his first examination he asked the daughter of one of
the witnesses, called to identify him, whether she
would be afraid if she woke up at night and found
him standing at her bedside. Her answer was:</p>

<p><q>Not if I knew it was you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Williams.</q></p>

<p>Williams received the penalty meted out not so
many years ago to a suicide. He was buried at a
crossroads--in this case, at the point where the New
Road crosses the end of Ratcliff Highway, and Cannon
Street Road begins--and a stake was driven through
his body. Sir Thomas Lawrence made a water-colour
sketch of the miscreant, which for some years was to
be seen at the Room of Horrors at Madame Tussaud's
and may be there still.</p>

<pb n="260"/>
<head type="main"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville</head>
<head type="sub">Slough's Black Secret</head>

<p>Less terrible but more mysterious than the murder
of the Marrs was that of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville, the butcher's
wife, at Slough. Nothing could be less suggestive of
crime than the unpretending shop in the High Street
of a sleepy town, yet within a few minutes the weapon
of death descended and the wielder had vanished as
though he had never been.</p>

<p>Imagine a shop about 18 feet by 12 feet, in the centre
of which stood a chopping block and to the left of
the entrance a counter on which the scales were kept.
Behind was a fairly large room, between which and the
shop was a door and with a window commanding the
entire view of the front premises. Immediately beneath
this window was a desk at which <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville was in
the habit of sitting to post and make up the accounts.
Behind her and a little to the left in the middle of
the room was a table covered by a green ornamental
cloth. At the back of the room, also a little to the
left, a door led into a yard, which door could be opened
from the inside but not from the outside. Close to
this door a window looked into the yard. This
window was fitted with a blind, but it was not drawn
down on the evening in question. A kitchen could
<pb n="261"/>
be entered from the room just described, the door of
communication being just behind where <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville
would sit. A gas burner was placed close to the small
window, immediately to the right of the head of
a person sitting at the desk, and a second burner was
in the shop; the tap of the latter was half turned
down on the evening in question and the light was
but dim. There was no access from the back of the
house.</p>

<p>It is essential to bear in mind the arrangement of
the premises as it shows that no one could enter the
room from the rear; while any person coming into
the shop from the street would be at once seen by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Reville. The inmates of the house were <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville and two children. The assistants in the
business were a boy, Frederick Glass, and Augustus
Payne, a youth of eighteen. Both had been in the
employ of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reville some two years.</p>

<p>It was the night of April 11th, 1881. Business
was over for the day, and at about ten minutes past
eight <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reville left the house to pay a few calls
and gossip with his cronies after the fashion of the
country tradesman. He left his wife sitting in her
usual seat at the desk in the room behind the shop
posting up her account books, and the lad, Frederick
Glass, was helping her. Augustus Payne was in the
shop and the two children were upstairs in bed. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Reville and the boy continued to work until five-and-twenty
minutes past eight, when the boy prepared
to go. Meanwhile, Payne had come from the shop
and had passed through the room into the kitchen.
As a rule, Glass and Payne went away together, but
on that night Payne told Glass he might be a quarter of
<pb n="262"/>
an hour later as he had to rub salt into some hams.
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville put twopence on the table and Glass
and Payne each took a penny. Then Glass took his
leave, Payne remaining behind.</p>

<p>The time at which Payne left depends upon his
own word. There was no corroborative evidence.
He came out of the kitchen, and as he crossed the
room <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville bade him good night. <q>I asked
her,</q> said Payne, <q>if I should shut the shop door
and she said <q>No; turn the gas down and leave it
open.</q> It was 8.32 when I came out of the door.
I looked at the clock.</q></p>

<p>If Payne's word as to the time he left the house
is to be depended upon, what happened next must
have occupied no more than a couple of minutes or
so. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Beasley, who lived next door to the Revilles,
was in the habit of looking in every evening to keep
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville company after the boys had left, and on
the night of April 11th she went in as usual. The
shop door was a little way open and the time was,
she thought, about half-past eight, but she could not
be sure to five minutes. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville was in her
accustomed seat, as <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Beasley could see when she
looked through the window. There was something
strange about her appearance. Her face was of a
leaden pallor. The poise of the head was wrong.
Considerably alarmed, the visitor went a little nearer.
She at first thought <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville had fainted. Then
she caught sight of an ominous red streak in her neck
and she could not go a step further by herself. She
ran out of the shop for assistance.</p>

<p>Either before <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Beasley entered or while she was
away other eyes had seen the terrible sight. Those
<pb n="263"/>
eyes belonged to one of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville's children, a little
tot of five years old. She was very thirsty, and not
being able to sleep she went downstairs, and while on
the staircase heard the sound of a door slamming.
She reached the door opening into the room at the
back of the shop, peeped in and saw her mother sitting
in front of her desk. The child spoke, but getting no
answer went a little nearer and then saw blood on
her mother's neck. Trembling with fright she ran
upstairs and got into bed, where she lay, not daring
to utter a sound, until the next morning when she told
her father. She also said she heard a noise as of her
mother choking. If so, this would fix the time of the
child's entrance as <emph>before</emph> the visit of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Beasley.</p>

<p>In the meantime, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Beasley had poured a somewhat
incoherent tale into the ears of a neighbour, a
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Light, who at once started for the Revilles'
shop. He could not tell the exact time, but his wife
put it at twenty-five minutes past eight, but the clock
it turned out was slow. When Light saw <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Reville he knew she was dead. Within a few minutes
Police-sergeant Hobbs was on the scene, and it was
then a quarter to nine. Hobbs saw a large wound
on the side of the neck and two wounds on the front
of the head. On the table were some papers, a chopper
and some bread and cheese. The handle of the chopper
was from the dead woman nearest the back door.
Both the back doors were shut, but he could not say
whether they were fastened. Seeing no blood on the
upper part of the chopper, he took it up and found the
underside covered with blood, wet and running and
with hair upon it. Some pieces of money--a penny,
a halfpenny, and a shilling--were lying partly on
<pb n="264"/>
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville's dress, and her handkerchief was partly
in and partly out of her pocket.</p>

<p>What the surgeon found pretty well told how the
murderer went about his work. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville was
sitting on the forepart of the chair and leaning back.
The two severe wounds on the forepart of the head
were probably caused by blows from someone standing
behind, and by such an instrument as the chopper.
The blows had been delivered from right to left. It
is important to note that no blood was found on the
floor where anyone would have been standing, so that
the assassin might have escaped without having any
blood on his clothing.</p>

<p>A singular piece of writing was found on the table.
On a half sheet of notepaper was the following:</p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville--You will never sell me any more
bad meat like you did on Saturday. I told <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Austin at Chalvey that I should do for her. I have
done it for the bad meat she sold me on Saturday.
--H. Collins, Colnbrook.</q></p>

<p>If this paper was intended to throw the police off
the scent the method adopted was palpably absurd.
Enquiries, of course, were made, but as might be expected
they led to nothing. At the same time it was
significant that whoever wrote the words must have
known something of the Revilles' business. It turned
out that though H. Collins was not known at Colnbrook
there was a Robert Collins living at Chalvey,
and Robert Collins was one of Reville's customers.
He, however, had not written the note nor did he
know anything of any bad meat. It was true also
that at Chalvey lived a <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Elizabeth Austin, but
<pb n="265"/>
she knew no H. Collins and no one of that name had
complained to her of bad meat.</p>

<p>So much for the alleged motive. The police could
find out no one who had a grudge against <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville,
and though it was not proved that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville had
much money in her pocket at the time she was attacked,
whatever was the amount it was gone. Murder for
the sake of robbery was hardly likely, though, of
course, it could be urged that a stranger would not
know what money the poor woman had about her
and might be tempted to take his chance. But there
were powerful objections to this supposition. The
shop door it is true was open, but no one could enter
without being seen by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville from her seat at
the desk. Moreover, the murderer when he struck
the fatal blows was <emph>behind</emph> his victim. Is it conceivable
that a strange man could enter the room without
some protest from <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville and could swiftly
leap behind her and not be seen? If she <emph>did</emph> see him
her natural instinct would have prompted her to get
up from her chair, either to call for assistance or to
escape from some threatened danger. But when
discovered dead the attitude of her body was unchanged
from that of life. Nor was there the slightest sign of
a struggle.</p>

<p>The distinctive features of this singular case are
firstly, the amazing swiftness of the murderer, and
secondly, that he should have escaped without bloodstained
clothing. Payne was the last to leave the shop
and he fixed the time at 8.32. Shortly afterwards he was
met in the street by one witness who thought the time
was about five-and-twenty minutes to nine. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Beasley went into the shop at half-past eight or
<pb n="266"/>
thereabouts. Obviously, the difficulty of fixing by
the memory alone the exact moment of every particular
occurrence is insuperable. All that can be
said is that these three times probably ranged within
the limit of five minutes, and one is justified in assuming
that the entry of the murderer, the attack, the robbery
and his escape, did not occupy more than this brief
interval. It was probably less, for although the child
who crept into the room while outside the door heard
a noise as of someone, she saw nothing when she
peeped into the room but the sight of her mother
and the blood on her neck. By this time the deed
was done and the murderer had fled.</p>

<p>The second feature of the crime--the absence of any
clue from bloodstained clothing--is equally puzzling.
The miscreant had inflicted upon his victim four
terrible wounds and one appeared to have received
two blows. The surgeon was of opinion that the
wounds at the back of the head were first delivered
and the effect would be to cause immobility. The head
being thrown back the other blows were more consistent
with being given from behind than from any other
direction. He thought it was quite possible there
was not much spurting of blood, but if the person
were standing behind he should have expected the
person would have been covered with blood. Still
he could have rifled the woman's pockets and yet be
free from blood had he proceeded <emph>very carefully</emph>.</p>

<p>No doubt, but this presupposes deliberation, and
the murder was consummated so rapidly that there
could have been no time for deliberation. Considering
that the crime was determined upon, it is possible, however,
that the murderer, finding the woman was made
<pb n="267"/>
unconscious by his first blow, robbed her and finished
his appalling work afterwards. The deed was no
haphazard one and hence the perpetrator had an eye
to the avoidance of bloodstains.</p>

<p>A third puzzle--that relating to the chopper--must
not be overlooked.</p>

<p>The weapon used to commit the murder was undoubtedly
the butcher's chopper. This chopper was
always kept on the block in the shop. How came
it into the room? Did the murderer catch sight of
it as he passed as a ready instrument for his purpose?
Was it by accident, or had he planned out his deed
beforehand and noted where the chopper was kept?
Frederick Glass did not notice when he left the house
at twenty-five minutes past eight whether the chopper
was in its place. Alfred Payne, his fellow assistant,
told the coroner that when he left at thirty-two minutes
past eight the chopper, with other tools, was on the
block, except the knife, and that laid against the
weights close to the scales. Save Payne's, there was
no other evidence relating to the chopper.</p>

<p>For certain reasons which will be gone into presently,
the police came to the conclusion that the murder
was committed by someone well acquainted with the
business. The boy Glass was at once eliminated
from their conclusions and so also was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reville,
who was at a neighbouring tavern at the time of the
murder. There remained Alfred Augustus Payne.
Now, some curious discoveries were made in regard
to the note signed <q>H. Collins</q> which seem to direct
suspicion towards Payne, so much so that, while the
coroner's inquest was being held, the police kept the
youth under a species of surveillance.</p>

<pb n="268"/>
<p>This suspicion rested upon more grounds than one.
When <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reville went out at a quarter to eight, he
left Payne in a corner of the shop writing on a sheet
of paper. On searching the shop and room the police
superintendent found a piece of notepaper which,
on being compared with the letter addressed to Mrs.
Reville left on the table, was found to correspond.
A notch on the side of one fitted into the side of the
other. This coincidence suggested that, in addition
to doing the woman to death, the murderer found
time to write the note in question. The watermark
also corresponded.</p>

<p>The important point was to establish whose was
the handwriting. Asked for specimens of his handwriting
Payne gave them willingly, and these specimens,
together with the letter signed <q>H. Collins,</q> were
submitted to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Chabot, a well-known writing expert.
But the expert's evidence was like the evidence of
most experts in such cases, very unsatisfactory. He
found more similarities in handwritings which were
proved not to be Payne's than in those that were.
Before the coroner <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Chabot was much more positive
that the handwriting of the letter addressed to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Revile resembled that of Payne than he was at the
assizes.</p>

<p>The question of the handwriting was left unsettled
at the inquest, and left as it was, it tended to cast a
shadow over Payne's protestation of innocence. This
shadow was deepened when it was inferred from certain
evidence given by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reville that Payne might have
nursed a grudge against <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville. The latter, it
appeared, had some weeks before told her husband
that there was something wrong in regard to some
<pb n="269"/>
money being missed and that if he did not get rid of
Payne she would. <q>She calculated,</q> said Reville,
<q>that he was robbing us.</q></p>

<p>Much was made of the superintendent's statement
that when Payne was taken to the scene of the murder
he showed no emotion, but as every student of psychology
knows, the absence of outward emotion
proves nothing. In such a case as Payne's it tells as
much in favour of innocence as of guilt. However,
the cumulative effect of all that told against Payne
was that thirteen of the coroner's jury returned a
verdict of wilful murder against Payne and he was
committed to the assizes.</p>

<p>The trial disclosed nothing more than has already
been related. The right of a prisoner to give evidence
if he wished to do so had not then been established,
and Payne's mouth was closed. What he told the
coroner, however, may be quoted, as it tallied exactly
with his statement to the police superintendent. It
ran: <q>I am innocent of the crime and knew nothing
in the least about it till <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dunham came to my
house. He asked me to go to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reville's to see
whereabouts <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville was sitting when I left her.
From what I left her at thirty-two minutes past eight
she did not seem to have moved an inch. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reville
says I had some ill feeling against <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville and I
had not the least. Two never could agree better
than me and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Reville. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reville says I have
been in the habit of going to public houses for the last
two months and I have not. I gave it up ever since
he told me. I should not have gone then had it not
been for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reville. I don't see why he should put
upon me, calling me such a bad boy after giving me
<pb n="270"/>
so many presents as he has. That's all I've got to
say.</q></p>

<p>He never went from these words; he was never
confused, and throughout the trial he maintained-his
self-possession. The police tried to make out that
when Payne was taken to the scene of the murder
he showed no sign of emotion, but this he strongly
denied. He nearly fell down at the sight, he said,
and would have done so but for his supporting himself
by laying his hand on the block.</p>

<p>The jury were not long in finding Payne not guilty,
and it is difficult to see how they could come to any
other conclusion. The whole tragedy was so inexplicable
and so motiveless--in spite of the self-implicating
letter--that one can discover no point to start
from even to piece out a theory. The Slough shop murder
must in the absence of any belated confession--a
most unlikely thing to happen now that over forty
years have passed since the deed was committed--for
ever remain one of the darkest of Unsolved
Mysteries.</p>

<head type="main">The Tragedy of Chung Ong</head>

<p>America can boast of a shop atrocity which in
its horror and unrestrained savagery would be
hard to parallel. The deed was perpetrated in the
broad daylight during a busy hour, there were business
premises above and on each side, yet the assassin
completed his butchery unheard and unsuspected.
Robbery there was it is true, but a deeper motive
than this lurks behind. The victim was a Chinaman
restaurant keeper, and in its principal features the
case suggests the craft, the silence, and the lust of
blood which belong to the East. It is not to be
wondered at that the police could make nothing of
it. What adds to the mystery was that the murder
of Chung Ong--trading under the name of Antonio
Soloa--was but one of a series of similar crimes, none
of which could be traced to its source.</p>

<p>The basement of an old brick building on the
south-east corner of Spring and Worcester Streets,
New York, was hired in July 1885 by a mild-looking
Chinaman, who fitted it up as a restaurant. He
probably knew where to look for customers and
probably had a good connection among his countrymen.
Otherwise it is hard to conceive how he could
expect to run a business of the kind he carried on.
The approach to this underground shop was poverty-stricken
and uninviting. One had to descend a flight
<pb n="272"/>
of stone steps to get to it and there was nothing about
the entrance to invite one to enter. For all that,
Chung Ong, known as Antonio Soloa, did a good trade
and, thanks to his thriftiness, made money.</p>

<p>Once inside the restaurant you saw before you
in its front part four tables, with room for twenty
diners. Two canary birds were in brass wire cages
hanging from the ceiling. On the walls were several
Chinese prints and a photograph of Chung Ong. In
the rear were thin partitions enclosing a kitchen and
a bedroom.</p>

<p>Chung Ong's customers were mostly Chinamen who
worked in cigar factories in the neighbourhood. Ong
had himself been a cigar maker in Cuba ten years
before and most of his customers had also been employed
in Cuba. There was a good deal of routine
attached to the business. The customers breakfasted
every morning at the restaurant and did not appear
again until the evening. Very little was doing in the
middle of the day, and Ong usually closed his place
at this time and went out for a walk. He occupied
the little bedroom at the back of the restaurant at
night. A young, sickly-looking Chinaman was employed
as a waiter, but about three weeks before the
tragedy we are about to recount he disappeared, and
during his absence Ong did everything for himself.</p>

<p>Nothing happened to cause any foreboding; the
restaurant was quietly conducted, and when Thomas
Daly, a vegetable vendor, descended the stone steps
about 2.30 <abbr>p.m.</abbr> on November 2nd, he had no suspicion
that anything was amiss. He noticed, however,
that a pane had been broken in the window of the glass
door and that the pieces were scattered on the floor
<pb n="273"/>
inside. The door was partly open and Daly entered.
He shouted, <q>Do you want any ----</q> but the word
<q>cabbages</q> died away on his lips, for glancing towards
the door leading to the bedroom, he saw Chung Ong's
body lying in a pool of blood on the floor.</p>

<p>Daly was too frightened to examine further and
ran for the police. A posse were soon on the spot
and it was discovered that a murder of terrible
atrocity had been committed. The man's head had
been crushed as though with heavy weights, there
were hideous wounds in the chest, the walls and
furniture were spotted with blood.</p>

<p>The bed in the little room was found littered with
boxes and various articles. A trunk had been opened
and rifled. On some of the things were marks of
bloody fingers. The money drawer under the counter
in the restaurant had been torn from its supports
and was lying empty on the floor. Ong's pockets
had been searched by blood-smeared fingers and his
empty wallet lay on a table. Near the door was a
wash-basin half full of blood-stained water, and a
towel, showing that the murderer had hastily removed
the traces of his crime before he left the place.</p>

<p>One need not go into the details of the wounds and
mutilations. They were too revolting. It will be
enough to say that they exhibited all the ferocity
which characterises the Asiatic murderer. The puzzle
was how such a deed could have been committed in
the middle of the day without attracting attention.
The floor above the restaurant was occupied and
business premises were on each side. Certainly there
was no cry of any kind, indicating that Ong was taken
by surprise and struck down without the slightest
<pb n="274"/>
chance of raising his voice. It is true that Ryder,
a plumber who lived next door, heard a smashing of
glass and sent his boy to see what was the matter,
but nothing came of it. The boy glanced down the
stone steps but did no more. Had he descended the
staircase he would have seen the broken window in
the door, and had curiosity stimulated him to look
through the opening the murderer might have been
revealed to him. But as it was the miscreant was
undisturbed at his work and easily made good his
escape.</p>

<p>What was the motive? At first it was assumed
that it must have been robbery, but this theory does
not entirely meet the case. An ordinary robber
does not, after despatching his victim, proceed to
stab and hack the body after death. He might have
been actuated by spite, but if so, it is fair to assume
that he visited Ong on murder intent and armed with
some weapon which would serve his purpose speedily.
But he appears to have trusted to chance and made
use of what he could find in the place. The body
wounds were inflicted with the broad-bladed bread
knife belonging to the establishment, and the head
was battered with heavy weights from the restaurant
scales. Nothing had been left behind to give the
police the slightest clue.</p>

<p>Naturally, the enquiry was directed towards finding
out who had last seen the Chinaman alive. It appears
that about noon of the day of the murder he was in
his kitchen and bustling about as usual when Julius
Dichong, a countryman of his who had known him
for ten years, went down to dine. Only one table
was then occupied. The diners at it paid their score
<pb n="275"/>
and went out. A little before one Dichong left. Ong
was then standing near the canaries feeding them.
About an hour later, before two, John Wauchus, a
member of a grocery firm occupying the floor above
the restaurant, was going out of his store when he
met Ong coming up the steps. Ong had turned the
key in the door, and as he returned the grocer's nod
he said: <q>I'm going over to the Bowery to see someone.</q>
As he spoke he turned in that direction and
Wauchus never again saw his Chinese neighbour alive.</p>

<p>Ong, or Soloa, was a quiet, affable sort of a man.
He dressed rather well for a Chinaman, discarding
all the native gear with the exception perhaps of an
alabaster bracelet, and he wore his hair like his neighbours,
without a suspicion of its having ever been
trussed up in a queue. He appeared to be on the
best terms with his customers and was altogether
a good-natured, hard-working fellow. The absence
of any personal reason why he should have been put
out of the world reminded people of two strange
outrages of a similar character, and it was surmised
that Ong had incurred the anger of some Chinese
secret society. It was now remembered that on
January 6th, 1883, Loo Sing, a Chinese laundryman,
was murdered in his laundry at Clinton Street, New
York. Fifteen stab wounds were found in his back
and there was abundant proof that his murderer had
also robbed the place. The police were not able to
fasten the crime upon anyone, although they arrested
several Chinamen on suspicion. In December 1884,
Hang Chang, a Newark laundryman, was hacked
with knives in a frightful manner and hung up by the
neck in his laundry by two Chinamen who robbed
<pb n="276"/>
his till and escaped. Chang was discovered and cut
down alive. He also recovered, though he had received
wounds enough to kill more than one white man, and
he was able to assist the police in tracking the robbers.
Sing, one of the ruffians, was arrested, and after
confessing his guilt was sent to prison for seven years.
It was ascertained that Sing, who had accompanied
the <title>Jeannette</title> Expedition to the Polar Seas as cook,
belonged to a band of desperate Chinamen. Sing's
companions were believed to have committed the
Clinton Street murder, but the police were not able
to catch any of them. It was considered probable
that one or more of the same ruffians killed Ong in
his restaurant.</p>

<p>A story was then put about to the effect that any
Chinaman who came to America bound himself to
the Chinese Six Companies, first to obey under all
circumstances the law of the Imperial Chinese Government,
and next, those of the Six Companies. The
penalty of disobedience to these laws was the enslavement
of his family in China or the forfeiture of his
life if he had no family at home. It was further
asserted that it was no uncommon thing for a Chinaman
to disappear in San Francisco or to be butchered
in cold blood, and that the Chinese there in such a
case not only made no effort to punish the criminal,
but would use all possible efforts to shield the murderers.
If the murder of Chung Ong was the result of
a sentence of death imposed for disobedience of some
of those laws that he had bound himself to obey, then
there was little or no chance for the discovery of the
murderer. The fact that Chung Ong had discarded
his Chinese name and taken a Cuban one, as well as
<pb n="277"/>
dispensing with the queue and costume, lent probability
to the theory. All investigators agreed that the work
was that of a Chinaman, and the cold-blooded ferocity
indicated by the mutilation of the dead body was
thoroughly in keeping with all the previous Chinese
murders which the police had had to deal with.</p>

<p>For a fortnight or so the papers contained nothing
about the murder. People were, of course, shocked
at the horror, but the assassination of an obscure
Chinaman, no matter how mysterious and terrible
the circumstances, was a different matter from the
doing to death of a respectable New York citizen,
and public interest soon languished. It was renewed,
however, when the <title>New York Herald</title> announced on
November 21st that a witness of the murder had been
discovered who not only saw the murder but could
describe the murderer. This witness was an errand
boy in the employ of a nickel plater in business in
Worcester Street. Why the boy had not spoken
before was easily understood--he was too frightened.
He now told the police that he had been sent on a message
in the afternoon of November 2nd, and on coming
back he saw two men quarrelling on the top steps
leading to Soloa's restaurant.</p>

<p><q>One was a short, thin man who looked like a
Chinaman. The other was a tall, strong Mulatto.
They were very angry with each other and their loud
voices made me stop. I thought there was going
to be a fight so I watched. I saw the tall man suddenly
draw a knife and plunge it into the little man's heart.
He had hard work to draw it out. When he did pull
the knife out the big man ran down the stairs out of
my sight. The little man followed him but he seemed
<pb n="278"/>
to fall down, for I heard a crash as he disappeared.
I was so frightened that I ran to the office and did not
tell my master until long after.</q></p>

<p>The boy was asked if he could recognise the tall
man if he saw him, and he said he could because of a
terrible scar in the fellow's left cheek.</p>

<p>The police decided that the murderer was a cigar
worker, and for two weeks the detectives went with
the boy from one Cuban cigar shop to another, but
without result. Quite by accident it was discovered
that there existed in New York an organisation of
Cuban insurrectionists, the members of which were
nearly all cigar makers. The meetings and doings
were kept secret, but in a moment of vanity the
members of the club were photographed in a group.
One of these photographs fell into the hands of the
detectives and it was shown to the boy. The latter
looked at it and pointing to one man, exclaimed,
<q>There he is! That's the man I saw stab Soloa.</q></p>

<p>Upon this the detectives showed the picture to
hundreds of Cubans, but they shook their heads.
But at last one man was found who, in reply to the
oft-repeated question, said, <q>Yes, his name was
Rebell.</q> Soon after Rebell was arrested in a cigar
factory.</p>

<p>The police had no doubt they had the right man,
for on Rebell's left cheek was the scar the boy had seen.
Rebell, however, denied most strenuously that he
had killed Soloa. He knew the Chinaman, he admitted,
but he never went to his place. He also asserted
that on the day of the murder he was at work at a
cigar factory in Brooklyn. Enquiry corroborated
this statement in a way. Rebell had made a hundred
<pb n="279"/>
cigars on the day in question, but the number to be
made in a day was two hundred. No one could be
found who could say how long Rebell was at work
or at what hour he left off.</p>

<p>Rebell was taken into custody and when before the
magistrate he broke into a fit of sobbing and protested
his innocence. He also declared that the man in the
photograph was not he. From time to time the
trial was continued but nothing came of it. No
witness could be found to say anything against him.
On the other hand, a score or more of his fellow
workmen made affidavits that he did not leave the
shop on the day in question. It was said that there
were men who would have come forward to help the
prosecution but they were afraid. They were threatened
with death if they opened their mouths. The
prisoner, who, it was said, had previously made two
attempts on the life of Soloa, was consequently
acquitted.</p>

<p>Here the story abruptly ends. No theory based
on the facts can be advanced with any degree of
probability. All that can be said is that in the hands
of a writer of powerful imagination a weird plot of
Eastern subtlety, craft, and blood-thirsty instincts
could be evolved from the facts such as they are,
and to these the murder of Chung Ong, alias Antonio
Soloa, must be left.</p>

<p>A curious phase of the mystery of murder is
that poisoners who need not be in a hurry, who
can destroy every particle of the poison employed
other than the fatal dose, who can arrange time and
even circumstances to suit their designs, constantly
defeat their own ends by excess of elaboration and in
the long run are brought to justice. In bygone
times when arsenic was in high favour and could be
easily procured, many poisoners went scot free. The
symptoms of arsenical poisoning are analogous to
those of gastritis and dysentery; toxicology was a
little-known science, death certificates were not
necessary and doctors could be easily deceived. The
arsenic poisoners of later days are faced with great
difficulties, and the insuperable one is that the body
of the victim itself supplies the cause of death. Arsenic
cannot be eliminated from the tissues by death and
indeed tends to preserve the body. Hence the skilled
poisoner discards arsenic and finds in the alkaloid
<pb n="282"/>
products much more subtle and suitable instruments
for his purpose.</p>

<p>Palmer employed strychnine. There was no known
post-mortem characteristic. The symptoms of strychnine
poisoning can only be recognised by certain
effects on the victim while living. After death the
alkaloid is difficult to isolate. As the symptoms
produced by strychnine are akin to those by tetanus,
a doctor attending a person suffering from strychnine
poisoning might well mistake one for the other. It
was on this point that Palmer's defence rested. Save
for the surrounding circumstances his defence might
have succeeded. But though Palmer was aware of
the subtle properties of strychnine, he was not certain
that it could not be detected in the body after death
or he would not have attempted to upset the jars
containing the viscera to be analysed. Failing to
do so he tried to bribe the postboy who had to convey
the jars to London to overturn them. The postboy
refused and his evidence told terribly against the
accused. As it happened, Palmer's anxiety was
unfounded. No strychnine was discovered in Cook's
body, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sergeant Shee, who defended Palmer,
made a powerful use of the fact. But all to no purpose.
It was <soCalled>the jockeying</soCalled> (the term Palmer applied
to the summing-up of Lord Chief Justice Cockburn)
that did it. Palmer protested to the last that Cook
did not die from strychnine, but if it were so and death
resulted from the antimony which was given previous
to the strychnine Palmer was guilty all the same.
There is every reason to believe that he poisoned
others besides Cook. He took the pitcher to the
well once too often.</p>

<pb n="283"/>
<p>Thomas Wainewright, the <q>Janus Weathercock</q>
of the <title>London Magazine</title> and an associate of Charles
Lamb and his circle, was also a wholesale poisoner.
Like Palmer he employed strychnine, but unlike him
he escaped the gallows. Medical knowledge of the
alkaloid poisons in the thirties was limited, and thanks
to this ignorance Wainewright evaded the punishment
due to him. He is said to be the original of Julius
Slinkton in Charles Dickens's <title>Hunted Down</title>. Wainewright
was transported to Tasmania for forgery;
his luck in escaping the capital charge was amazing.
He made blunders over and over again but no notice
was taken of them. In these scientific days he would
assuredly have been hanged.</p>

<p>Neill Cream as a devotee of strychnine is outside
the pale of ordinary murderers. He used death as
his means of livelihood. In some cases his fiendish
craft may have been successful, but the three instances
which came to light during his trial were utter failures
and led to his undoing. Like Jack the Ripper, he
selected his victims from women who got their living
on the streets and for whose fate nobody cared. Four
women--there may have been more--died from the
<soCalled>long pills</soCalled> which Cream induced them to take.
In the first case the doctor who attended was careless
and indifferent, and though he saw the woman alive
and should have recognised the symptoms he certified
that she had died from excessive drinking. The other
three victims were taken to the hospital and here no
mistake was made.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cream was seeking to make money out
of murders, and a more callous method was never
devised. In its recklessness it almost touched
<pb n="284"/>
absurdity. Soon after the death of the first woman--Matilda
Clover by name--a well-known West End
physician received a letter, the writer of which insinuated
that the physician had given poison to Clover,
that he (the writer) was in possession of incriminating
evidence and he would require to be paid heavily to
keep his mouth shut. The recipient of the letter
handed it over to the police, but the latter did not
trouble to enquire into the death of Matilda Clover,
though her name and address were given, and Cream
continued his trade as a dealer in death.</p>

<p>He disappeared for a time, having gone to Canada,
and on his return to England recommenced his cold-blooded,
stupid course of wholesale murdering. In
the house where he had rooms also lodged a young
medical student, and soon after the inquests on Alice
Marsh and Emma Shrivall (who died of strychnine
poisoning in <abbr>St.</abbr> Thomas's Hospital) the father of the
student--a doctor at Barnstaple--received a letter
accusing his son of poisoning girls, the writer demanding
£1,500 as the price of his silence. The father
refused to be blackmailed and handed the letter to
the police, who saw it was now time to take action.
But for the moment they were quite in the dark.</p>

<p>Then came the inquest on Ellen Donworth, who it
was proved died from strychnine, and while the
enquiry was proceeding the coroner received a letter
signed <q>A. O'Brien,</q> who offered to bring the murderer
to justice provided he were paid £30,000 by the
Government. A fortnight went over and a well-known
member of Parliament received a blackmailing letter
signed <q>H. Bayne.</q> A comparison between the
three letters showed that the writing in each was the
<pb n="285"/>
same, and pursuing the clue furnished by the letter
to the Barnstaple doctor the police came to the conclusion
that <q><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Neill,</q> the student's fellow lodger,
would be worth shadowing. Meanwhile, the body
of Matilda Clover, the first victim, was exhumed without
the knowledge of anybody outside Scotland Yard.
This was in November, but though the net was slowly
closing round Cream he was let alone.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, he began to suspect something
disquieting was going on and he took counsel of a
private enquiry agent named Haynes. Why he should
have taken this course rather than lie low and have
seized the first opportunity to vanish is only one of
the many inconceivable ineptitudes which marked
almost every step of this egregious blunderer. One
day while travelling in an omnibus with Haynes he
heard a newsboy shouting <q>Arrest in the Stamford
Street Case.</q> This, Cream appears to have thought,
referred to Alice Marsh and Emma Shrivall, who lived
in this--at that time--thoroughfare of doubtful reputation.
On alighting he bought the evening papers
and eagerly scanned them. Haynes noticed that
when he had finished reading he became relieved.
No wonder, for the arrest had nothing to do with the
poisonings, but belonged to another affair also in
Stamford Street.</p>

<p>The miscreant probably prided himself on his
masterly cunning when he scraped acquaintance with
McIntyre, an officer attached to the Criminal Investigation
Department. Perhaps he wanted to convey
the impression that he was quite ready to court
enquiry. McIntyre, who at first did not suspect
Cream, very soon became greatly interested in his
<pb n="286"/>
new friend, and it was not long before he neatly
trapped him.</p>

<p>The two were having a cheerful glass together at
a Lambeth hostelry, and Cream was complaining
about the ridiculous action of Scotland Yard in subjecting
him to surveillance. He asked McIntyre
what he ought to do.</p>

<p><q>You'd better see Inspector Harvey or Chief
Inspector Maloney about it. Just write what you
want and I'll pass it on.</q></p>

<p>Cream accordingly wrote his complaint on a piece
of paper he took from his pocket, and the two set out
for Scotland Yard, but as they were crossing Westminster
Bridge he suddenly became suspicious, refused
to proceed any further and left McIntyre to go on by
himself. McIntyre was quite content. He had got
what he wanted and more than he could have hoped
for. Cream's handwriting was compared with that of
the blackmailing letters and found to be identical,
while the paper he had used had the same watermark
as that of the letter sent to the Barnstaple doctor!
Little more was required to convict this clumsy,
wholesale poisoner.</p>

<p>Quite as imbecilic and reckless was Christiana
Edmunds, who to satisfy her morbid spite against one
particular person broadcasted strychnine without
scruple. From first to last she incriminated herself,
yet had she not been so scrupulously careful in her
preparations to meet possible enquiries she might
have gone her way and no one would have been the
wiser.</p>

<p>The strange drama opened in a confectioner's shop
in Brighton. For some days the assistants had been
<pb n="287"/>
puzzled by purchases of chocolate creams by boys,
who after a little lapse of time brought them back
to be exchanged for others saying that those first
bought were not the kind required. The thing was
repeated so often that twice the assistants sent one
of the staff after the boys to watch what they did
with the chocolates. The report on each occasion
was that the boy was met by a lady to whom he gave
the chocolates, and no more was thought of the matter.
Shortly after, a little boy who ate a chocolate cream
from a box purchased at the same shop was taken ill
and died in a few hours. He had been poisoned by
strychnine. An inquest was held; other chocolate
creams in the shop were analysed and found to contain
strychnine; the confectioner gave evidence and was
exonerated from blame.</p>

<p>Before the death of the child a lady called upon
the confectioner and accused him of selling poisoned
chocolates, and while the inquest was being held she
presented herself as a witness but her evidence was
not accepted. Then she put in a statement how she
had bought chocolates of the same confectioner which
had made her and some of her friends ill. Nothing
came of this statement; the enquiry was closed and the
affair was almost forgotten, when a sensation was
caused by the arrest of the lady who was so zealous
in accusing the confectioner.</p>

<p>The police had in their possession a strange story
which they proceeded to unfold. It appeared that
a lady, who had been a customer of a Brighton chemist
for some four years, purchased a small quantity of
strychnine, signing in his poison register book the
name of Wood, Hillside, Kingston. Shortly after
<pb n="288"/>
this a boy brought an order from another Brighton
chemist for a quarter of an ounce of strychnine, but
the first chemist thinking the order too big supplied
only a drachm. The inquest on the poisoned child
followed, the chemist receiving a letter purporting
to be from the coroner asking for the production of
his poison register for the purpose of an enquiry into
a matter which had nothing to do with anything
sold by him. The book was delivered to the messenger,
subsequently returned, and the chemist noticed that
a leaf <emph>preceding</emph> that containing the entry of the
sale of strychnine to <q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Wood</q> had been torn out.
A curious discovery followed--both the order for a
quarter of an ounce of strychnine from another chemist
and the letter from the coroner were forgeries! As
in the case of Neill Cream, it was of vital importance
to compare handwritings. The police wrote a letter
about nothing in particular to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Edmunds and
she replied. Her writing gave her away as the forger.
It is to be presumed that in removing the leaf from
the register she tore out the wrong one, thus adding
blunder to blunder.</p>

<p>Then search was made for small boys and three
were found. They all told the same tale. They
had each been stopped by a lady who sent them for
chocolate creams. The creams were not what she
wanted and they took them back. In the meantime
the lady had contrived to insinuate strychnine into
some of the creams first purchased.</p>

<p>What was at the back of this diabolical schemer's
mind? Just this. She had taken a morbid fancy
to a doctor who had attended her. The doctor was
married and it occurred to Christiana Edmunds that
<pb n="289"/>
if she got rid of the doctor's wife it would further her
design. Accordingly she gave her rival a chocolate
cream which the lady found so bitter she spat it out.
The doctor thereupon roundly accused Christiana of
having attempted to poison his wife, and the poisoner,
to clear herself and throw the blame on the confectioner,
<q>pursued,</q> as Sergeant Ballantyne, who prosecuted,
put it, <q>a course of conduct so extraordinary as to
be totally unparalleled in the records of any criminal
court of justice.</q> It may also be said that her blunders
were equally unparalleled. She was condemned to
death, but declared afterwards to be insane. Her
insanity is her only excuse.</p>

<p>Pritchard, Lamson and Smethurst belong to the
type of poisoners headed by Thomas Wainewright.
They were masters of hypocrisy and concealed their
moral depravity beneath a mask of affability and
conciliation. Palmer, on the other hand, affected a
bluff jollity which perhaps was even more deceptive.
The blunders of these men were due to over-confidence
in their immunity from detection due to their profession.
Pritchard made one fatal error through impatience.
His wife's mother he poisoned with antimony
followed by aconitine, and her death took place with
startling suddenness, but poison was not suspected.
Within three weeks <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pritchard, who had been
ailing for some time, died and without apparent cause.
In each case Pritchard himself filled up the death certificates,
the doctor who had been called in refusing to do
so. Before the funeral could be completed Pritchard was
arrested and the post-mortem showed that the deaths
of both mother and daughter were from the same cause,
poisoning with antimony in combination with aconitine.</p>
<pb n="290"/>
<p>There was no evidence that Pritchard had administered
poison, but he omitted to destroy a bottle of
Batley's solution--a preparation of opium from which
mother and daughter found relief and constantly
took--and in this bottle both antimony and aconitine
were found. Moreover, it was proved that Pritchard
had bought large quantities of both poisons.
His haste to get rid of his mother-in-law was
because at her death his wife would come into
some £2,000 and Pritchard was in great monetary
difficulties.</p>

<p>Lamson followed on the same lines. He also
wanted money and he also used aconitine. His over-elaboration
in the poisoning of his schoolboy brother-in-law
defeated itself. Yet he was so supremely
self-assured of his own safety that when a paragraph
relative to the inquest on young Percy John appeared
in the newspapers he had the assurance to present
himself at Bow Street police station, announcing
himself as <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Lamson, and stating that he had came
straight from Paris to know what he was <q>to do about
it.</q> He was received very civilly but found himself
a prisoner, and his guilt was proved in spite of his
using a subtle poison which he thought would never
be detected.</p>

<p>How in the Armstrong case the hand of the poisoner
was revealed all will remember. And so with Seddon.
This man was so convinced his craft would never
betray him that he did not take precautions to cover
up his deadly steps. The purchase of arsenical fly
papers, considering how they had figured in the
Maybrick affair and in that of Catherine Flanagan and
Margaret Higgins, the wholesale poisoners of Liverpool,
<pb n="291"/>
was a stupid blunder which brought Seddon's neck
within the hangman's noose.</p>

<p>Criminal records, so far as one has been able to
discover, show only two instances beside a recent one,
which it is not necessary to go into, where crafty and
carefully arranged poisonings have not been satisfactorily
traced to their authors. One of these is
the case of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Smethurst, and the other that of Thomas
Winslow of Liverpool.</p>

<p>There was not the least doubt that Miss Isabella
Banks, in whose death Smethurst was pecuniarily
interested, was poisoned. Before she died Smethurst
was charged with having administered poison to her,
but there was not sufficient evidence to justify a
committal and he was released. After her death he
was re-arrested and charged with murder. The body
showed unmistakable signs of antimonial poisoning,
and Smethurst was found guilty, but afterwards
reprieved, escaping through a loophole made by the
blundering of Professor Taylor, the analyst.</p>

<p>The case of Winslow stands by itself. His trial
for <q>administering antimony to Ann James</q> with
intention to cause her death is, for two reasons, unique
in the annals of poison mysteries. One reason is that
the woman's death was due to cancer and not to the
antimony which was found in her body and was
undoubtedly given her by some person, and the other
that the circumstantial evidence against Winslow
was of such a nature that at first sight it would seem
difficult to disconnect him from her death in a criminal
sense. The story is a very curious and complicated
one, but too long to detail here. Direct evidence
against Winslow was wanting and he was acquitted.</p>

</argument>

<p>It may be argued, from the many unsolved murder
mysteries which have baffled all attempts at solution,
that the disappearance of the murderer without
leaving a clue behind as to his identity is a comparatively
easy matter provided no motive for the crime
can be discovered. Motiveless murders, it is true,
are the most difficult to fathom, but there are cases
where, through some oversight, the guilty hand has
been disclosed. Perhaps long deliberation over a
contemplated crime deadens the senses and, though
every step has apparently been thought out and possible
detection guarded against, something unforeseen,
either during the perpetration of the deed or afterwards,
has upset all calculations and has found the murderer
at his wits' end how to meet the emergency. It is
consequently not surprising to find that he either
blunders, or is so confident his guilt cannot be brought
home to him, that he blindly does the very thing which
<pb n="294"/>
convicts him. The murder of O'Connor by the
Mannings is an example of the first, and that of
Harriet Lane by Henry Wainwright an instance of
the second.</p>

<p>The Mannings arranged everything to their satisfaction.
They enticed O'Connor to their house without
a soul knowing that he was going there. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Manning
shot him, the grave in the stone-paved kitchen and the
quicklime were in readiness. The body was buried
and the flagstone replaced and cemented. They
sold their furniture, shut up the house and disappeared,
the woman to Edinburgh, the man to Jersey. Five
days went over before the police visited the house.
They might not have lighted upon the body for some
time but--fatal oversight!--every room was dirty
and disordered save the kitchen, and that was spick
and span, and the reset flagstone impossible to be
overlooked. The body was unrecognisable, the quicklime
had done its work well, but--another blunder--the
gold setting of a false tooth remained. Identity
was established.</p>

<p>Henry Wainwright, with the assistance of his brother
Thomas, was diabolically cunning in the doing to death
of his victim and in the concealment of her body.
In spite of the hue and cry after the missing woman,
her corpse was safely hidden for a whole year beneath
the floor of Wainwright's warehouse in the Whitechapel
road. The house was sold and the body had
to be removed. This was done by dismemberment,
and it is more than likely Wainwright would have
succeeded in getting the parcel away without exciting
suspicion but he was foolish enough to obtain the assistance
of a youth and--inconceivable act of stupidity--left
<pb n="295"/>
the lad in charge of the packages while he himself
went for a cab! He might easily have done
the reverse, but a kink in his brain sent him to his
doom. In spite of his craft he was an ignorant blunderer,
for instead of using quicklime, which would
have destroyed all traces of bodily resemblance, he
employed chloride of lime, which acted as a preservative!</p>

<p>Mistakes are not confined to the perpetrators of
premeditated murders. It was pure chance which
led Franz Muller to travel alone with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Briggs in
a railway carriage, though no doubt he had robbery
and possibly murder in his mind when he started on
the journey. It was chance also which caused him
in his hurry to go off with his victim's hat and leave
his own behind. The blunder as it stood was bad
enough, but he made it worse when he cut it down
an inch and a half and sewed the brim on to the
reduced crown. The hatter who had made hats for
thirty years for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Briggs identified the hat Muller
had been wearing when arrested, cut down though
it was, as his manufacture, and furthermore said that the
brim was not fastened as by a hatter, but had been
sewn on by one accustomed to use a needle. And
Muller was a tailor!</p>

<p>This was not Muller's only error. He exchanged
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Briggs's watch and chain for another, and the
jeweller placed the latter in a cardboard box bearing
his name and address. This box Muller gave to the
little daughter of a cabman in whose house he lodged.
He disappeared, and shortly after the cabman saw a
description of the hat left in the railway carriage and
recognised it by the striped lining as one he had bought
<pb n="296"/>
for his mild-speaking, soft-voiced German lodger.
Nemesis, indeed, pursued Muller from the first. There
was not an atom of doubt as to the justice of the
verdict, yet people were to be found who believed in
his innocence, and among them was <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Carlyle, who,
shrewd and exceptionally intelligent as she was,
seems to have been adamantine where her foibles
were concerned.</p>

<p>The loopholes for escape given to some criminals
and denied to others are not the least curious of
unsolved murder mysteries. Fate dogged Muller to
the end and turned all his mistakes against him.
Lefroy, Muller's fellow in railway assassination, had,
on the contrary, all his blunders overlooked, and had
not his penniless condition at the last compelled him
to throw up the sponge he might have gone scot free.
But he had a mentality and temperament totally
different from the German's. Muller was dull-witted,
Lefroy imaginative and fertile in expedients. Muller
succeeded in escaping while the murder of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Briggs
was undiscovered, and some days elapsed before the
identity of his assailant was established. What followed
the deed itself did not trouble the murderer.
But Lefroy had to be alive to every emergency, no
matter how unexpected, and it is only due to his
ingenuity to say that he was equal to the occasion.
Fortune, however, was kind to him.</p>

<p>He was favoured from the first by chance--for, in
default of a better name, so it must be called. But
for the accident of a railway official being near on the
London Bridge platform while he was fumbling at
the stiff handle of the carriage door he might have
gone to another compartment and, circumstances not
<pb n="297"/>
being favourable, his murderous intent might have
been abandoned. But the official came to his rescue,
turned the handle, and he found himself with only
one fellow traveller, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gold.</p>

<p>Gold was attacked as the train was passing through
Horley. A woman saw a struggle going on in one
of the carriages but she put it down to a couple of
Brighton trippers larking. A passenger in the train
heard the sound of pistol shots, but it did not suggest
anything to him and he took no notice. Seven miles
further on was Balcombe tunnel and here <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gold's
body was thrust on to the line. Lefroy imagined the
train was express to Brighton, where he would be able
to escape among the crowd before the bloodstained
interior of the carriage was noticed. He did not know
that it was the rule for express trains to stop at Preston
Park to collect tickets, and when he found the train
slowing down he had to invent a story at a moment's
notice.</p>

<p>It is about a twenty minutes' run from Balcombe
to Preston Park. Lefroy, of slight physique if wiry,
had gone through a life and death struggle, he had
dragged a heavy man to the carriage door and had
flung him out. In such a reaction of mind and body
as must have followed, time was annihilated. Yet
on finding himself face to face with discovery he
contrived to formulate a plan. White-cheeked and
dishevelled, with a cut or two on his face, he presented
himself at the window and called to the ticket collector
that he had been murderously attacked. The collector
thought he was a lunatic, for the train being an express,
how could the fellows get away? The young man
could only say he became insensible and did not
<pb n="298"/>
know what had happened. Then the collector caught
sight of a strange thing--an inch or two of gold chain
was dangling from the man's boot. The collector
tugged at the chain and found there was a watch at
the end of it. The singular circumstance made the
collector think that the passenger was a lunatic and
had tried to commit suicide, although there was far
more blood on the carriage than the madman's slight
cuts warranted.</p>

<p>The collector went on with Lefroy to Brighton,
and from the station to the Sussex Hospital. The
surgeon could only find a bruise on the temple and
a few trifling cuts semi-circular in shape. He suggested
a night in the hospital, but this Lefroy would not hear
of. The police and the railway officials were most
obliging. He was put in a cab and taken back to the
station, the constable in charge buying him a collar
(14&#xbd; inches, just a boy's size!) and scarf. The ticket
collector considerately held his tongue and said not
a word about the gold chain hanging from the boot,
nor that he had found two flash sovereigns in the
carriage, remaining silent even when the chief constable
discovered bogus coins of the same description
in the injured man's pocket.</p>

<p>Lefroy lodged at Wallington, and a couple of con-
stables were detached to see him safely home. By
the time the train reached Three Bridges on the return
journey the news had arrived that the body of a man
had been found in Balcombe tunnel and the station
master whispered to the constable not to let Lefroy
out of his sight. But the constables were superior
to advice. They left their charge in the care of his
landlord and went away. When they came again after
<pb n="299"/>
further information the bird had flown. Days went
over before Lefroy was run to earth in an obscure
lodging in Stepney, but it was not due to any astute-
ness on the part of the police. Lefroy had the luck
to lodge with a woman who rarely bothered about
reading newspapers. She knew nothing about Lefroy
and the murder, and when she went to the police it
was to ask what she was to do as she could get no
money out of her lodger, who never went out to work.
Then the game was up.</p>

<p>Neill Cream and Christiana Edmunds, as we have
seen, convicted themselves when they put pen to
paper, and to the list of such blunderers must be
added the name of Thomas Henry Hocker. Hocker
was a friend of a music teacher named Delarue, and
laid a scheme to rob and murder the latter. This
scheme might have been conceived by a writer of
murder detective fiction. One February evening a
baker delivering bread in Belsize Lane, at that time
a lonely spot but now covered with houses and known
as Belsize Park, heard repeated cries of <q>Murder!</q>
He told a couple of policemen, who searched the border
of Hampstead Heath and found a man with a terrible
wound in his throat lying near the wall of Belsize
House. The policeman went for a stretcher and
the other remained on watch by the body, and while
so doing there came up to him a young man in a
jovial mood, having, in fact, been singing as he walked.
He asked the policeman what was the matter, and the
constable telling him that he thought the man had
cut his throat, the stranger bent down and felt the
man's pulse.</p>

<p>The constable arrived with the stretcher and was
<pb n="300"/>
accompanied by a tradesman named Satterthwaite
of Heath Street. Satterthwaite was more curious
about the jovial young man than were the constables
and asked him a good many questions. They parted
in Belsize Lane, where the young fellow lighted a cigar
at the policeman's lantern and went on his way.</p>

<p>The dead man was identified as James Delarue, who
sometimes was known as Cooper. It was shown
that when Delarue left his lodgings on the evening
of the murder he was wearing a watch, but no watch
was found upon him, nor was there any money.
Apparently the motive was robbery. In one of
Delarue's pockets was, however, a letter signed
<q>Caroline,</q> upbraiding him for his faithlessness.
It was dated the previous day and the writer implored
him to meet her at the place where he had always
made her happy. The letter was written in blue
ink and the envelope secured by a wafer marked
with the letter F. The envelope was addressed, <q>By
Miss F. James Cooper, Esq., Hampstead Road.</q>
The inference was that Delarue had been stabbed as
an act of vengeance.</p>

<p>No clue could be found to <q>Miss F.</q> and as the
days went on suspicion was attached to Thomas
Hocker, who turned out to be the jovial young man
who made himself so conspicuous on the night of the
murder.</p>

<p>How it came about that Hocker was arrested need
not here be detailed. There were many fragments
of circumstantial evidence against him, but they
might not have proved conclusive but for one start-
ling discovery. In his room were found a bottle of
blue ink, paper corresponding to that on which
<pb n="301"/>
<q>Caroline</q> had written her despairing appeal, and
wafers marked with the letter F. This left him
without any hope of escape and he underwent the
penalty he deserved. It may be asked why he went
back to the scene of his crime and so risked identifi-
cation. The answer is obvious. He must have known
that if Delarue was not dead, the consequences
would have been very awkward for him, and he was
anxious to satisfy himself. He had not reckoned
upon Satterthwaite's curiosity.</p>

<p>John Watson Laurie, who murdered his fellow
tourist, Edwin Rose, with whom he was travelling
in Scotland, deliberately put his head in the noose
through his handwriting. Rose's body was found
under a heap of stones in a lonely spot in the neigh-
bourhood of the Goatfell mountain, and as it was
known that Laurie had been his companion, Laurie
was naturally sought for but without avail. While
the mystery was at its height, a letter purporting to
be from Laurie, posted from Liverpool, but giving
no address, appeared in the <title>Glasgow Mail</title> stating
that though the writer had been with Rose, he had
left him on the mountain with two men, and that he
had had nothing to do with his death. This letter was
looked upon as a hoax. A fortnight later another
letter to much the same effect, signed <q>Laurie</q> and
posted from Aberdeen, was received by the <title>Glasgow
Herald</title>. The <title>Herald</title> had the letter photographed
and published a facsimile.</p>

<p>Despite these aids the police were helpless. The
whereabouts of Laurie could not be ascertained, and
probably the affair would have died down but for the
sharp eyes and good memory of the landlord of an
<pb n="302"/>
Aberdeen hotel. The letter in the <title>Herald</title> was dated
August 27th, and the landlord recollected that on the
day in question a young man had asked for writing
materials with which he was supplied, a fresh sheet
of paper being inserted in the blotting book at the
same time. The landlord compared the blotter with
the published letter, and on the former among other
traces of writing were the words <q>left Glasgow</q> which
were the exact counterpart of the same words in the
facsimile. The clue was sufficient. Laurie was ulti-
mately captured in Glasgow, tried in Edinburgh and
found guilty, but only by a majority of the jury--for
which reason presumably, but for no other, the
capital sentence was commuted to one of penal servi-
tude for life.</p>

<p>Belonging in its elements to detective fiction, the
story of James Mullens presents an example of the
super-bungler in a fashion difficult to parallel. In
the Grove Road, Bow, lived a miserly, avaricious old
woman named Elmsley. Not having been seen or
heard of for some days, Walter Emms, the old woman's
collector of rents, who had called several times to no
effect, gave information, and the police entered the
house. Here in a small room on the top floor they
found the old woman lying with her skull battered
in. She had been dead nearly a week.</p>

<p>The house had not been broken into, nor were there
any signs of disorder in any of the rooms. No money
was found, and as <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Elmsley had no confidence in
banks but hoarded up her wealth and was believed to
have a large sum secreted somewhere, it was assumed
that the murderer was also a thief. Skilled detectives
set to work, a reward Of £300 was offered, but very
<pb n="303"/>
little progress was made. Then unexpectedly a man
named James Mullens, who was employed by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Elmsley to do odd jobs, and who had been connected
with the police until incapacitated for duty, volun-
teered to give the police some information.</p>

<p>Mullens's <q>information</q> was that he suspected
Emms had something to do with the murder and had
kept watch upon him in consequence. That very
morning, he said, he had seen Emms come from his
cottage holding a parcel which he took into a shed
on the brickfields near which he lived, and in a short
time came out without. Mullens was quite sure
there was something in the parcel which would put
the search on the right track.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning the detectives and
Mullens met at the shed. Mullens was told to remain
outside while the interior was being examined. Noth-
ing was found, at which Mullens was much surprised,
and he volunteered to help in the search. He was
allowed to do so and he at once pointed to a stone
slab resting against the wall and asked the detectives
to look behind it. They obeyed and found a small
paper parcel tied round with a bootlace. It contained
a few articles of no value, but they did not tell <choice><corr>Mullens</corr><sic>Mullins</sic></choice>
this and he wanted to know if any money had been
found. The detective's answer was that if there
was anything in the information he had given, he
would be entitled to some advantage. Mullens ap-
peared very pleased and said that he should give the
detective some of the £300 when it was handed over.
Meanwhile one of the detectives had quietly pocketed
the bootlace--after glancing at Mullens's boots,
one of which had no lace, while that in the
<pb n="304"/>
other corresponded to the lace used to tie up the
parcel.</p>

<p>Emms and his wife strongly denied all knowledge
of the parcel, but the former was taken to the station,
as also was Mullens. Both were charged on suspicion,
greatly to the indignation of Mullens. Then the
lodgings of the latter at Chelsea were searched and
here was found property proved to belong to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Elmsley, and a stonemason's hammer which fitted
the wounds on the skull of the murdered woman.</p>

<p>Emms was released and Mullens stood his trial.
He had not a dog's chance. His attempt to fix his
guilt on an innocent man to get the reward excited
universal disgust, and the uproarious scene outside
Newgate on the morning of his execution was such
as would have frozen the heart of the most hardened
criminal.</p>

<p>James Mullens can claim the distinction of figuring
as one of the types selected by Desbarolles, the pioneer
of palmistry, to exemplify his theory of the possessors
of the <q>scaffold mark</q> and the <q>murderer's thumb.</q>
The <q>scaffold mark,</q> according to Desbarolles, fore-
shadows a violent death, and a drawing of this mark
as it appeared in Mullens's palm--a network of broken
lines between the fleshy part of the thumb and the bases
of the first and second fingers--is given in his volu-
minous treatise. The <q>Murderer's Thumb,</q> or <foreign xml:lang="fr">pouce
en bille</foreign>, has a broad spatula tip, the nail embedded
in the flesh which borders it in a very pronounced
fashion. Desbarolles gives the names of several male-
factors who owned this unenviable thumb, but it is
impossible to say whether a reliable theory can be
deduced from a few examples. Desbarolles omits
<pb n="305"/>
to mention how he came to see the hand of James
Mullens, and in the absence of satisfactory evidence
considerable doubt must rest on the philosopher's
statement.</p>

<p>It is quite clear, when identity of the victim would
be fatal evidence against the murderer, that the
only course open to the latter is to get rid of the body.
Four ways have been adopted--dismemberment and
distribution of the fragments, burning, concealment
in a trunk or chest and burying beneath the earth.</p>

<p>The cases of dismemberment are not so numerous
in England as on the Continent, although, according
to one student of criminology, the method was first
brought into prominence by Greenacre. He cut up
the body and distributed it, the first discovery being
made in some osier beds which then existed in the
neighbourhood of the Camberwell New Road. The
head which, wrapped in a coloured handkerchief, he is
said to have carried resting on his knees in an omnibus,
he threw into the Surrey Canal, a great mistake, as
<pb n="308"/>
its passage was impeded by a lock-gate and so was
brought to light.</p>

<p>The case of dismemberment which excited the most
interest in London was that known as the <q>Carpet
Bag Mystery</q> in 1857. The story is simple enough.
Two lads rowing on the Thames saw a carpet bag on
one of the abutments of Waterloo Bridge. The bag
was found to contain mutilated fragments of a human
body, and garments bloodstained and cut with what
looked like dagger thrusts. A dozen theories were
put forward as possible explanations, but the mystery
was never revealed. Years after, Sir Robert Ander-
son, Assistant Commissioner of Metropolitan Police,
writing in <title>Blackwood's Magazine</title>, put forward a solution
of the problem, to the effect that the body was that
of an Italian police spy whose mission in this country
being discovered, the men who were implicated in his
instructions murdered him. Sir Robert did not speak
from his own knowledge, but from what was told him
by an agent of the French Secret Service. The thing
reads like a fairy tale and cannot be accepted.</p>

<p>Still more preposterous is a statement by a writer
in an evening paper who, in commenting on Sir
Robert Anderson's story, said that he had been told
by a veteran journalist that the <q>mystery</q> was a
concoction of Butterfield, a well-known penny-a-liner,
who prepared the contents of the bag and placed the
latter on the bridge simply for making money out of
paragraphs relating to the gruesome find. Butter-
field, whom the writer of these records knew personally,
was the most audacious and enterprising penny-a-
liner of his day, but truth was not familiar to him.
Moreover, he was an impudent boaster of his exploits.
<pb n="309"/>
His word was not to be taken seriously on any
subject.</p>

<p>Another case of dismemberment was that of portions
of a human body found in the River Thames off Batter-
sea. Murder was assumed to be at the bottom of
the mystery, but more than this cannot be said.</p>

<p>Dismemberment is obviously the precursor of des-
truction by fire. The atrocity in this direction of
Theodore Gardelle in 1761 is too revolting to be
recalled further than the bare facts. He murdered
a woman named King in a house near Leicester Square.
He was by himself at his hideous work for two or three
days, but he found, as his imitators have found, that
the entire incineration of a human body is one of the
most formidable tasks that can be attempted. Burn as
fiercely and as long as one may, some perverse power
delights in preserving relics to bear witness to the
nature of the holocaust.</p>

<p>Cook, a bookbinder of Leicester, was perhaps
better equipped than Gardelle for the same frightful
purpose. He murdered and robbed a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pass to
whom he owed money. The deed was committed
in Cook's workshop built over a cowhouse, and the
murderer set to work to burn the body. He started
doing so in the afternoon and kept up a huge fire
until eight o'clock when he went out, had a game of
skittles, and returned at half-past ten. The fire
blazed through the night, and at half-past four the
next morning he went out with the owner of the
cowhouse and helped milk the cows. He was in his
workshop the whole of the next day, and at night the
fire was burning more fiercely than ever. The blinds
were drawn and it struck some of the observers, who
<pb n="310"/>
were attracted by the bright light, as curious that no
shadows should be thrown on the strongly illuminated
blind. Was Cook at work inside? was the natural
question of a man named Timson. At that moment
a neighbour came along who said that he had just
met Cook going to his house. <q>Then,</q> cried Timson,
<q>the place must be on fire!</q> Timson broke open
the door and the horrible mystery was revealed.
The head was missing, and the doctors thought it
could not have been burnt but had been otherwise
disposed of. Cook, however, maintained the contrary.</p>

<p>Kate Webster, who murdered her mistress, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Thomas, at Richmond, attempted to combine three
methods. After dismembering the body she started
to boil and burn portions in the copper. She probably
found this process too long and too risky, and putting
the head in a leather bag weighted, she dropped the
bag in the Thames. She deposited a foot at Twicken-
ham and placed the rest of the remains in a box which
she corded, and after getting a boy to help her she
carried the box to Richmond Bridge, over which she
let it fall. The bag was never found, but the box
was and led to her being hanged.</p>

<p>Nothing could demonstrate the insuperable difficulty
of destroying a body by burning than the attempt
of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Webster to get rid of the corpse of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Parkman
in this fashion. Webster was the professor of chem-
istry at the Medical College, Boston, and Parkman
one of the professors at Harvard College, the site of
which had been his gift. Parkman was an eccentric
man and his figure was as eccentric as his ways. His
lower jaw projected beyond his upper one and his
teeth were false with gold settings. This peculiarity
<pb n="311"/>
played an important part in the sequel to the tragedy.
Strictly fair and honourable in all his dealings, he
could not forgive any laxity in the fulfilment of
obligations towards himself by others. Webster, im-
pulsive and extravagant, had borrowed money from
Parkman which he failed to repay, and relations
between the two were strained in consequence.</p>

<p>On Friday, November 23rd, 1840, Parkman did not
come home to lunch. The family were at first puzzled
and then alarmed, the Professor being extremely
regular in his habits. For two days search for him
never ceased, and on Monday a reward was offered.
Meanwhile <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Webster called on Sunday on <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Parkman's brother and told the latter that the doctor
had visited him on Friday afternoon at the Medical
College. He added that on that occasion he had
paid <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Parkman £90 that he owed him. This was
a piece of gratuitous information which led the police
to call on Webster at his rooms at the Medical College
and make a search. They had no suspicion that <abbr>Dr.</abbr>
Webster was in any way implicated, and the visit
was simply one of duty. The search was purely
superficial and nothing was found. This was on,
Tuesday, November 27th.</p>

<p>Soon after <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Parkman's disappearance the move-
ments of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Webster began to excite the curiosity
of the janitor of the Medical College. Webster was
shut up all day in his rooms. When he left, the door
of the laboratory was always locked, a most unusual
thing. Finally, the janitor noticed that the wall of
the lower laboratory was hot, indicating that the stove
was being kept continually alight. At last the man
could contain his curiosity no longer and, descending
<pb n="312"/>
into the drain in the basement, he commenced boring
a hole in the wall of the vault in which the lower
laboratory was situated. When this was effected he
looked through, and by the aid of a light he saw
portions of a human body.</p>

<p>The secret was out. Besides the evidence in the
vault, fragments of human bones were found in the
lower laboratory stove, and others in a box filled with
tan. Webster was arrested and duly took his trial,
which lasted eleven days. Strong as the presumptive
evidence was, it would have failed to prove that the
remains were those of the missing man but for one
thing--the false teeth. Not only was melted gold
found in the ashes, but also a portion of the jaw with
its peculiar formation. So peculiar was it, that the
mould which the dentist made fitted the fragment of
the jaw found, and the dentist unhesitatingly declared
that this jaw was <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Parkman's and no other man's.</p>

<p>After this there could be but one end. Webster
was found guilty and sentenced to death. Then
Webster made a long confession asserting that Parkman
had irritated him beyond endurance, and that in a
moment of passion he struck him with a heavy stick.
Parkman fell senseless, and to his horror his assailant
found he had killed him. He had never intended
to commit murder, and in his agitation of mind, not
knowing what to do, he resolved to conceal his crime.
A curious drawing of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Parkman's skeleton, recon-
structed from the fragments of bone discovered, is
given by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Quain in his <title>Principles of Forensic
Medicine</title>.</p>

<p>We now come to the box method. Here indeed is
a long list of conspicuous failures from the murderer's
<pb n="313"/>
point of view. At first sight the hiding of a body in
a box would seem to be an easy and ready mode of
disposal, but in practice it has proved of no avail,
whether on the Continent, in the United States, or in
England. In Paris, in the year 1832, a bank porter
named Ramus was poisoned by his friend, Regey.
The head was placed in a box and thrown in the
Seine, to be fished up almost immediately afterwards
by a party of boatmen.</p>

<p>In 1850, a well-known dealer in art bronzes, named
Poirier Desfontaines, an old bachelor, was murdered
by his servant, one Vion. <choice><corr>Desfontaines'</corr><orig>Desfontaine's</orig></choice> assassin
sent the evidence of his crime in a trunk to Châteauroux,
<q>to be left till called for.</q> There was no trace of
Vion to be found, and he was only captured by an
ingenious use of the public journals, devised by the
celebrated detective, Canler. Canler had a paragraph
inserted to the effect that all search for the criminal
would be useless, seeing that he had managed to escape
into Spain. Believing that the police had abandoned
pursuit, Vion imprudently showed himself in Paris,
and was apprehended.</p>

<p>A few years later, Victor Domby imitated Vion's
exploit, for he also despatched his victim in a trunk,
<q>to be left till called for.</q> This time the burden
went to Lyons, and when the body was found sus-
picion fell upon Domby's friend, Calloux, who had
brought the wooden case and had trundled it to the
railway station, not knowing what it contained.
Domby's guilt was brought home to him.</p>

<p>A terrible example of callousness is that of a young
man named Vitalis and a girl Marie Boyer, who
killed the former's mother and remained seated on
<pb n="314"/>
the box containing their victim the whole of the
day.</p>

<p>The murder of Gouffée by Jean Eyraud and Gabrielle
Bombard was one of the most deliberately diabolical
conceptions that can be cited. But, in spite of their
elaborate precautions and the use of a trunk, the
guilt of the assassins was established.</p>

<p>America can claim two notable instances of box
crimes. In 1841 a man named Samuel Adams was
murdered by John C. Colt, a book-keeper and teacher
of ornamental writing, in an office in the Broadway.
The remains were placed in a box and shipped on
board a vessel bound for New Orleans. But Nemesis
followed as with other crimes of the same kind. The
vessel was unexpectedly delayed for a week, and the
nature of the hideous contents of the packing case
was revealed.</p>

<p>The other instance is that of Alice Augusta Bowlsby,
a charming and beautiful young woman, in whose
death a doctor was implicated. There was a good
deal of mystery in the affair. A woman, accompanied
by a big trunk, alighted from a cab at the terminus
of the Hudson River Railway and asked to have the
trunk sent to Chicago. When she found that there
was no train that night she instantly fled, leaving the
trunk behind her. The murder was speedily dis-
covered, and the doctor in question apprehended
through pieces of the victim's garments marked with
her initials being discovered by the authorities in
his house.</p>

<p>America can also boast of a terrible use to which a
trunk was put by the stupendous villain Holmes, who
murdered wholesale. He utilised a trunk not merely
<pb n="315"/>
to conceal the bodies of his victims, but actually to
take their lives. They were first drugged, then
placed in the trunk, attached to a tube connected
with an ordinary gas-pipe, and thus poisoned.</p>

<p>The box crime in England was revived in 1872 by
the <abbr>Rev.</abbr> John Selby Watson, who, in a fit of passion,
murdered his wife and purchased a trunk to conceal
the deed. He subsequently attempted to commit
suicide, and confessed. what he had done. He was
judged insane, and he ended his days in Broadmoor.</p>

<p>Arthur Devereux, the chemist, who murdered his
wife and two children, introduced a new feature to
get rid of the obvious risks of discovery. He filled
the trunk with cement, and, in addition, took the
most elaborate precautions. Underneath the box lid
was another covering of wooden sections, neatly
fitted together, and with cross-bars screwed, the
whole being glued, sized, and varnished. Notwith-
standing all these precautions, Devereux's guilt was
brought home to him.</p>

<p>The crime of Edgar Edwards was particularly crafty
and atrocious. He entered into negotiations with a
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Darby to purchase the latter's grocery business
in Camberwell, murdered him, his wife and child,
and removed their bodies in two wooden boxes and
a tin trunk to Leytonstone, where they were buried
in the garden of a house which Edwards had just
taken. At this house he attempted to murder a man
named Garland under similar circumstances, and the
matter coming into the hands of the police, they
searched the house, and found business cards bearing
Darby's name. This led to the conviction of the
miscreant.</p>

<pb n="316"/>
<p>It was an American who was responsible for the
Saratoga trunk netted by accident in Lake Como
by some fishermen. The trunk contained the body
of a handsome young woman, who was identified as
a <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Charlton on a honeymoon tour with her husband.
Charlton was captured in New York and confessed
to the crime, which he said was due to a violent quarrel
he had had with his wife. He declared that after
the murder he packed the body in the trunk at mid-
night and carried the trunk on his back to the lake.
Charlton was a slightly-built man and the police
doubted his capability of bearing such a burden.
It was never proved, however, that he had any
accomplice.</p>

<p>The Harley Street Mystery can hardly be called
a box crime, yet in a way it is, as well as appertaining
in another aspect to the case of Matilda Hacker.
The house had been in the possession of a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hen-
riques for some years. Servants had come and gone,
but the establishment was always well ordered, and
the house was not, as that in the Hacker Mystery,
left to take care of itself. It appears that in 1878
the butler left, and his successor had been in his post
a year and a half when he noticed a disagreeable smell
in one of the cellars in the front of the house. These
cellars were three in number and were built under
the pavement, an area separating them from the
house. Eventually search was made, and in a recess
in one of the cellars was found a cask apparently filled
with old bottles. On removing the upper layer, the
body of a woman was discovered rammed into the
cask. The doctors decided that she was middle-aged,
poorly dressed, and had been in the receptacle quite
<pb n="317"/>
a year. And this is all that can be said. From that
day to this the secrecy surrounding the gruesome
find has never been penetrated.</p>

<p>Attempts to hide bodies in places other than trunks
have proved equally abortive. Some of these attempts
are fixed in the public mind, such as the cases of
Eugene Aram, William Corder (of Red Barn fame),
the Mannings, Henry Wainwright and in our own
day, Crippen. Among other instances of disappointed
ingenuity in this direction may be mentioned that of
Captain Bolton, a gentleman farmer of Bulmer, a
village near Castle Howard, Yorkshire, who strangled
Elizabeth Rainbow, a young maidservant in his
employ, and buried her body in a cellar which he filled
with earth. It was of no avail. Elizabeth had been
missing a fortnight when search was made, and
owing to Bolton falling into Wainwright's blunder
of employing assistance, his crime was brought to
light. The ghastly story of John Holloway, his
wife's murderer, is not yet <choice><corr>forgotten</corr><sic>forgotton</sic></choice> by some of
the older residents at Rottingdean, near Brighton.
The woman was strangled in a little house in a lonely
place called Donkey Row. Her body was cut up,
a portion buried in the Lovers' Walk, a picturesque
spot in the outskirts of Rottingdean, and the head
and the remainder of the body beneath the floor of
an outhouse at Margaret Street, where Holloway
was living. The discovery was not made until nearly
a month after the murder, and many more months
might have gone over but for the wretch's
carelessness in leaving a fragment of a red stuff
gown protruding above the soil in the Lovers'
Walk.</p>

<pb n="318"/>
<p>The body of William Huntley, murdered in a wood
near Yarm, Yorkshire, remained undisturbed for
eleven years, and was discovered by some workmen
making some alterations in the course of a brook in
the wood. The position of the bones was very singular.
A hole had not been dug in the horizontal surface
of the ground but the side of the brook was excavated,
the body thrust in and the excavation closed. As
with <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Parkman and O'Connor, identification was
furnished through the teeth, a long projecting tooth
in the lower jaw being at once recognised by Huntley's
friends. A man named Robert Goldsborough was
arrested and tried for murder, but though the evidence
was very strong against him it was not sufficient to
prove his guilt. <q>Can they try me again, lad?</q>
Goldsborough, after he was found not guilty, whispered
to the officer at his side. <q>No, thou'st clear of it
altogether,</q> was the reply. Goldsborough drew a
long breath and said <q>If they'd put me on trial
eleven years ago I'd ha' got plenty to coom forrard
and clear me,</q> which, under the circumstances, was
a remarkably safe thing to say. Whether it was true
is another matter. By the side of the above notor-
ieties, Daniel Good, who concealed the body of his
murdered wife for days in a stable at Roehampton,
is but a commonplace person. Of more dramatic
interest is the discovery of the body of Miss Matilda
Hacker in a coal cellar beneath a house in Euston
Square, but the story has been often told and need
not be again detailed.</p>

<p>The list is fittingly ended by that super-monster,
William Deeming, who made sure he had hidden his
two wives from mortal ken when, after murdering
<pb n="319"/>
them, he buried them--one in England and the other
in Australia--in the basement of his house and secured
these graves with a covering of cement. He was
wrong.</p>

<p>If any general principle can be deduced from the
foregoing classification of murders, it would seem that
for the murderer greater safety lies in simplicity
than in elaboration. The trite saying, <q>Murder
will out</q> is mostly used in a wrong sense. <q>Murder</q>
itself, it may be admitted, will <q>out,</q> as a rule, but
this is nothing. It is the murderer which counts.
As will be seen from the examples cited in these pages.
he frequently refuses to <q>out.</q> It may, however,
be said that, to ensure the success of an unpremeditated
murder, chance or luck must favour the perpetrator.
Obviously, chance or luck cannot be depended upon
in murders more than in anything else, and by this
uncertainty the murderer is considerably handicapped.</p>

<p>Luck or no luck, there remains the puzzle that,
while in some murders everything may conspire to
help the murderer without his connivance, in others,
the slightest attempt to throw his pursuers off the
scent brings about his detection. There may be a
law which governs these matters, but until this law
is discovered, so long shall we be faced with <q>Unsolved
Murder Mysteries.</q></p>
