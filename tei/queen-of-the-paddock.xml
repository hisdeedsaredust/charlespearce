<p><said>Madame's coffee is ready.</said></p>

<p>A smothered response from the picture-bed, with its
silken hangings and lace pillows, an impatient move-
ment of the round shoulders. Silence, broken by the
whisking of Fifine's skirts as she turned to open the
window, and the persiennes outside.</p>

<p>Five minutes of silence and blazing sunlight, and
Fifine spoke again.</p>

<p><said>Madame's coffee is getting cold.</said></p>

<p>Madame probably found the sunlight somewhat
trying. The long, dark lashes slowly parted and
disclosed a pair of large blue Irish eyes--beautiful
eyes undoubtedly, innocent-looking or wicked just
as the owner pleased. At this moment they were
languid and slightly weary. The corners of the hand-
some audacious mouth were curved a little downwards.
<abbr>Mdme.</abbr> Violetta Vaughan, generally known as <abbr>Mdme.</abbr>
Violetta, and not infrequently as <q>Violetta</q> alone,
had had a restless night.</p>

<p><said>Chartreuse, Fifine, and the eau de Cologne spray,</said>
said she in a tired voice.</p>

<p>The first was dropped into the coffee, the second was
showered on the lady's forehead.</p>

<p>Under these stimulating and refreshing influences
<abbr>Mdme.</abbr> Violetta revived somewhat and asked for the
English papers.</p>

<pb n="6"/>
<p>The season at Monte Carlo was almost over; all
the gamblers, or nearly all, had departed, the hotels
were rapidly discharging their waiters, the sun was
gaining power, the air was becoming stifling, and the
heat unbearable.</p>

<p><abbr>Mdme.</abbr> Violetta had stayed on simply because she
had no plans; but she would have to do something,
and so she had sent for the English papers to gain
inspiration.</p>

<p>Her eyes went listlessly over the columns. She
saw nothing that interested her or that suggested a
welcome change from the aridity and dullness of the
Riviera in the summer months. Besides, the paper
was nearly a year old!</p>

<p>She was about to throw it aside with an impatient
little <foreign xml:lang="fr">moue</foreign> when her attitude, her expression of lassitude,
suddenly changed. She had caught sight of a paragraph
which had taken her memory back a few years.</p>

<p>The paragraph which had brought about such a
magical transformation was in a column of <q>Society
<choice><abbr>pars</abbr><expan>paragraphs</expan></choice>,</q> and ran thus:--<q>Sir John Norman, whose
health after his recent bereavement has caused great
anxiety to his numerous friends, has left town with
his sister Miss Ella Norman, for Normanhurst, his
picturesque mansion in Sussex. We understand he
intends presenting a stained-glass window to Norman-
hurst Church in memory of the late Lady Norman.</q></p>

<p>The deep blue eyes sparkled, the red lips curved
mockingly.</p>

<p><said>Bereavement--ill health--stained glass window!
How funny,</said> laughed the lady. <said>Why, the woman
had for ten years been what the world is pleased to
term mentally afflicted.</said></p>

<p>Then amusement departed from the beautiful face
and thought took its place.</p>

<p>Five years before Violetta Vaughan was a pupil
teacher at a fashionable boarding-school in Eastbourne.
She had been admitted on what is called <q>mutual
<pb n="7"/>
terms.</q> In return for her intimate acquaintance with
French and German, to be available, for the school
in general, she had received instruction in music, drawing,
and other <soCalled>extras</soCalled> which go to make up a <soCalled>finishing
education.</soCalled></p>

<p>But it was not solely for these accomplishments that
Violetta had been sent to Montpellier House. Captain
Vaughan, her father, who if he never seemed to be
blest with this world's coin, had plenty of the world's
wisdom and experience, told his daughter to make
advantageous acquaintances among the aristocratic
pupils, and she had not failed to take the parental advice.</p>

<p>Ella Norman, one of these aristocratic young ladies,
at the end of her last term invited Violetta to spend
the summer vacation at Normanhurst. Violetta
accepted the invitation gratefully, and as part of her
vocation was to make herself agreeable and as she
had in addition a great capacity for getting all the
enjoyment out of life that came in her way, she
thoroughly ingratiated herself with the whole household,
and especially with Sir John Norman.</p>

<p>She had not been twenty-four hours in the old mansion
before her quick brain had summed up the character of
the baronet.</p>

<p><q>Easy-going--good-natured--susceptible--could
be fooled by any pretty woman who likes to take the
trouble to flatter him,</q> was her summary, and she
was not far out.</p>

<p>But what was the use of her wasting her blandishments
when they were likely to lead to nothing? To begin
with, Sir John was married. He was also a grass
widower, but in his case a loosening of the marriage
tie made no difference, and Violetta had not been long
at Normanhurst before she discovered this. Not
that it mattered very much to her. She was by no
means anxious for married life.</p>

<p>Lady Norman was then a patient in a doctor's house
and likely to remain one. Her brain was affected.
<pb n="8"/>
She had delusions and among them was an intense
jealousy of her husband. She had been pronounced
incurable.</p>

<p>The baronet, poor man, had never given his wife the
slightest cause for uneasiness. He had been brought up
strictly and he had naturally a profound respect for
the proprieties, and a hatred of scandal. He was not
blessed (or cursed) with strong passions, and no one
was less likely than he to figure in the divorce court.</p>

<p>At this time Violetta was a young woman of twenty-
two and of fascinating manners. Though she had not
long since arrived at years of discretion she had acquired
an intimate acquaintance with the underworld of
civilised life, which few to look at her would have
suspected. During her teens and until her father
elected to prepare her for another sphere in which to
exercise her talents, she had had few acquaintances
outside the <soCalled>horsey</soCalled> circle of which <abbr>Capt.</abbr> Vaughan
was the moving spirit. Some of the members were
very shady individuals and it was doubtful whether
the gallant captain himself could be said to reach a
high standard of respectability.</p>

<p>The extraordinary thing was that Violetta never
betrayed that she had once rubbed shoulders with a
stratum of society represented by men and women
whose only occupation appeared to be to haunt race
courses and restaurants.</p>

<p>Violetta Vaughan and Ella Norman got on fairly
well together. There was only three years difference
between their ages, and Violetta never made the mistake
of presuming upon her seniority. Besides, she had
infinite tact and was really clever and amusing. She
had had some years' experience of Paris, and could
sing little French songs with all the verve and gesture
of a caf√© chantant star. But she was always very
discreet in her selection and performance when Sir
John was present.</p>

<p>Violetta enjoyed herself immensely at Normanhurst.
<pb n="9"/>
She was passionately fond of horses and rode as one
to the manner born. Sir John Norman had a stable
of fine hunters, and when he showed her his stud he
was amazed at her knowledge of horseflesh, and her
shrewdness in pointing out the good qualities and the
defects of the various animals.</p>

<p>He was still more amazed at her boldness and dexterity
in the hunting field. But her father had been a cavalry
officer, and after he left the army had, among other
speculations, started a riding school, and from her
earliest years Violetta had been used to the saddle.</p>

<p>Violetta left Normanhurst with the promise made
both to Ella and Sir John (who showed great warmth
in his invitation) to repeat her visit at no distant date.</p>

<p>She intended to keep her word, but the unexpected
happened. A crisis came in her life, and she turned
her back on respectability--at least, what is so termed
in England. Abroad, manners and ideas are more
elastic.</p>

<p>It was all through that ne'er-do-well father of hers.
He had been thriftless, and unscrupulous, and when
in the army he had gone through the Boer War with
credit so far as mere fighting was concerned, but on
his return to England, it had been found necessary
for him to throw up his commission to prevent awkward
consequences. It was suspected that at cards his
luck was more than phenomenal.</p>

<p>After many vicissitudes he ran a sort of gambling
and betting club. This was soon after Violetta's visit
to Normanhurst. She had had enough of pupil teaching,
she had acquired the smart society air, and <abbr>Capt.</abbr>
Vaughan saw how useful she could be to him.</p>

<p>He gauged her determination and business capacity
correctly, and he had no hesitation in placing her in
charge of the buffet at the club. He knew she could
take care of herself without losing any of her fascination.
She had the power of keeping the rather rowdy members
in their place. Sometimes a new man attracted by her
<pb n="10"/>
striking appearance endeavoured to pay her obtrusive
attention. He soon found out his mistake.</p>

<p>Apart from her management of the buffet she took
a great interest in the race course. She was as well
up in betting mysteries as the most expert turfite, and
if she cared she would have been a most successful
bookmaker. The same with cards. There was not
a game which she did not know from A to Z. Few
could beat her at <q>poker</q> or <q>bridge,</q> if she held
the cards, but she was nearly always unlucky.</p>

<p>She was a puzzle to men. When she was in the
mood, she could flirt as few women could, but with
her it was much the same as playing a game of cards.
She would lead a man on, only to treat him with in-
difference.</p>

<p>Was she capable of love? No one could tell. She
was an enigma. Yet there were moments when a
light flashed in the mystic eyes which served to say
that deep in her nature were the elements of a fire
which if kindled might blaze up with irresistible force.</p>

<p>One morning before the members began to drop in
and when Violetta was making preparations for the
day's business, Captain Vaughan sauntered in smoking
a cigar. Said he in a casual way:</p>

<p><said>This show's cracked up, Vi.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm not surprised,</said> she rejoined, quite as cool as
her father. <said>What are you going to do?</said></p>

<p><said>Scoot. Paris. How does that suit you?</said></p>

<p><said>It's what you should have done long ago. I told
you the club was not swell enough to bring you in
any money. It's too low down and always will be.</said></p>

<p><said>You've hit the right nail on the head, my girl, as
you generally do. No chance of airing your graces
and accomplishments. They're wasted here. A pity,
too, after laying in a stock of <soCalled>high tone</soCalled> at that
Eastbourne place.</said></p>

<p>Violetta shrugged her shapely shoulders, and a gleam
shot into her eyes as much as to say that there was
<pb n="11"/>
still plenty of time to show what talent she possessed.</p>

<p>She was glad the club had come to an end. She
hated the men with whom she had to mix. They were
most of them <soCalled>bookies</soCalled> and hangers-on of the turf
in various capacities. Many of them were somewhat
mysterious in their ways, and what they did for a living
in the off season when racing was over was only known
to themselves.</p>

<p>Occasionally men of a different character found
their way into the club, or, to speak correctly, were
introduced. They were chiefly young fools who, with
more money than brains, were <soCalled>seeing life,</soCalled> often
at bitter cost to their pockets and health. Some of
them were of the vulgar rich variety, and these Violetta
effectually kept at a distance, and left them to fool
themselves to the top of their bent. Others were of
good birth and sowed their wild oats out of a super-
abundance of high spirits. They had no vice; they
were simply reckless, and when Violetta took sufficient
interest in any of them she whispered warnings against
certain members of the club--warnings which somehow
got known to the riffraff, whose deadly hatred she
incurred accordingly.</p>

<p>Violetta held her own and was indifferent to what
these disreputable personages thought of her, but the
life was not pleasant, and she was heartily tired of it.
So she gladly went off with her father to Paris that
Paris she knew so well and loved as a child and where
she felt more at home than in London.</p>

<p>The journey was a secret and a hurried one. Captain
Vaughan scraped together all the money he could
lay hold of and established himself in Paris as a
<soCalled>prophet.</soCalled> He was possessed of a list of the names
and addresses of English patrons of the turf, and he
got together a number of subscribers to his weekly
racing sheet. He might have done well, but he chose
to buy a steeplechaser and pose as a gentleman rider.
He broke his neck at <choice><corr>Auteuil</corr><orig>Autueil</orig></choice>.</p>

<pb n="12"/>
<p>Violetta backed horses and systematically disregarded
her father's tips. Perhaps that was why she frequently
won. After Captain Vaughan's death, she took a
dislike to the betting fraternity, but the gambling spirit
was strong within her and she went off to Monte Carlo
to try her luck at the Casino.</p>

<p>But the good fortune that attended her on the turf
deserted her at the gaming table. She struggled half
way through the season and came to the end of her
resources.</p>

<p>Then in some curious way it got whispered about
that though she had, to use her own words, <q>infernally
bad luck,</q> yet she brought luck to others.</p>

<p>With her usual shrewdness she utilised this reputation
of <choice><corr>hers</corr><orig>her's</orig></choice>--she became a <soCalled>Mascotte</soCalled> and she found it
pay. Of course, she could not always win, but certain
it was that when she staked for other people her luck
was amazing, and at times she was loaded with presents.
<q>La Mascotte, Violetta,</q> became the rage.</p>

<p>The paper dropped from her hand as the serious look
came into her eyes, and she rang the bell impatiently.</p>

<p><said>Fifine,</said> she cried, <said>pack up at once. I leave to-day
for Paris.</said></p>

<p><said>Madame!</said> exclaimed the startled maid.</p>

<p><said>I spoke plainly, didn't I? I'm tired of posing as a
<soCalled>mascotte</soCalled> for other people. I am going to play
the part for myself. Make haste. To-day I bid farewell
for ever to Monte Carlo. No more rouge-et-noir--no
more Russian Princes with Tartar faces and French
Counts with tigerish eyes. England, Fifine, Eng-
land!</said></p>

<p><said>Madame will kill herself with ennui and the fog,</said>
said Fifine, with a shrug of her pretty round shoulders.</p>

<p>But she packed Madame's trunks nevertheless.</p>

<p>Violetta went through her hotel account and her
exchequer. The first was larger and the second was
smaller than she expected. She had enough to leave
Monaco with a clear conscience and to pay her fare
<pb n="13"/>
to England, but this by itself did not suffice. She
must have funds when she arrived in London.</p>

<p>All that day she was in a dozen different moods.
She was angry with Fifine about nothing at all one
moment and was almost apologetic the next. The
girl understood perfectly well what was the matter.
Madame (Violetta by the way, always termed herself
<q>Madame,</q> and though she never said precisely that
she had been married she allowed people to think so--
the assumption she found gave her more freedom)
was suffering from <q>nerves.</q></p>

<p>The emotional Fifine was considerate and sympathetic.
Who would not be in a bad temper at the thought of
exchanging the sunny skies and the gaiety of the Riviera
for the smoke and drabness of London? The girl
was not a bit surprised when her mistress suddenly
announced that she intended to defer her departure
until the next day.</p>

<p><q>I shall go to the Casino to-night</q> she declared.</p>

<p>The step was a desperate one, but what other way
was there?</p>

</div>


<div n="2" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter II</head>
<head type="main">The Magic of a <soCalled>Mascotte</soCalled></head>

<p>The opalescent sky was unflecked by a single cloud.
The moon shone so brightly that everything was revealed
as distinctly as though it were day. The shadows where
ever they were cast were as black as ink, and their
very blackness seemed to accentuate the light elsewhere.</p>

<p>Violetta hurried through the Casino gardens indifferent
to everything save her resolve to <soCalled>plunge,</soCalled> whatever
might be the outcome. The flamboyant nondescript
architecture of the Casino with its elaborate ornamented
<pb n="14"/>
front and dual towers did not appeal to her, picturesque
though it looked now that its vulgarities were subdued
by the pale light of the moon. The trim garden where
European and Eastern shrubs grew with equal luxuriance
might have been a wilderness for any thought she
bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>Signs of the waning season were evident in the small
numbers of visitors strolling towards the Casino and
promenading the terrace overlooking the mirror-like
sea. There was hardly a breath of wind to disturb
the heated air. The refreshing coolness of the night
was gone. Before many days had passed Monte Carlo
so delightful in the winter, would be unendurable.</p>

<p>As Violetta drew near the portals of the Casino she
heard the faint sound of music. It came from the opera
house; part of the attractions of the famous gambling
resort. <q>Carmen</q> was being played. The opera
was a favourite with Violetta but it did not detain
her now. Within a minute or two she had entered the
gambling salon.</p>

<p>There were not many punters, the usual tourists
had had their fling, had spent their available cash and
had departed, some back to the decorum and monotony
of the warehouse, the counting house, and the stock
exchange; others to make up their losses at rouge-
et-noir, with the opening of flat racing--or to increase
them.</p>

<p>Violetta cast a rapid glance round the table. Had
she chosen to assume her old role of <soCalled>Mascotte</soCalled> she
would have had small opportunities. The princes
and grand dukes, Russian, Rumanian and Bulgarian
had departed. A few fat Belgian manufacturers and
merchants remained, but they had no imagination,
they did not believe in <soCalled>mascottes.</soCalled> As for the women,
Violetta had never found them patronise her. To
begin with, she was too good looking, and apart from
this, the women gamblers generally looked upon each
other with hatred and jealousy. Had it been otherwise
<pb n="15"/>
these ladies who were seated at the table had far too
profound a belief in their own judgment to trust to
that of others.</p>

<p>There they were now, old painted harridans with
the faces of hawks and the necks of vultures; middle-
aged matrons, most of them running to fat, and young
women, outrageously <foreign xml:lang="fr">d&#xe9;collet&#xe9;</foreign>, worn, haggard, and old
before their time.</p>

<p>But whatever might be their faces and figures, they
all had the same look in their eyes--the strained, eager,
glassy concentrated stare of the inveterate gambler.
The excitement of play had become part of their lives--
it might also be said of their deaths.</p>

<p>It was, Violetta considered, a most uninteresting
crowd. She knew the types by heart. Nor were the
visitors wandering about or standing gazing at the
revolving, fateful little ball, and the rakes of the croupiers
like the extended claws of some gigantic carrion bird,
less so. She took a vacant seat and watched the
fluctuations of the game before she chanced her luck.</p>

<p>The room big as it was, was intensely hot. The
silence, broken only by the monotonous voice of the
croupier with his eternal <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">Rien ne va plus,</foreign></q> followed
by the proclamation of the winning colour, was
oppressive. Both were getting on her nerves, she
would not be able to retain her impatience much longer.</p>

<p>She had no belief in systems, she had seen too many
come to grief in horse racing circles, but she could not
help counting the number of times red had won. A
sequence of six had brought luck to a few. Would it be
maintained to the next round, the mystic number of
seven? She was strongly tempted, but she who hesitates
is lost, she delayed and was half a second too late.
The decisive <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">Rien ne va plus</foreign></q> had beaten her, again
red was declared.</p>

<p>It could go on no longer she told herself, and when
the time came for placing the stakes she threw down a
100 franc note on the black. She saw it swept away.
<pb n="16"/>
It was no consolation to her that a man standing behind
her chair had lost ten times more than she had.</p>

<p>She was angered but not discouraged. She ventured
another 100 francs again on the black. The man
behind her did not stake.</p>

<p><q>Much wiser to cut your losses at once</q> she heard
him whisper.</p>

<p>And so it would have been. Once more she lost.
She was the poorer by 200 francs, and she wanted to
make at least a thousand.</p>

<p>Violetta had brought with her 400 francs. It was
inconceivable that red should be eternally the winning
colour. Already eight times! She had never seen
the like of it, surely this monotony could not go on.
If she plunged with all she had got and won, she would
get all she wished for and more. Some mysterious
tempter was urging her on, She would not allow
herself to think, but swiftly dragged out her small
parcel of notes and adhered to the black which had
hitherto played her false.</p>

<p><q>I warned you,</q> said the voice behind.</p>

<p>She made a gesture of impatience; this stranger
who persisted in interfering with his <choice><corr>superfluous</corr><orig>superflous</orig></choice> warnings
was a nuisance. Had she not been so absorbed in
the game she would have administered a sharp rebuke.
But she remained silent, under a strain upon her nerves
which was almost too much for her powers of endurance.
She sat with tightly compressed lips and slowly paling
cheeks watching the revolution of the fiendish little
ball. It moved slower and slower, then seemed to
tremble and be uncertain what to do. It hovered
between red and black. It stopped. Red! Violetta
pushed her chair a few inches from the table, and
remained motionless. She felt as if her heart had
ceased to beat.</p>

<p>Then she rose. The nerve tension and the consequent
re-action had become unbearable. While within the
scene of her disaster and with the mechanical chant of
<pb n="17"/>
the croupier in her ears she could not think. And she
had so much to think about!</p>

<p>She wheeled swiftly round to fly from the hateful
place and came face to face with the man behind her
chair. She had forgotten him, but his presence there
reminded her of his warning. She took a dislike to him
because his warnings had been justified.</p>

<p><q>My chair is at your service,</q> said she coldly.
<q>Perhaps you would like to play according to your
judgment. It seems to have been quite accurate
as far as I'm concerned.</q></p>

<p>She spoke to him in English for he had all the Anglo-
Saxon characteristics.</p>

<p><q>I'm sorry,</q> said he. <q>Have you lost heavily?</q></p>

<p><q>No; I dare say you saw what I staked.</q></p>

<p><q>That isn't the point. The stake doesn't count.
It's what you can afford to lose that matters.</q></p>

<p><q>Then if you care to know, I can afford to lose
nothing.</q></p>

<p>Violetta had not intended to talk so much to a perfect
stranger, especially as when she was gone he would
probably chuckle at her obstinacy in disregarding his
advice. She was about to walk away, but he detained
her.</p>

<p><q>I understand. Pardon me for making the sugges-
tion, but can I help you? My purse is at your disposal.</q></p>

<p><q>No,</q> she flashed.</p>

<p><q>Don't be angry. I mean nothing but a desire to
be of use.</q></p>

<p><q>You can be of no use,</q> she retorted.</p>

<p>A cold, incredulous smile went over his narrow face.
He was a tall, thin wiry man, slightly bent in the
shoulders. His complexion was of an even brownish
tinge--the complexion of one who lived much in the
open air. The narrowness of his features was ac-
centuated by his long straight nose, his thin lips, and
slightly pointed chin. His eyes were grey and quite
expressionless. There was something about him and
<pb n="18"/>
his figure which seemed familiar to her. His whole
appearance took her mind back to the days at her
father's club, and to the race courses at Auteuil and
Chantilly. She knew the cut of a racing man. No
one better.</p>

<p>Again she made a movement to escape his attentions,
but he waved his hand with a gesture of dissent.</p>

<p><q>It might be as well if I told you why you were
wrong in staking a second time. May I?</q></p>

<p><q>For my future benefit, I suppose?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, though I doubt if it will make much difference.
I guess you're a woman who will always go her own way.
You noticed I dare say that I also lost and then ceased
to play.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, you hadn't the courage to go on, I presume,</q>
she rejoined a little contemptuously.</p>

<p><q>Not at all. I was simply acting on a system that's
fairly safe. It was laid down by the founder of the
casino, <abbr>M.</abbr> Blanc.</q></p>

<p><said>An excellent authority since he made a fortune out
of the losses of his patrons,</said> she replied still more scorn-
fully.</p>

<p><q>And therefore he was likely to know. Anyhow, his
advice is worth remembering, and so far as my experience
has gone it is well founded. Of course the real safe
system is never to play, but short of that, said <abbr>M.</abbr> Blanc,
the game is to stake once and once only each night. I've
always adhered to that rule, and I've generally found
myself on the winning side in the long run.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank you. I'll not forget,</q> she returned ironically.
<q>But I fear I shan't be able to test your admirable
method. This is probably my last visit to the tables.
The casino closes next week. I wish you good even-
ing.</q></p>

<p><q>Wait one moment. I've noticed you here many
times but I've never before to-night seen you play.
I'm told you are a wonderful <soCalled>mascotte.</soCalled> Is it
true?</q></p>

<pb n="19"/>
<p><q>That I'm wonderful? I can't say. I've never
thought about it.</q></p>

<p><q>You said just now I'd no courage. I should like
to show you that you're wrong.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, you can easily do that, but you must excuse
me if I do not remain to see you prove your assertion.
I'm not interested one way or the other.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't mean that. I wanted to test my courage
with your assistance. I should like you to act as my
<soCalled>mascotte.</soCalled></q></p>

<p><q>Thank you, but I must refuse. I'm retiring from
the profession.</q></p>

<p>In spite of her words she was interested, not perhaps
in the man himself as in his quiet pertinacity.</p>

<p><q>I congratulate you. At the same time I observe
that you did not say you <emph>had</emph> retired. Please oblige me
once.</q></p>

<p>She hesitated. The talk had done her good. Her
nervous system was recovering its tone. A reckless
indifference had seized her--a not uncommon frame of
mind, as most gamblers who see themselves <soCalled>stony
broke</soCalled> will probably admit.</p>

<p><q>Oh, as you please,</q> she returned carelessly.</p>

<p><q>Thanks. Will you resume your seat? Luck is
with us. There are now two vacant chairs side by side.</q></p>

<p>Violetta shrugged her shoulders and without another
word sat herself down in one seat and her companion
took the other.</p>

<p><q>Which colour is it to be?</q> he asked.</p>

<p><q>I don't know. Wait. I never look at the table
while the mood's on me. It hasn't come yet.</q></p>

<p>She closed her eyes. Five minutes went over. The
man appeared to take as little interest in the table's
fluctuations as she did. His eyes were fixed on her face.
The resting of her eyelids on the smooth cheek gave a
sort of madonna aspect to her face. His eyes seemed
to lose their coldness as he gazed upon her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she spoke.</p>

<pb n="20"/>
<p><q>Red,</q> he heard her whisper. Her eyes remained
closed.</p>

<p>Swiftly he threw a couple of notes on the table. Red
won.</p>

<p><q>Marvellous,</q> said he, as he gathered up his winnings.
<q>Try again. I'm done with my system for to-night at
any rate.</q></p>

<p>Once more a long pause. <q>Black</q> was her next
pronouncement. Black it was. The third time she
was wrong. The fourth and fifth attempts were
correct.</p>

<p><q>That's enough. I'm satisfied. We won't tempt
fortune any further. Your winnings amount to &#xa3;500.</q></p>

<p><q><emph>My</emph> winnings?</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly. I've lost nothing. It all belongs to you.</q></p>

<p><q>Indeed it doesn't. I shall be quite contented with
ten per cent.</q></p>

<p><q>You're very business-like. It is not often that
women reckon by percentages. But this isn't a business
transaction. I look upon it as a challenge, and you've
won. You're entitled to the stakes.</q></p>

<p>He tried to force a bundle of notes upon her, but she
rejected it.</p>

<p><q>If you won a race through a tip you wouldn't
hand over all your gains to the tipster.</q></p>

<p><q>What do you know about racing tips and tipsters?</q>
he enquired, with a note of surprise in his voice.</p>

<p><q>As much as I care to.</q></p>

<p>He would have liked to study her face to read in it
her character but her eyes were wide open and directed
upon him, and he could not be so rude as to stare as her.</p>

<p><q>You're a woman worth knowing. For that reason
you must take this &#xa3;500. I insist upon it.</q></p>

<p><q>Insist as much as you like. Business is business.</q></p>

<p>He was impressed by her decisive, emphatic manner.
He took her at her word.</p>

<p><q>Very well. Let us come to terms. Ten per <abbr>cent.</abbr>
is absurd. Nothing less than half will be fair. Even
<pb n="21"/>
so, I'm &#xa3;250 richer than I was half an hour ago. How
does that strike you?</q></p>

<p>Violetta reflected for a few moments. The sum
was not a penny more than she could do with. After
all, she had earned it. And as he reminded her, he
also had done very well. She consented to the
arrangement.</p>

<p><q>Do we part in this formal fashion?</q> he asked,
as she rose after accepting the notes.</p>

<p><q>Yes. There's nothing more to be said.</q></p>

<p><q>Probably, so far as you're concerned. But what
about me?</q></p>

<p><q>I cannot help you. We've finished our business I
take it.</q></p>

<p>He made no reply and they walked silently to the
vestibule. He continued by her side to the terrace.
A slight mist was rising and the evergreens and the
feathery palms looked fairylike, unreal.</p>

<p><q>How do you work--your mascotte magic, I mean?
How does it come to you?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know. After sitting quietly I have an
impulse--an inspiration, I suppose some people would
call it. That's all I can tell you.</q></p>

<p><q>Strange. Would your inspiration be of any use
in other things--the running at a horse race, for
instance?</q></p>

<p><q>No.</q></p>

<p><q>Why not? The result's the same in both--luck.</q></p>

<p><q>Is it? A dozen things may affect a horse and
decide whether he wins or loses. It's only one thing
with the ball in <foreign xml:lang="fr">rouge et noir</foreign> or roulette. I can't think
of a horse as an inanimate block of wood or ivory.
Besides, I must look at a horse race--I can't help it--
and looking is fatal to my power--if I <emph>have</emph> a power.</q></p>

<p>Violetta had suddenly changed her tone and manner.
Both had lost their coldness. Her natural vivacity
had asserted itself as it always did when she talked
about horses.</p>

<pb n="22"/>
<p><q>I see. So you're fond of racing.</q></p>

<p><q>I love it.</q></p>

<p><q>And horses too. I've seen you riding at Mentone.
You're a splendid horsewoman.</q></p>

<p><q>Am I? You're a good judge, I suppose?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm called one, anyhow.</q></p>

<p>Insensibly they fell into horsey talk. It was the one
subject that Violetta loved to discuss, but only with
those who understood. Soon reminiscences of famous
races at Epsom, Newmarket, Doncaster, in the years
prior to Captain Vaughan's sudden flight to Paris crept
in, and they discovered their recollections coincided.</p>

<p><q>Do you remember Plymouth Rock's running in
the <abbr>St.</abbr> Leger four years ago?</q> suddenly asked
Violetta.</p>

<p>The man's face darkened and his straight brows
contracted.</p>

<p><q>Yes, too well.</q></p>

<p><q>A jockey named Loram was up. He pulled that
race.</q></p>

<p><q>Did he? How do you know?</q></p>

<p><q>It doesn't matter how. I only say he did.</q></p>

<p><q>I won't contradict you because I can't. Had
Loram not run on the cross Plymouth Rock would
have won hands down. No one can speak with better
authority than I for I took odds on the horse.</q></p>

<p><q>You did? What's your name?</q></p>

<p><q>I'll tell you if you tell me yours.</q></p>

<p><q>No. I don't wish to.</q></p>

<p><q>Right; then I'll keep mine to myself.</q></p>

<p>Violetta laughed lightly. She really did not care
who he was She had only asked the question out of
idle <choice><corr>curiosity</corr><orig>curiousity</orig></choice>.</p>

<p><q>I'd better say good-night,</q> she went on after a
pause. <q>Thank you for employing me and for your
liberal commission.</q></p>

<p><q>Is that all you have to say?</q></p>

<p><q>Every word.</q></p>

<pb n="23"/>
<p>She held out her hand, and he could not choose but
take it.</p>

<p><q>I've a favour to ask. Will you dine with me to-
morrow?</q></p>

<p><q>I shall be miles away by then.</q></p>

<p><q>Are you leaving?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. What's the use of staying here any longer?</q></p>

<p><q>Not much. I thought perhaps to-morrow you'd
like to repeat your success of to-night.</q></p>

<p><q>No. I've had enough.</q></p>

<p><q>Where are you going? London?</q></p>

<p><q>I haven't made up my mind. May be and may be
not.</q></p>

<p><q>If you do I hope to see something of you. We
might meet at Epsom or Ascot.</q></p>

<p><q>We might. Ever so many things might happen.
I don't pretend to see into the future.</q></p>

<p><q>I believe you can do much more that way than you
imagine.</q></p>

<p><q>That's possible, too.</q></p>

<p>He was silent for a moment and fingered his chin
reflectively.</p>

<p><q>You <choice><corr>wouldn't</corr><orig>would'nt</orig></choice> care to go into partnership?</q> said
he at last.</p>

<p><q>With you?</q></p>

<p><q>That was in my mind.</q></p>

<p><q>In what way?</q></p>

<p><q>Purely business.</q></p>

<p><q>You are still on the turf then?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes.</q></p>

<p>Violetta's eyes went over his hard face.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> said she with decision. <q>Good-night.</q></p>

<p>He did not attempt to persuade her to remain with
him, and for this she was grateful. She was anxious
to return to her rooms and give Fifine her final
instructions.</p>

<p>So they parted, and he watched her glide away until
her graceful figure was lost in the black shadows.</p>

<head type="num">Chapter III</head>
<head type="main"><q>Vi. Vaughan or Her Ghost, and Handsomer
than ever</q></head>

<p>Violetta knew her Paris. She did not bother about
the expensive hotels, but made straight for the Hotel
Provence, an old-world establishment south of the
Seine and not far from the Boulevard <abbr>St.</abbr> Michel and
its caf&#xe9;s, dear to the hearts of Bohemian students.</p>

<p>She had stayed at the hotel more than once and was
practically an old friend of <abbr>M.</abbr> Octave Lange, the fat
good-humoured bald-headed proprietor. He welcomed
her with effusion. She had on several occasions proved
highly useful to him in acting as an interpreter when
English or American tourists found their way to the
Hotel Provence. Whether through disinclination or
incapacity Octave Lange had not been able to acquire
more than one or two English phrases, and these were
so tinged with a Gallic pronunciation as to be almost
unintelligible. So he had found the services of <soCalled>Mees
Vown</soCalled> exceedingly valuable, and he showed his
gratitude by the smallness of his charges.</p>

<p>By good luck her old room on the ground floor was
free. It opened into a quaint stone-paved courtyard
flanked by high ivy covered walls on two sides, and
with a solitary plane tree which did its best to flourish
under adverse circumstances in the centre. In the
days of Louis Quatorze the Hotel Provence had been a
stately mansion, and some remains of its former grandeur
yet remained in the size of the rooms, the queer way
in which they opened one into the other, and in the
carvings and decorations of the walls and ceilings.</p>

<p><q>Would Mademoiselle be having her piano?</q> was
<abbr>M.</abbr> Lange's enquiry the day after she had taken up
<pb n="25"/>
her quarters. <soCalled>Mees Vown's</soCalled> playing, he had dis-
covered, added to the attractions of his establishment.
He liked to hear some of his <foreign xml:lang="fr">pensionats</foreign> ask who was the
brilliant pianist whose music was looked forward to
with so much pleasure.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle considered. So much depended upon
how long she intended to stay. For the moment she
had formulated no plans. But she would want some
kind of occupation on those evenings when she was
not in the mood for theatre going, and she decided
to hire an instrument week by week. <abbr>M.</abbr> Lange beamed
with satisfaction.</p>

<p>The life at the Hotel Provence was placid and un-
eventful, but not monotonous. The homely table
d'hote was grateful to her after the feverish excitement
of the Monte Carlo banquets. The visitors amused
her--some of them--those from the provinces especially,
with their quaint <foreign xml:lang="fr">patois</foreign>, the mixture of caution and
simplicity of their ideas, and the women's antiquated
dresses. Everything was such a contrast to what she
had been accustomed to during the winter at the
Riviera.</p>

<p>The weeks flew by and she had not made up her mind
what should be her next step. One thing was certain.
She could not live for ever on what she had brought
from Monte Carlo. Still her expenses were now so
small, it would last a considerable time.</p>

<p>Sir John Norman was constantly in her thoughts, but
was it worth while troubling about him? She liked
the easy-going baronet and she knew perfectly well
that if he were free she had but to give him the slightest
encouragement and he would ask her to be his wife.
His sister would probably not like it, but would that
matter very much? Violetta could not see that it
would. The point was, could she tie herself up to a
man she only liked?</p>

<p>There was, she owned, one strong inducement for a
marriage with Sir John Norman--the splendid stabling
<pb n="26"/>
equipment at Normanhurst, its paddocks and training
grounds. Sir John had bred hunters; why shouldn't
he turn his attention to breeding racers? Horses were
quite a passion with her, and she cared for no sport as
she cared for horse racing. It was her ambition to
be a successful owner, and above all to be the proud
possessor of the Blue Riband of the turf!</p>

<p>Sir John might be cajoled into the idea. Violetta
believed she could cajole him into anything. Ella
would most likely be the obstacle. She was dreamy,
sentimental, fond of poring over poetry of the extreme
modern school, of sketching, and went mad over artists.
Ella always belonged to a <soCalled>cult</soCalled> of some kind--
of what kind Violetta never cared to enquire, and it
might have been theosophy, spiritualism, the abolition
of marriage as the only way of reforming the iniquitous
laws of divorce, or the worship of Omar Khayam for
anything she knew. At all events, Ella took not the
slightest interest in horses and hated races.</p>

<p>But supposing Sir John was not to be talked into
racing? If this should prove to be the case the card
house of her ambition would be shattered. She certainly
did not care for the baronet sufficiently to marry him
for his own sake. Their temperaments were wholly
antagonistic. Violetta was restless and fiery, Sir John
was placid and rather inclined to laze. His brain was
sluggish compared with hers. Besides--and perhaps
this secretly weighed with her more than anything--
she was not drawn towards matrimony. She revelled
in her independence.</p>

<p>After a time she tired of Paris and she tired of her
irresolution. Whatever might come of it, she would
renew her acquaintance with Sir John Norman. At
the worst he might serve as a stepping stone into the
world of well-to-do and maybe aristocratic turf
enthusiasts. Never would she drift back into the
ranks of her father's shady associates. Before her
determination vanished, she sat down and wrote:</p>

<pb n="27"/>
<p><q>Dearest Ella,--I wonder if you've forgotten your
old friend? So much happens in this little world in
a short time that it wouldn't surprise me if much more
important things than our old friendship had driven
me from your mind. Have you found the man who
loves you? Are you married? I've often wondered.
As for me, I'm much the same--a rolling stone that's
gathered very little moss. Since my poor father died--
he was thrown when riding in a steeple chase--I've
had all kinds of posts and the only result is a little
more experience of the world, which I don't know that
I particularly wanted. Anyhow, I feel strongly tempted
to try my luck in London, and I should love dearly
to see you again. Do drop me a line here to say that
I may hope to do so. I shall be in Paris for quite a
fortnight and indeed would wait there for your reply.
Otherwise your letter might go wandering about and
never be forwarded to me in London, where at present
I've no address. How is Sir John? I often think
of the pleasant time I had at Normanhurst. With
love, I am, yours sincerely, your old chum, Violetta
Vaughan.</q></p>

<p>She read the letter over twice and was satisfied.
She meant it simply as a diplomatic feeler. She
purposely omitted mentioning the paragraph which
told her of Lady Norman's death. Not on any account
would she have Ella suspect her plans, and less still
let her know what she had been doing during the last
five years. She posted the letter, addressing it to
Normanhurst, and for the next few days was in a fever
of impatience for an answer.</p>

<p>The fortnight she had given herself went over, but
no letter came from Ella.</p>

<p><q>What does it mean?</q> Violetta asked herself
angrily. <q>I suppose she intends to drop me. If she
does she'd have a good excuse. I ought to have written
at once on the death of poor old dad. But I thought
she might have looked upon it as an attempt to sponge
<pb n="28"/>
upon her. She knew perfectly well I was always more
or less hard up.</q></p>

<p>She wondered if the letter would reach her friend.
Ella might be travelling abroad with her brother.
Naturally, the death of Lady Norman would make a
difference, if not so much to her, certainly to Sir John.</p>

<p><q>Perhaps she'll consider it her duty to watch over
him and protect him from designing women. He'll
need it. He's one of the men who are lost without
a wife, and drawing a blank in his first plunge in the
marriage sweepstakes wouldn't prevent him trying
again. I won't bother any more about him. There'll
be Kempton Park at Easter, and I ought to be in London.
With &#xa3;200 one might do something. I see nothing else
in view.</q></p>

<p>But the next day changed her opinion. She received
Ella Norman's answer. Her face grew grave as she
read:</p>

<p><q>Dearest Violetta,--It was a delightful surprise
to see your handwriting again. As you say, much
has happened since we last met, and so much that was,
and still is, miserable, that I can hardly bear to write
about it. The death of poor Alice in the doctor's house
where she has dragged out her miserable existence for
so long can scarcely be considered a misfortune.
Indeed, it was a happy release, but it came too late to
be of any relief to poor John. Of course, while she
was alive she was a source of constant anxiety to him,
but for some time previous to her death he could not
have thought much about her. He had too many
other worries on his mind. And yet in a way Alice
was at the bottom of the trouble. Soon after you went
I noticed a change in him. He moped horribly. He
seemed to crave for excitement, and this was so strange,
for he always appeared to be happy with his horses
and dogs and pottering about with his farming stock.
Then he suddenly changed again. He had alternate
fits of melancholy and buoyancy, and I don't know
<pb n="29"/>
which troubled me most. The explanation came
eventually. He had taken to betting, and lost over
and over again, and was heavily in debt. I can't go
into particulars now, but I shall be only too thankful
to pour my troubles into your sympathetic ears. When
are you coming to England? Yours very sincerely,
Ella.</q></p>

<p><q><abbr>P.S.</abbr>--Your letter was forwarded here from Norman-
hurst, or of course I should have replied long ago.
About the man--I don't know.</q></p>

<p><q>That means she <emph>is</emph> engaged or about to be,</q> thought
Violetta.</p>

<p>She tossed the letter on the table impatiently. Ella's
engagement was of no importance, but Sir John Norman
with his recklessness, his ill luck, was a different matter.
She was sorry for him, and angry with herself for not
accepting five years before his pressing invitation to
stay.</p>

<p><q>I daresay things would have turned out differently,</q>
she told herself. <q>But it wouldn't have done while
his wife was alive. I believe I hate scandal as much
as he does--at any rate, I've come to hate it.</q></p>

<p>And this was true. Her experience at Monte Carlo
in this direction was a bitter one. She knew very well
she was hated by all the neurotic lady gamesters, old,
young, and middle-aged, and that she was a perennial
subject of venomous gossip. Her luck for others had
raised up hosts of enemies. It would not have mattered
so much had the luck been for the benefit of her own
pocket.</p>

<p><q>It's no consolation, I suppose, that I've nothing to
reproach myself with. I went into the <soCalled>mascotte</soCalled>
business with my eyes open, so I can't be surprised
at the lies told about me.</q></p>

<p>Violetta shrugged her shoulders and her straight brows
wrinkled slightly as was their wont when her mind
was disturbed.</p>

<p>She took the letter up again. Ella had written from
<pb n="30"/>
the Willows, Thameside, up the river, not far from
Bray.</p>

<p><q>Shall I go? Not much good now that the poor
man has anticipated my plans. I wonder if he ran
his own horses?</q></p>

<p>She could not decide offhand what to do, and she
went out to collect her thoughts. She wandered along
the southern bank of the Seine gazing absently at
the bookstalls, at the gaily painted little steamers,
at the patient anglers increasing in numbers as she
drew near Charenton, waiting for fish that never
came.</p>

<p>When she returned to the Hotel Provence she looked
in at the proprietor's little room.</p>

<p><q>My stay here, Monsieur Lange, has come to an
end. I want to leave to-morrow. I'm going to
London.</q></p>

<p>Monsieur was desolated and almost pitying. He was
a born Parisian and rooted to his native city. He
could not conceive existence out of Paris, and in
England, of all places in the world.</p>

<p>But he raised no difficulty and the next morning
Violetta received a neatly written bill of her expenses.
The amount was moderate. Violetta paid it with
many thanks, tipped the garcon, the femme de chambre
and the chef liberally, and departed from the hotel the
best of friends with everybody.</p>

<p>Arrived at Charing Cross, she had her luggage de-
posited at the cloak room while she engaged a room
at one of the private hotels abounding in the streets
on the south side of the Strand. She wandered into
Trafalgar Square. Despite its reputation as being the
finest site in Europe, it was just as bare and ugly as
she remembered it and the National Gallery as squat
and contemptible as ever. London here had not changed
a bit. She turned eastwards. The Strand seemed
strangely narrow after the Paris Boulevards, the people
were apparently wholly intent on business and without
<pb n="31"/>
the air of abandon and interest in the surroundings
which marks a continental crowd. A feeling of solitude
and friendlessness crept over her. She was beginning
to wish she had not left Paris.</p>

<p>Then she roused herself and in a business-like manner
went through the tiresome task of selecting rooms,
impressing managers and manageresses with the con-
viction that she was a young lady who knew her way
about and was not to be imposed upon. Finally, she
settled upon her hotel and had her luggage conveyed
thither. Then after a rest and sleep (she had crossed
from Dieppe by the night boat and was dead tired),
she made a careful toilette, wrote to Ella to say she
would run down to The Willows very shortly, and
sallied forth to lunch.</p>

<p>She went as if by instinct to a restaurant hardly a
stone's throw from Piccadilly Circus. It was her
father's favourite haunt when he was in funds. She
glanced round. She might have lunched there yesterday.
Nothing had altered. The same crimson velvet couches
and marble-topped tables. The same little bar
at the end, presided over by the same impassive,
quietly-dressed lady, the same waiters. She recognised
at least half a dozen. The men and women lunching
might have been the same. The type of patrons was
monotonous in its characteristics. The only innovation
was the number of women with cigarettes in their lips.
Five years ago such luxuries were not visible until
late in the evening.</p>

<p>She sat down on a velvet couch and took up the menu.
The same dishes. She was almost disappointed, but
why should she have been? It was all good of its
kind. She made her selection talking to the waiter
in French, at which his face lightened and he at once
interested himself in her choice. She leisurely went
through the meal and fell in at once with the new fashion
of a cigarette after it. She had not taken very many
whiffs before a man a couple of tables away who
<pb n="32"/>
had, unseen by her, been occasionally glancing at her,
rose, strode towards her table and sat down opposite.</p>

<p>He was a tall, loosely-built fellow, with an aggressive
swagger of the shoulders, yet with an air which seemed
to suggest that he was not unused to good society.
In his youth he had probably been good-looking, but
all that had survived at middle age was a certain devil-
may-care expression in his deepset dark eyes. His
square, resolute jaw indicated pugnacity and stubborn-
ness; his lips were puffy and the lower one moist and
of a disagreeable redness.</p>

<p>He learned his elbows upon the table and pushed
forward his head, his pugnacious chin more prominent
than ever. His bold, insolent eyes were fixed on her
face a few seconds before he spoke.</p>


<p><q>Vi Vaughan or her ghost, and, by Jove, handsomer
than ever.</q> His strident voice was as unpleasant as
his face. Violetta sat perfectly unmoved though
inwardly she felt as though she could have struck him.</p>

<p><q>I'm sorry I can't say the same of you, Gentleman
George--I presume you still answer to that name.</q></p>

<p><q>It's good enough I guess,</q> he retorted, with an
ugly glint in his eyes. <q>Anyhow, I feel honoured
to think you haven't forgotten it or myself either.</q></p>

<p><q>One doesn't easily bury disagreeable experiences.</q></p>

<p><q>The evil that men do, etcetera, etcetera. What?
Now my experience of you was of the most agreeable
kind, though I'm bound to say we were always at
loggerheads and we never once had the pleasure of
kissing away our differences.</q></p>

<p>Her answer was to call the waiter.</p>

<p><q>My bill, please,</q> said she, and coldly ignored the
man opposite.</p>

<p><q>You're not ratty, are you, Violetta? I didn't
mean anything.</q></p>

<p><q>It's a matter of indifference to me what you meant.
You'd better understand straight away, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Godfree,
that you and I are strangers. I shall take any attempt
<pb n="33"/>
to talk to me or to claim me as an acquaintance of yours
as an insult.</q></p>

<p>He laughed, but the laugh was not one of merriment.
It was obviously forced.</p>

<p><q>You can regard my talk in any way you choose,
but you can't get out of the plain fact that you <emph>are</emph>
an acquaintance and that you <emph>know</emph> it. I'm not likely
to forget the Beak Street Club's charming cantineer.</q></p>

<p>Violetta still ignored him. She was holding the
little slip of paper handed to her by the waiter and was
studying the contents. Then she opened her wrist bag,
drew out her purse and paid the bill, not forgetting a
liberal douceur. The waiter smilingly thanked her
in the politest French and she rose.</p>

<p><q>You're a fool to fall out with me,</q> snarled the man
in a grating voice. <q>I could have put you on to ever
so many good things. Dead certs at thundering long
odds.</q></p>

<p><q>I daresay. I'll do without your tips and yourself
as well.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> George Godfrey's eyes followed her to the door.
He was biting his nails and his distended lips were
uglier than ever.</p>

<p><q>She's changed. If ever there was a woman of
breeding Violetta looks like one now.</q></p>

<p>George Godfree was no mean judge. Though he
was now low down in the world and had been submerged
some years there was a time when he mixed with the
best. He had aristocratic connections but he had long
since tired their patience and exhausted their doles,
and he was looked upon as an irreclaimable <soCalled>bad
lot.</soCalled></p>

<p>He had always been <q>bitten</q> to use his own word,
by Violetta. To him she was as a dash of tarragon
vinegar is to a salad. She gave a new spice to life--
certainly to <emph>his</emph> life. He had missed her, and to see
her again so unexpectedly and so transformed had
revived his old feelings. Violetta's studied contempt
<pb n="34"/>
had angered him intensely, but its chief effect was to
fan the fire of his passion.</p>

<p><q>Where the deuce has she got her style from?</q>
he muttered. <q>She hadn't it in the old days when
she acted as the Hebe of that queer show of her father's.
Rum devil, old Vaughan. Not a bad sort. Always right
for a meal on the nod provided you hadn't rubbed him
the wrong way, and then he was as hard as nails. Guess
Violetta takes after him there. I wonder what her
game here is and what she's been doing? Anyhow, she
must have tumbled on her feet. There wasn't a better
dressed woman in the room, much less one who knows
how to wear her toggery so well.</q></p>

<p>This judgment was well founded. Violetta had
brought with her a good stock of Paris fashions and she
had acquired the air of distinction and individuality
which makes the French woman noticeable, no matter
where she may be. Among English, Violetta was
always taken to be French, but the French themselves
rarely were deceived. Still, if not the rose, she was
extremely near it.</p>

<p>Godfree swaggered back to his friends and accepted
their chaff with equanimity. His evasive replies con-
veyed the impression that he knew Violetta well, but
he would not give her away. Among the group of raffish
horsey men were two or three who had been members
of Captain Vaughan's Club, but they had not recognised
her, and he did not intend that they should.</p>

<p><q>Your swell chicken didn't seem to make good with
you,</q> remarked one man in a Yankee twang that one
could cut with a knife.</p>

<p><q>That was because she saw I came from your table,
old bean.</q></p>

<p>A laugh at the American's expense followed Godfree's
retort, and the talk drifted into the prospects of the
flat racing season.</p>

<p>Before he left the caf&#xe9; Godfree took the opportunity
to question the waiter who had served Violetta as to
<pb n="35"/>
what he knew about the lady but he could get no
information. Nevertheless, he made up his mind he
would <q>ferret</q> her out.</p>

<div n="4" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter IV</head>
<head type="main">On the <abbr>A.P.</abbr> Course</head>

<p>It took Violetta quite a day to get over the unlucky
encounter at the Caf&#xe9; Nice. <soCalled>Gentleman George</soCalled>
was about the last man she wanted to see. She disliked
the man in the old days, she positively hated him now.
She remembered him as one of the most objectionable
of the crowd known as <soCalled>The Boys.</soCalled> His manner was
presumptuous and he had a tendency to patronise her
which always roused her wrath. She had snubbed
him as she had never snubbed the rest who were vulgar
and were rude because they were ignorant. But George
Godfree knew better or ought to have known better.</p>

<p>She was intensely angry with herself that she had
yielded to an impulse to go to the Caf&#xe9; Nice just because
she had known it. She might just as well have selected
another.</p>

<p>The episode of Gentleman George had upset her more
than she would have thought possible. She wanted to
forget her father's club, its <choice><corr>habitu√©es</corr><orig>habituees</orig></choice> and all that
belonged to it, yet her very first day in London had
brought it all back as though it were but yesterday!</p>

<p>But had Violetta thought for a moment she must have
realised that her recollections of the turf would be revived
if she were to carry out the plans which were floating
in her mind. Though fortunes had been lost at horse
racing, fortunes had, on the other hand, been won.
It was the cool, level-headed bookmaker who was most
successful, She did not suppose she would ever earn
<pb n="36"/>
the title of a lady <soCalled>leviathan</soCalled> of the turf, but there
was something very fascinating in the idea. Anyhow,
whatever might be the outcome of her efforts, capital
must be the starting point. She had some &#xa3;200. It
might be increased if she were lucky.</p>

<p>That was the crux of the whole matter--luck.
Judgment, experience, could do much, but after all
the winning of a race depended upon a score of little
things impossible to be foreseen. <soCalled>Dead certs</soCalled>
had times out of number proved illusory. <soCalled>Dark
horses</soCalled> had always had a chance in the gamble, and
anybody who went in for betting must be prepared
to take a risk. Calculations and <soCalled>systems</soCalled> were not
to be depended upon. Even skilful <soCalled>hedging</soCalled> some-
times broke down.</p>

<p>Violetta had seen so much of the vicissitudes of
racing that she had come to regard luck as the most
potent factor. And this opinion had been backed
up by her experience at Monte Carlo and by her ventures
when she was the <soCalled>cantineer</soCalled> of her father's sporting
club. But she had never had a free hand. Her father
disliked her backing horses and as for making a <soCalled>book</soCalled>
he would not hear of it.</p>

<p>The question of luck closely concerned her. She
often wondered whether there was a mystic influence
behind which determined its goodness or badness as
applied to the person affected. Her strange power
at Monte Carlo puzzled her as much as it impressed
those who witnessed it. If she could be so successful
as mascotte at <foreign xml:lang="fr">rouge et noir</foreign>, why not at racing? She
did not think it would work out the same way, for the
reason she had given the man who had halved his
winnings with her, but as she had never tested the thing
who could say?</p>

<p><q>It's all nonsense,</q> she at last exclaimed impatiently.
<q>I'd better come down from the clouds and fix myself
on something practical.</q></p>

<p>Violetta had arrived in London on the Saturday
<pb n="37"/>
after Good Friday, too late to think about the Kempton
Park Spring meeting, which on Easter Monday opened
the racing season. The next fixture was Alexandra
Park, four days later. She was rather inclined towards
the minor races. There was less chance of horses being
scratched.</p>

<p>As she sauntered from Piccadilly Circus to Arundel
Street, where her hotel was, she purchased all the sporting
papers she was able to procure, and even invested a
few shillings in the <soCalled>special</soCalled> tips sent out by the
<soCalled>prophets.</soCalled> It wasn't that she believed in the prophets
but she liked to compare the various selections. Then
she retired to her bedroom and studied the list of entries
and the predictions.</p>

<p><q>I hardly know one of the horses,</q> she muttered.
<q>I haven't followed English racing since poor dad's
death. I guess I'll have to go to school again.</q></p>

<p>But the names of some of the jockeys and of the
owners were familiar, and so also were the pedigrees
of a few of the horses, and she turned to the latest
bettings. Prince Edward, the favourite, was evidently
looked upon as a safe winner, the odds, 3 to 2, were
so short. The majority of the prophets gave <q>Prince
Edward,</q> and she found that he had advanced rapidly
in favour, as in a trial with a stable companion, supposed
to be a faster animal, he had beaten the latter by a
couple of lengths. But at 3 to 2, he was not worth
backing.</p>

<p>Nor was the second favourite <q>Marcus</q> a much better
spec. Of the outsiders she rather fancied <q>Daughter
of the Mist</q> chiefly because the filly was one of the
progeny of the famous <q>Stockwell.</q> But only one
of the papers mentioned her. She was quite ignored
by all the professional tipsters. Another horse, <q>Bel-
phegor,</q> was spoken well of if he could be depended
upon, but he had the reputation of being most uncertain
in his temper. The odds on <q>Daughter of the Mist</q>
were quoted at 30 to 1, and <q>Belphegor</q> at 10 to 1.</p>

<pb n="38"/>
<p>Violetta determined not to make a leap in the dark
but to wait until she was on the course and had the
opportunity of seeing the animals, and she consumed
her soul in patience until the day of the fixture.</p>

<p>A thunderstorm--an unusual thing at Easter time--
broke over London the morning of the race day. This,
with the clayey, heavy soil of the <abbr>A. P.</abbr> course would
make the running a little difficult. It was on the cards
that a slow horse, if a stayer, would have a good chance.</p>

<p><q>I was right in waiting till I saw the horses,</q> thought
Violetta.</p>

<p>She mingled with the crowd that hurried from the
train, and plodded through the yellow mud churned
up to the consistency of thick cream to the entrance.
Outside was the usual gathering of peripatetic vendors
of refreshments. Small <soCalled>bookies,</soCalled> itinerant tipsters,
touts and what not gathered round the stewed eel stalls
and swallowed the steaming dainty with great gusto.
The fondness of horsey men for stewed eels has yet to
be explained. There is always a big demand outside
Aldridges on the occasion of a horse sale, and the con-
sumers are just as avid for the delicacy as they are on a
race day. Maybe it gives a greater relish to the beer
which follows--when it can be got. Jellied eels, Violetta
noticed, on this particular morning were slow of sale,
and cold fried fish an absolute drug in the market.
Possibly the keen air of the Northern Heights following
the storm made the hot fish stew more comforting.</p>

<p>Violetta paid the entrance money and passed through
the turnstile. The mud of the road leading to the course
was worse than that of the public thoroughfares. It
was glutinous in some parts, slushy in others, but no
one cared. The string of motor cars was never ending,
and did their best to distribute the yellow sticky mix-
ture over the foot passengers. In these days of short
skirts the women were much better off than in Victorian
times, and Violetta trudged along not much the worse
save for the mud on her boots and gaiters.</p>

<pb n="39"/>
<p>A man came up to her selling racing cards. She
bought one and glanced at the vendor. He was a red-
nosed, watery-eyed, loose lipped individual of middle
age, shabbily dressed but with something about his
manner which did not suggest the ordinary turf
hanger-on.</p>

<p><q>Isn't your name Alf Bartlett? It was <q>Doctor</q>
some four years ago, if I remember rightly,</q> said
Violetta.</p>

<p><q>Alf Bartlett it is. Not much of the <q>Doctor</q>
about me left, I reckon. I seem to know <emph>you</emph>.</q> He
stared at her fixedly. <q>By the lord! Miss Vaughan!</q>
he exclaimed. <q>And you're not too proud to speak
to me?</q></p>

<p><q>Why should I be?</q></p>

<p><q>Because I'm right down on the bedrock. You can
see it for yourself.</q></p>

<p>Violetta remembered Alf Bartlett as one of the smart-
est of the club members. He had been educated for a
doctor, had walked the hospitals, gained his diploma,
but had never practised. Coming into some money
had been his ruin. He had taken to betting, and when
he had run through his little fortune, he took to drinking.</p>

<p><q>I'm sorry,</q> said she. <q>Why don't you try to pull
yourself round? You're not old, you know.</q></p>

<p><q>Too old to alter. May I hope that things have gone
well with you? You look as if they had.</q></p>

<p><q>As well as I deserve, I suppose. Anyhow, well
enough for <emph>this</emph>--if it's any good to you.</q></p>

<p>She had drawn out a ten shilling note and pressed
it upon him.</p>

<p><q>I don't like taking it,</q> said he brokenly. <q>I guess
it'll go where the rest went.</q></p>

<p><q>I hope you won't be such a fool. Better put it on
a horse than down your throat.</q></p>

<p>The man's dull bleary eyes flashed momentarily.</p>

<p><q>You're right, Miss Vaughan. You used to be a
witch at spotting a winner. Do you know anything?</q></p>

<pb n="40"/>
<p><q>No. I'm an outsider just for the moment. I rather
fancy <q>Daughter of the Mist</q> for the Welter Handicap,
but I've nothing on.</q></p>

<p><q>None of the tipsters give her as any class.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, it's only a sporting chance. At 30 to 1 there's
not much one need risk. The running'll be heavy after
the rain. That's against her.</q></p>

<p><q>So it is, but the course is short, only five furlongs.
If she gets in front at the start and can hold on to the
last, she may cover the short course before the heavy
horses catch her. I wouldn't say what might happen
if she had to go the long course--a mile and one hundred
and fifty yards. What makes you fancy her?</q></p>

<p><q>She's one of the <q>Stockwell</q> blood, that's all.</q></p>

<p><q>H'm. I thought perhaps it might have been be-
cause she's in a way your namesake.</q></p>

<p><q>What do you mean?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, we used to call you the <q>Cantineer</q> in the
old Beak Street Club days, didn't we? It so happens
that <q>Daughter of the Mist</q> was first known as <q>Can-
tineer.</q> She won a selling race and the man who bought
her changed her name.</q></p>

<p><q>Who owned her originally?</q></p>

<p><q>Sir John Norman, but she was run by a nominee,
George Godfree. Maybe you remember him at the
club.</q></p>

<p>What a small world it suddenly seemed! Fate was
apparently destined to run her up against Godfree.
She wondered if this proximity would end here. But
what about Sir John Norman? Was he also destined
to play a part in her life?</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> said she, <q>I recollect <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Godfree very well.
What had he to do with Sir John Norman?</q></p>

<p><q>They were close pals for a time. Sir John didn't
get any good out of Gentleman George, you may bet
your life. He ought to have bought in Cantineer,
but I'm told Godfree talked him out of it. Had his
own game to play, I'll swear.</q></p>

<pb n="41"/>
<p><q>Who bought <q>Cantineer</q>?</q></p>

<p><q>A chap who knows a good horse when he sees one
--Dan Westoby. Of course, I don't know for certain,
but it's my impression Westoby made it all right with
Godfree for <choice><corr>persuading</corr><orig>persuding</orig></choice> Sir John to sell the filly.</q></p>

<p><q>How is it she's at such long odds to-day?</q></p>

<p><q>The deuce only knows. It's got whispered about
there's something wrong about her. All I can say is I
managed to get sight of her at a trial about three weeks
ago and she seemed to me as right as rain. It's a funny
thing as she should have gone back in the betting ever
since.</q></p>

<p>Violetta turned the matter over in her mind. Alf
Bartlett had no object in deceiving her and she knew
that he had the whole gamut of racing dodges at his
finger ends.</p>

<p><q>Look here, doctor. I'll have a look at <q>Daughter
of the Mist,</q> but in any case I shall put a bit on her. I
believe I'm a little superstitious. There might be some-
thing lucky in her name <q>Cantineer.</q></q></p>

<p><q>Then hanged if I don't follow your lead, Miss
Vaughan. It's your ten bob, you know. You were
always lucky for other people. I'd better get on before
I alter my mind. If I lose the lot I shan't be worse off
than I was. And if I win--well, with fifteen quid in
my pocket I shall feel like a millionaire. Same time, if
I was to follow my own judgment, I'd have a bit on
<q>Belphegor</q> in spite of his beast of a temper. Anyhow,
thank you heartily.</q></p>

<p><q>I hope it'll come off, and if it does, don't make a fool
of yourself.</q></p>

<p>The man put out a somewhat grimy hand, and Vio-
letta, blinding herself to its dirt, grasped it. Then the
<soCalled>Doctor</soCalled> rushed off to invest his ten shillings and
Violetta continued on her way towards the enclosure.</p>

<p>The crowd outside the ropes was not particularly
attractive. Not many had come for the love of sport
or of horses. All that was in their minds was money
<pb n="42"/>
making. A good many were of the same type, with
narrow, pallid faces, long noses, eyes devoid of expression
save for a certain restless expectancy, wide thin-lipped
mouths. In an odd way they were strangely suggestive
of horses. Some were itinerant bookies, and in these
cases their eyes were never for a moment still. They
came, most of them armed with portable stands on which
they placed placards with the names of the horses and
their respective odds. These men bawled one against
the other, but beyond this there did not seem any out-
ward show of rivalry.</p>

<p>The <soCalled>prophets</soCalled> were of a different class. They set
out to be absolutely certain of everything they asserted,
but with a cunning dash of cautiousness thrown in which
made their assurance more impressive. The main point,
however, was to get together as large a crowd as possible
to listen to their patter. One of these gentlemen started
by spreading his overcoat on the grass. Then he pro-
duced with a great flourish a bundle of what purported
to be five pound notes. After this came a score of
golden sovereigns--at least they looked like sovereigns
--and the money was solemnly counted and deposited
on the overcoat.</p>

<p>It wasn't quite clear what this performance had to
do with prophecy, but somehow it conveyed the notion
that the prophet was no hard-up catchpenny adven-
turer, but was a man of substance, able to pay for
<soCalled>correct</soCalled> information and therefore likely to be <soCalled>in
the know.</soCalled> The sight of the money and especially the
jingle of the sovereigns, whetted curiosity, and never
failed to make the hurrying public pause and listen.</p>

<p>The aim of the prophet was to appear perfectly fair
and impartial. He hadn't a word to say against the
favourite. <q>Prince Edward</q> was a good horse, there
wasn't a doubt about it, but and here the prophet
became very serious in tone and manner--<q>you've got
to be vurry, vurry careful. I don't say <q>Prince Ed-
ward</q> won't win, but there <emph>is</emph> a horse that'll give him
<pb n="43"/>
some trouble. <emph>I</emph> know what the stable thinks about
him and <emph>I</emph> know what he's done in his trial spins. You
do as you like, but if you want a pretty safe <abbr>spec.</abbr> at
long odds, you'll----</q> At this point the patter became
rather hazy, the only definite declaration being that you
had but to put down half-a-crown and you would get a
slip giving you the name of this dark and mysterious
prodigy.</p>

<p>Violetta was highly interested in the man's gab. She
knew quite well that anyone with sufficient assurance
could pose as a <soCalled>prophet.</soCalled> Stable <soCalled>information</soCalled>
was as likely to be wrong as right. Whatever a horse
might accomplish beforehand, no one could say what he
would do on the day of the race. To her it was amazing
how many of the crowd threw down their half-crowns
and walked away hugging the little piece of paper to
plank their money on the <soCalled>prophet's</soCalled> tip.</p>

<p>She did not waste time listening to any of the other
tipsters, and hurried towards the enclosure, paid the
admission money, and mingled among the groups of
<soCalled>bookies</soCalled> and backers. She wondered if among the
former there were any of the old <soCalled>crowd.</soCalled></p>

<p>She felt a slight tap on her shoulder. She turned. A
stout farmer-like man, with a smile broadening his
cheery face was beaming at her.</p>

<p><q>Blest if the sight o' you, lass, bean't good for sore
eyes. Leastways if I haven't made a mistake, an' I
don't think I have--it bean't often as I forget a face,
'specially if it be a woman's, though, to be sure, you
gals have a way o' growing up out o' knowledge. I'll
<pb n="44"/>
bet any money as your name's Vaughan--little Violetta
Vaughan.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, and I think I recollect you. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Burrup,
isn't it?</q></p>

<p><q>Aye, Ben Burrup's my name an' Yorkshire my
dwelling place. Why, it must be a matter o' four years
since you was ladling out whiskies an' sodas. I see the
death of your poor dad in the <title>Sporting Gazette</title>, an' it give
me a bit of a shock. We were great pals, him an' me.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I remember. Poor father. I missed him
awfully.</q></p>

<p><q>I'll bet you did. I hope as he left you a bit o'
brass.</q></p>

<p><q>Only his debts. The horse he was riding was so
knocked about the poor thing had to be shot.</q></p>

<p><q>That was a bit o' bad luck. If it's not a rude ques-
tion, what are you doing here? Not by yourself, eh?</q></p>

<p>Violetta understood the roguish look in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Burrup's
twinkling eyes. She laughed.</p>

<p><q>Yes, I am. Why not?</q></p>

<p><q>Then all I've got to say is I don't understand what
the Lunnon chaps be about. At Leeds you'd have a
whole string of 'em after you.</q></p>

<p><q>Then I'm glad I'm not at Leeds. I don't want
them, thank you. But, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Burrup, tell me--are you
still in the pencilling line?</q></p>

<p><q>What on earth should I be doing at the <abbr>A.P.</abbr> spring
meeting if I wasn't?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm glad, because I've got a fancy I'd like to back.</q></p>

<p>The bookmaker's smile fled.</p>

<p><q>Don't you, Miss Violetta. I wouldn't-like to know
I was walking away with your money in my pocket.</q></p>

<p><q>What nonsense. How do you know you will?
Anyhow, if I lose it'll only be the fortune of the race-
course. What's <q>Daughter of the Mist</q>?</q></p>

<p><q>Went a bit back this morning--35 to 1.</q></p>

<p><q>I wonder why. I'm told the filly ran well last
year.</q></p>

<pb n="45"/>
<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Burrup gave a short laugh.</p>

<p><q>It bean't no business o' mine to talk about the
'osses. I hears all and says nothing. It's only the odds
that int'rest me. But you're an old friend--well, she's
run by one o' the smartest o' the smart, Dan Westoby,
and he's got a tricky crowd in his pay. But mum's the
word. D'ye twig?</q></p>

<p>Violetta nodded.</p>

<p><q>Same time, mind ye, the going'll be pretty heavy
over this sticky, slippery turf. That's all agen her.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, I want to see her, and if she shapes well I'll
risk &#xa3;50 at 35 to 1. Will you take me?</q></p>

<p><q>That'll mean &#xa3;1,750 if I lose. Pretty heavy, my
dear,</q> and Ben Burrup gave a long whistle.</p>

<p><q>Well, will any of your friends do it?</q></p>

<p><q>I'll take you up to &#xa3;10. Maybe Bill Jackson's
good for another tenner. Shall I book your ten?</q></p>

<p><q>Wait till I've seen the filly. I suppose the horses
will come out before the race. You know the ropes
pretty well, I guess. Take me to a seat in the Grand
Stand where there's a fair view of the course.</q></p>

<p><q>Right y'are. We shall see some of my pals there.</q></p>

<p>They walked to the entrance of the Grand Stand,
Burrup nodding to and cracking jokes with his many
acquaintances as he went. He secured Violetta an
excellent seat. She surveyed the course through her
race glasses and noted its bend about half-way round,
and the long straight home. It seemed to her that all
things being equal it was a case of skilful jockeying.</p>

<p><q>I'll sound some of the boys about <q>Daughter of the
Mist,</q></q> said Burrup. <q>Meanwhile you make yourself
happy. The horses'll be out in two ticks.</q></p>

<p>All traces of the morning's storm were gone. The
sky was of an intense blue, with here and there a scudding
fleecy cloud. The April sun was shining brilliantly
as only an English April sun can. The air was exhilar-
ating and under its influence, combined with the ex-
citement of the coming contest and the strong personal
<pb n="46"/>
interest she felt in it, brought a clear rich crimson to
her cheeks.</p>

<p>Violetta was about to put the glasses down when she
chanced to swerve, and the movement brought the
other end of the Grand Stand into view. She saw a
man with his glasses turned in her direction. She knew
him at once. It was George Godfree. The woman by
his side, tall, fair and somewhat overdressed, was talking
to him animatedly. He did not appear to be listening
to her.</p>

<p>Violetta could not say why the sight of Godfree was
disquieting, as it was the most natural thing in the world
that he should be there, but it was so. However, she
dismissed the man from her mind, as at that moment
the horses entered the course for a preliminary canter
and to show themselves. Violetta at once picked out
<q>Daughter of the Mist.</q> Her jockey's colours were
blue and white. She was a beautiful creature--a dark
chestnut--perfectly symmetrical, yet strong and wiry.
She moved as if on wires working harmoniously. There
wasn't a sign of anything wrong with her.</p>

<p>Of the other horses, <q>Prince Edward,</q> the favourite,
won Violetta's approval, but he was a trifle too slightly
built, so she thought, to be a stayer. Another horse
took her fancy. He was a bright chestnut with a white
streak down his nose. Hardly handsome, he was big,
bony, and enormously strong. The question was did
his speed equal his strength? His jockey's colours were
scarlet and gold. She looked at the card--scarlet and
gold belonged to <q>Belphegor,</q> the horse of uncertain
temper, mentioned by Alf Bartlett.</p>

<p>The horses came out in a cluster and then separated
with the exception of three. One of the latter was
<q>Belphegor.</q> The three kept close together for about
twenty yards and then something happened to annoy
the bright chestnut and his haunches suddenly went
up, and he lashed out one of his hind legs in a vicious
kick which luckily touched nothing. The jockey prob-
<pb n="47"/>
ably was prepared for the horse's attempt at buck jump-
ing, as he stuck to his saddle gallantly. He brought
the whip down sharply on the animal's hindquarters,
and presently <q>Belphegor</q> condescended to use his
four legs normally. The knowing ones among the
spectators shook their heads. <q>Belphegor</q> was evi-
dently inclined to be in one of his tantrums.</p>

<p><q>Not much chance of your getting your money on
<q>Daughter of the Mist,</q></q> Violetta heard Burrup whisper
behind her. <q>The chaps fight shy of her. The best
I could do was to divide your ten pounds between me
and Bill Jackson.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Burrup, how horrid. She's lovely, don't
you think so?</q></p>

<p><q>It's not the filly, it's the crowd that's running her
we're afraid of. We know something of Dan Westoby,
George Godfree, and the rest, and we don't intend to be
rooked. I don't suppose half a dozen of the public have
backed her. You see, after winning the selling race and
coming into Westoby's hands, she did nothing but lose
everything she was entered for. It was thought that
Westoby was horribly unlucky, because in each case
the filly nearly pulled it off.</q></p>

<p><q>Who was the jockey?</q></p>

<p><q>Ted Loram.</q></p>

<p><q>And is he up to-day?</q></p>

<p><q>Of course he is.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh.</q></p>

<p><q>Eh? What do you know about him?</q></p>

<p><q>Nothing much, excepting that I believe he's a
bad egg.</q></p>

<p><q>That wouldn't surprise me. It be mighty queer
that the backing should only be among the Westoby
gang. If Loram doesn't win they don't stand to lose
much. But I fancy they're fly and are cocksure they've
got a good thing. Jackson tells me that ten minutes
ago Godfree wanted to put a bit more on, but Bill wasn't
taking any and George went off with a face as black as
<pb n="48"/>
my hat. Hallo--there's the bell. 'Xcuse me, miss.</q></p>

<p>And the bookmaker hurried off leaving Violetta with
much to ponder over. Amid her disturbing thoughts
one thing was tolerably clear. The Westoby gang, as
Burrup called it, had clearly engineered the business,
with the assistance of Loram, and to-day the coup was
to be brought off. She did not feel at all comfortable
at benefiting by a fraud.</p>

<p><q>All the same I don't see that I'm to blame if <q>Daugh-
ter of the Mist</q> shows her true form and beats the rest,</q>
she thought.</p>

<p>The annoying part was that in a way she was asso-
ciated with George Godfree, and she hoped devoutly
it would not get to his ears that she had backed the filly.
But she had not time to consider further the position.
The horses were being marshalled for the start and were
coming into line.</p>

<p>Considerable restiveness was caused by Belphegor's
bad conduct. Violetta put down the big chestnut as an
irreclaimable beast. He was clearly bent on mischief,
and it was only after several false starts that the official
got them away in something like equality.</p>

<p>At first it was a scramble. <q>Belphegor</q> was showing
temper, and the jockeys round about him were doing
their best to keep away from the brute. But the
creature took it into his head to <q>hug</q> his horses, and
his rider could not get him clear despite whip and spur.
It was unlucky that the favourite was his nearest neigh-
bour, for his jockey found himself considerably ham-
pered. About a quarter of the course had been covered
and then one of the horses found an opening, shook itself
free, and in a flash was a length in front. The jockey's
colours were blue and white.</p>

<p>People stared and looked at their cards. Blue and
white stood opposite No. 6, and the name of the horse
was <q>Daughter of the Mist.</q> No one looked pleased.
Quite the reverse. She was run in the name of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jones,
about whom nothing was known. As for the filly her-
<pb n="49"/>
self, had anybody troubled to look up her record for
the past year it would not have been found sufficiently
encouraging to warrant one venturing a shilling upon her
chances. No wonder she had been left severely alone.</p>

<p>Violetta's colour fled and returned. She was breath-
less with excess of emotion. The hand holding the
race-glass to her eves quivered. The excitement of the
gaming table was nothing to this. Rouge et noir and
roulette were lifeless and sordid. One's thoughts in
watching the spinning ball were sordid. There was no
struggle of flesh and blood. To watch a number of
high-bred sensitive animals straining every nerve and
muscle in rivalry was a different matter altogether.</p>

<p>The filly was doing splendidly. She was being kept
close to the rails and was quite half a dozen lengths ahead.
Unless she was overhauled she would be able to sweep
round the bend--one of the features of the <abbr>A. P.</abbr> course
--without the slightest chance of losing her advantageous
position.</p>

<p><q>Oh you dear--oh you darling!</q> murmured Violetta.</p>

<p>The words had hardly escaped her lips than some-
thing totally unexpected happened, and a roar burst
from the crowd. A jockey in scarlet and gold was
sprawling on the ground. Belphegor had thrown his
rider. The latter was apparently unhurt. In less than
a second he was on his feet, and had dashed to his horse
which with strange perversity was standing stock still,
seemingly surveying his work.</p>

<p>The jockey sprang into the saddle, and <q>Belphegor</q>
seized with a new mood, no sooner felt the weight on
his back, than he plunged forward and raced after the
other horses at an amazing speed. The jockey had
the sense to leave him alone and probably this was what
the horse wanted. Shouts were heard all over the
course as stride by stride he gained upon the striving
horses in front, and about halfway round the bend he
was in front and close to the rails. But <q>Daughter of
the Mist</q> was still half a dozen lengths ahead, and
<pb n="50"/>
apparently the heavy ground had not yet affected her.
But when the two emerged into the straight run home,
it was seen that <q>Belphegor</q> was only behind by a
length, and was moving with tremendous power and
freshness. The odds on him had dropped to 6 to 1, and
many who had backed the favourite tried to <q>hedge,</q>
for <q>Prince Edward</q> was hopelessly beaten. In the
short space of a quarter of a minute everything changed
for <q>Daughter of the Mist</q> was visibly tiring, and
<q>Belphegor</q> was getting nearer at every stride and
was as strong as ever.</p>

<p>Violetta could hardly control her agitation. Money
had little to do with it, for if <q>Belphegor</q> won, her
actual loss out of pocket would be small, but the fever
of speculation had seized her, and to be defeated would
be galling. As the horses neared the post, <q>Belphegor,</q>
with his muzzle on a level with the filly's haunches,
Violetta closed her eyes. There was not more than
twenty yards to run, and it was purely a question
whether <q>Daughter of the Mist</q> would last. Violetta
could not look. All the blood in her body seemed to be
rushing to her brain.</p>

<p>Then a tremendous cheering was heard and a man
near her ejaculated <q>Great Scott, did you ever see
anything like the way that horse <q>Belphegor</q> forged
ahead? Another half a dozen yards and he'd have
romped in.</q></p>

<p>So <q>Daughter of the Mist</q> had won, but Violetta
could not trust herself to believe it until she saw
<q><abbr>No.</abbr> 6</q> hoisted on the board. Her friend Burrup
presently came to her looking a little rueful, but he
warmly congratulated her nevertheless.</p>

<p><q>Are you going to follow your luck with the next
race, Miss Violetta? I'm a bit afraid of you, you know;
still, if you've another good thing up your sleeve, I'll
see what I can do.</q></p>

<p><q>No. I've finished for to-day. It was all luck,
you see, and a very near thing. Who would have thought
<pb n="51"/>
it was possible?--I mean about that cantankerous
<q>Belphegor.</q> I'd like to see him run again. He was
badly ridden. His jockey used the whip and lost his
temper in addition.</q></p>

<p><q>You're right there, Miss Vaughan. By Jove, if
his mount had been someone who understood him, he'd
have chawed up the rest of the field. You should ha'
seen Westoby's face when his filly was losing ground
every yard. It was a sight, I can tell you. As long as
a fiddle. As for Godfree, danged if he didn't go green.
They must ha' netted a nice little pile. They won't
do the same trick again, I'll bet.</q></p>

<p>Then he and Violetta had a little talk about the
settlement of her bets with him and Jackson, and Vio-
letta went back to town alternately exalted and depressed.
She was worried about her strange piece of luck. Was
it really to be explained by the fact that she had Norman
in her mind when she backed the horse which had once
been Norman's? She had rarely won when she only
thought of herself. But what was the use of trying to
penetrate the unknown?</p>

</div>



<div n="6" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter VI</head>
<head type="main"><q>I've No Horses to Show You Now</q></head>

<p>Two days later Violetta was at Paddington on her way
to Maidenhead. She had written to Ella to say she was
coming and had a reply sufficiently cordial to warrant
her expecting a warm welcome.</p>

<p>However, she was now on her way to a different world
--a world, which if it were placid and monotonous, was
at least refined, and her mercurial temperament revived
at the thought. And she was in addition really anxious
to hear the story of Sir John Norman's misfortunes.</p>

<p>She easily found her way to The Willows. It was
<pb n="52"/>
a double-fronted house with a verandah and a wisteria
half covering the windows and reaching to the roof. It
had a spacious garden in front with stabling at the side.
Very cosy and comfortable, but suburban--quite a
contrast to Normanhurst, the stately white stone mansion
built in the florid Italian style with its pilasters, its
Parthenon-like front, its long balconied windows, its
imposing projecting porch, its terrace and spacious
lawn and shrubberies.</p>

<p>A neatly dressed maid opened the door to Violetta
and ushered her into a pretty room with French windows
opening into a fairly large garden, at the end of which
was the river. Comfortable, like the rest of the house,
but again a complete contrast to the oak-panelled
morning room at Normanhurst.</p>

<p>She had not long to wait. Ella burst in upon her
with that hurried, almost rushing manner, which Vio-
letta remembered so well.</p>

<p><q>My dear Vi, how glad I am to see you. How awfully
sweet of you to come!</q> she cried in a high-pitched
voice.</p>

<p>Violetta found herself being kissed effusively, then
held at arms' length, and being kissed again.</p>

<p>Ella Norman had always been a gusher, and she
seemed to Violetta to be more gushing than ever. At
seventeen it could be put up with, but at twenty-two
it was slightly over-powering. In addition, she had a
way of swarming over one, which Violetta had always
found rather irritating. Just now it was particularly
so. She was half a head taller than her visitor, slim
and undulating, and her long arms, after being stretched
out after the fashion of the angel on the preposterous
Guards' Memorial in Waterloo Place, enfolded Violetta
in a kind of bear's hug. Despite this overwhelming
affection Violetta was quite conscious that her appear-
ance and her dress were being closely scrutinised.</p>

<p>Then the two looked at each other appraisingly, as
women do who have not seen each other for a long time.
<pb n="53"/>
Violetta knew by the faint shade of disappointment
which crept over Ella's face, that she expected to find
the wanderer had <soCalled>gone off,</soCalled> and that the contrary
had happened. As for Ella, she had decidedly deterior-
ated. The dark half-circles beneath the eyes and the
pinched-in sallow cheeks, showed that she was inclined
to be neurotic.</p>

<p><choice><corr>Violetta</corr><orig>Viloetta</orig></choice> was sorry but not surprised. If only half
the misfortunes hinted at in Ella's letter had taken place,
the experience was enough to leave traces behind. But
she asked no questions, she knew the story would come.
Ella was not one to keep her woes to herself.</p>

<p><q>Come and see your room, dear,</q> was Ella's remark
after the look of inspection. <q>I want you to stay a
long, long time with me.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, but I've not come prepared to do that. I've
brought nothing with me.</q></p>

<p><q>That doesn't matter. You can easily wire in-
structions to have your luggage sent on. Meanwhile,
with my help you can make shift. It isn't boating
weather yet, so you won't be asked to spoil that charm-
ing dress, as it certainly would be spoilt if John had the
handling of the punt. He hasn't got the hang of the
pole yet, and he splashes awfully.</q></p>

<p>It was characteristic of the baronet's sedateness and
incapacity that his sister always spoke of him as <q>John,</q>
never as <q>Jack.</q></p>

<p><q>He's on the river now,</q> went on Ella, as they as-
cended the staircase. <q>I persuaded him to come here.
The doctor said he was thoroughly run down and wanted
a complete change and plenty of open air exercise.
Boating seemed to me to be the best antidote to that
detestable racing, so when the collapse came and
ruin was in sight, I took this furnished house and brought
him here. He was really incapable of thinking for him-
self. Oh, my dear Violetta, I've heaps to tell you.
It's a wonder I'm not dead with worry. What's going
to happen I haven't the least idea. Of course, our
<pb n="54"/>
affairs are in the hands of the lawyers, and you know
what snails they are.</q></p>

<p>Talking incessantly and buzzing about Violetta,
hindering rather than helping her to disrobe herself,
Ella showed sufficiently the state of her nerves by her
passing from one subject to another without the slightest
connecting link, and by her spasmodic <q>oh dear, oh
dear,</q> which seemed to come from her more by force
of habit than from any emotional necessity.</p>

<p>At last they were seated quietly in the room with
the French windows. Ella ordered tea and plunged
without preface into a recital of her brother's disasters.</p>

<p><q>It's all come about through races and betting. I
assure you I never suspected anything of the kind. Of
course, John was always fond of horses, but I thought
his taste never went beyond hunters, and those cost him
no end of money, Heaven knows--one lump, or two,
dear? No sugar? Oh well, we can still afford <emph>that</emph>
luxury in spite of the price. What was I telling you?</q></p>

<p><q>About Sir John's love of hunting.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh yes. I used to be thankful that he had a hobby
as it kept his mind from dwelling on poor Alice. She,
I needn't say, was a constant drag upon him. He paid
the doctor who had charge of her &#xa3;750 a year, and then
there were continual extras. I know he looked forward
to a life-long infliction, and perhaps had he anticipated
she was so soon to pass away, he might not have been
so foolish. It's a terrible thing that the marriage laws
are so stupid. He ought to have been able to free
himself--I mean so far as the marriage tie was con-
cerned--but there it was. He was helpless. You see
the hunting season only lasts a few months, and what
was he to do the rest of the year? It never occurred to
me when he took to going to races that he had any
interest in anything beyond the animals.</q></p>

<p><q>Did you really imagine that?</q> asked Violetta
with a elevation of her dark eyebrows at the ends nearest
the nose, which always charmed the men.</p>

<pb n="55"/>
<p><q>Yes, why not? I've always heard that racing was
supported because it improved the breed of horses.</q></p>

<p><q>Rubbish. That's a part of our English self-decep-
tion. No one seriously believes it. Stop betting and
you stop races. Not that I see any harm in betting.</q></p>

<p><q>No harm! Violetta, it's horrible. You don't know.
You don't understand.</q></p>

<p>Violetta was inclined to laugh, but she kept her
countenance.</p>

<p><q>Haven't I told you it was betting which practically
ruined John? At the same time, he mightn't have been
so foolish but for a friend of his--a man who was with
him at Balliol. They hadn't seen each other for years
when unluckily they met accidentally at Newmarket.
I never could get much out of John how it was brought
about, but it's certain he came under the influence of
this man, who, though of good family, is, I'm sure, a
shocking blackguard. I saw him once, and once was
quite enough.</q></p>

<p><q>What was his name?</q> asked Violetta suddenly.</p>

<p><q>George Godfree. I believe he's entitled to call
himself <q>The Honourable,</q> and that's the only thing
about him that <emph>is</emph> honourable. He's connected with the
Fitzhaughton family. The Marquis of Fitzhaughton
was his uncle or brother-in-law. Some relation anyhow.
I never cared to enquire what, I hated the man too
much.</q></p>

<p>George Godfree! Gentleman George! For a moment
Violetta's heart sank. She felt almost terrified. It
was not that she was afraid of Godfree, but it was so
strange that the working of Fate should have thrown
Gentleman George in her way twice within forty-eight
hours. His connection with Norman's downfall was
certainly a serious matter. Soon she recovered her-
self sufficiently to ask:</p>

<p><q>Did your brother run any horses?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know. He never told me he did, but, of
course, he may have done so. You see, I was mostly in
<pb n="56"/>
town. I was very much occupied at the time with
various social movements. Christian Science was
greatly interesting me just then, and soon after I took
up the Religious Stage Society. Studying the old Mys-
tery Plays I found exceedingly absorbing, and really
I had no leisure for enquiring what John was doing.
Why should I? There was no need--at least, so I
thought. Of course, I knew nothing about his friend-
ship with Godfree--nor about Godfree either.</q></p>

<p>Violetta hardly heard what Ella was saying. She
didn't care a fig for Christian Science or for Mystery
Plays. George Godfree was in her thoughts. She was
wondering with what gang he was in league. Gentry
of his kind never worked by themselves. Their schemes
for swindling the unwary required more than one hand.
Gentleman George, with his insinuating society tone
and manner when it was necessary to use them, and his
real knowledge of society ways, was invaluable as a
decoy, but he had not the brains to originate a <foreign xml:lang="la">modus
operandi</foreign> or to carry one out.</p>

<p>Violetta was brought back to the subject by Ella
entering into a long and involved story how John had
got deeper and deeper into the mire and at last had to
sell Normanhurst.</p>

<p><q>I don't exactly understand how it came about,</q>
said she. <q>I never could grasp figures or law.</q></p>

<p><q>I should like to know,</q> said Violetta.</p>

<p><q>Well, I daresay John could tell you if you care to
ask.</q></p>

<p><q>But haven't <emph>you?</emph></q></p>

<p><q>Of course I have, but I couldn't make head or tail
of the affair. It seemed to me to be awfully compli-
cated. The only thing really definite was that when
all the debts were paid there remained enough to bring
in about &#xa3;1,000 a year, and we both have to live upon
it.</q></p>

<p><q>You may marry well. You hinted that you were
engaged,</q> put in Violetta.</p>

<pb n="57"/>
<p><q>Oh, well, nothing's settled. It can't be----</q> she
broke off suddenly.</p>

<p><q>There's John. Shall we go and meet him?</q> she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Violetta was only too glad. She found the con-
tinuous pouring out of sympathy to be a little trying.
The interruption was also acceptable for another reason.
Ella at any moment might dart off at a tangent and
enquire what she had been doing during the past four
years, and though Violetta was ready with a story she
was not at all anxious to tell it. The inventive tale
might break down under cross-examination. No doubt
at some time or another Ella would question her, but
the longer the ordeal was delayed the better.</p>

<p>The two passed into the garden. A head and shoulders
--the first surmounted by a boating cap, the second
swathed in a muffler--could be seen rising slowly above
the river bank. Soon the whole figure was visible--
tall and slim, resembling Ella's conformation of body,
but not so willowy.</p>

<p>Recalling her castle in the air at Monte Carlo when
she first learned that Lady Norman was dead, Violetta
regarded the man crossing the lawn, his walk half slouch-
ing, half springy, with no little curiosity. She remem-
bered perfectly well how he looked at Normanhurst,
and she wondered whether ill luck had affected him.
Of course, her aerial castle had toppled over at
Ella's story, but the ruins had still some interest for
her.</p>

<p>Norman suddenly straightened himself and raised
his cap. Violetta thought he was better looking than
when she last saw him. His dark hair, which came
rather low down on his forehead, showed streaks of
grey, but his drooping moustache was unchanged.
His expression was as refined as ever, but seemed to show
more decision. His eyes, like Ella's, somewhat dreamy,
were in keeping with the reputation he had among his
friends of being a poet. Violetta had forgotten this
<pb n="58"/>
side of his character, and it came back to her memory
with a sense of surprise.</p>

<p><q>You must forgive me, Miss Vaughan, for not being
here to welcome you,</q> said he. <q>Ella didn't appear
to know what time you were coming. Anyhow, I hope
she's looked after you properly.</q></p>

<p><q>You needn't have any doubt on that score, Sir
John. I am quite at home already.</q></p>

<p><q>There's not much to feel at home with. At any
rate, I've no horses now to show you,</q> said he.</p>

<p><q>I admire other things besides horses.</q></p>

<p><q>I doubt if you'll find many here, and what there is
isn't mine.</q></p>

<p><q>The river?</q></p>

<p><q>I share that in common with others. Are you
fond of boating?</q></p>

<p><q>I know nothing about it.</q></p>

<p><q>Then we'll go out to-morrow providing it's fine.
I'll give you a lesson if you like.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't try punting,</q> put in Ella. <q>It's all very
well in the summer when the trickling of cold water
down your arm isn't unpleasant; but in this weather--
ugh!</q></p>

<p><q>I didn't say punting. We'll have the double sculler.
You may steer us, Ella, if you'll promise to keep your
thoughts fixed on the rudder lines. You're not to be
trusted, you know.</q></p>

<p><q>You'd better wait until Violetta's luggage comes.
I'm not going to let her spoil her pretty frock. There's
no hurry, because I want Violetta to stay with us a long,
long time--that is, if her plans will allow her.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes--yes. You must stay,</q> urged Norman.</p>

<p><q>You're very kind, but I don't intend to inflict
myself upon you,</q> said Violetta, who did not fail to
note the sudden intensity of Sir John's gaze. <q>For a
few days I'm unsettled and if you don't mind putting
up with me while I'm looking out for a post of some
kind, I shall be very thankful.</q></p>

<pb n="59"/>
<p><q>There's plenty of time for that. After I've made
myself decent, I'll join you two. Seven o'clock I
suppose, as usual, Ella?</q></p>

<p>His sister nodded, and the baronet raising his cap
slowly, sauntered towards the house.</p>

<p><q>How do you think John looks?</q> enquired Ella
anxiously.</p>

<p><q>Better than I should have expected after what he's
gone through.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you really think so? I hope you're right. The
question that's worrying me is what is he going to do?
At his age he ought to get rid of his purposeless life and
have some occupation.</q></p>

<p><q>I suppose so, but one generally regards existence
according to one's temperament. Your brother always
seemed to be fairly busy one way or the other.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, but he had Normanhurst to look after. Now
that is gone he is like a derelict drifting anywhere, and
he may come into collision with something ugly and
awkward and be smashed entirely.</q></p>

<p><q>What do you mean by that?</q></p>

<p><q>My dear Violetta, don't you understand?</q> cried
Ella, impatiently. <q>In his present mood he's liable
to be imposed upon by any designing woman who takes
the trouble to capture him.</q></p>

<p><q>Such women are not usually ugly and awkward,</q>
remarked Violetta drily.</p>

<p><q>Well, we needn't go into details. I know very well
that during the last two years he must have mixed with
very queer society, both men and women, on the race-
course. He was bound to, you know--or perhaps you
don't know.</q></p>

<p><q>I'll take your word for it. But if occupation is to
be his protection against these dangers, why doesn't he
get some Government post?</q></p>

<p><q>I doubt if he's fitted for Government work. He's
frightfully unbusinesslike. Of course, I'm aware a man
needn't be clever to do all that's wanted in the War Office
<pb n="60"/>
or Foreign Office. If you turn up every morning like
a piece of clockwork, and are contented with filling up
forms and are not silly enough to suggest improvements
and are never in a hurry, I believe you get on all right.
Cleverness in a Government Department means the
knack of shifting responsibility on to another Depart-
ment, never knowing anything, holding your tongue,
and taking as many holidays as the chief will stand.
John's a good deal too conscientious for that sort of
thing; besides, he's too fond of airing his own opinion,
and as he's generally wrong, you see what a mess he'd
get into. No, there's only one thing I can see for him.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, and what's that?</q></p>

<p><q>Marriage, my dear. Marriage with a level-headed
rich woman who's above the frivolity of the tastes of
the present day and who takes life seriously.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh yes. A bishop's widow, for instance. It's a
pity so few of them are about.</q></p>

<p>Ella looked up sharply. Was her dear friend pulling
her leg?</p>

<p>But Violetta's face never moved a muscle.</p>

</div>



<div n="7" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter VII</head>
<head type="main"><q>I've Sworn to be Master of Normanhurst
Once More</q></head>

<p>The next day was wet. The river was out of the ques-
tion. There was quite sufficient dampness in the air
outside and inside the house to satisfy anybody with
aquatic tastes. Violetta hadn't the slightest inclination
for boating exercise, and secretly was pleased she had
escaped. Reclining languorously on the cushions of a
punt--preferably amber cushions, as the tint would
intensify the violet blue of the Irish eyes she had in-
<pb n="61"/>
herited from her mother--was a different matter. But
the picture demanded a scorching sun and the contrast
of the deep purple shadows of the overhanging trees
of Cliefden. Norman suggested billiards for the morn-
ing's amusement, and this was entirely to her fancy.</p>

<p><q>Then you won't want me,</q> put in Ella.</p>

<p><q>Thanks no, old girl. The last time you marked for
me and Percival you were perpetually giving him my
score as well as his own. That's the drawback of an
engaged girl, Miss Vaughan. She can think of nobody
but the man she's taken under her wing.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't be stupid, John,</q> returned his sister, half
annoyed and half pleased. <q>As for marking for you, I'm
only too glad to escape. The click of the balls is apt
to get on my nerves, and the talk peculiar to the game
bores me to death. Why don't you billiard players
find something more original to say than <q>hard lines,</q>
<q>just missed it, by Jove,</q> <q>sorry old man,</q> when you
pocket the other one's white ball, and so on?</q></p>

<p><q>You've left out the most important expression
<q>dammit.</q> I admit there's not much variation, but I
suppose no other words fit the situations so well. How
are you going to amuse yourself this morning?</q></p>

<p><q>I shall call on the Vicar. I'm awfully keen on
interesting him in our religious stage work. He's a bit
afraid of some of his congregation, but I'm in hopes of
talking him over. His mind at present's a perfect
blank on the subject. He knows nothing about the old
Mystery and Miracle Plays. We're going to revive one,
Violetta. You ought to be a member of our Society.
I believe you'd do one of the characters splendidly.</q></p>

<p><q>Please don't ask me. I'm sure I should be a frightful
duffer.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not so sure. You used to take part in the plays
at school that we used to get up on prize-giving days.</q></p>

<p><q>That's a different thing. I'm as ignorant as the
Vicar about religious plays.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, there's an excuse for you but not for him. He
<pb n="62"/>
didn't even know until I told him that the drama really
had its origin in the church, and he looked quite
horrified.</q></p>

<p><q>I should think so,</q> said her brother. <q>He was
afraid you'd be asking him to lend you his church for
a theatrical show.</q></p>

<p><q>I wish <emph>you'd</emph> take up the study, John. It would at
least give you an interesting subject to think about.</q></p>

<p><q>I hate what you call <soCalled>interesting</soCalled> subjects. They're
only called interesting because you don't know what
else to say about them. But go and convert the Vicar
by all means.</q></p>

<p>Ella went off in something like a huff, and Norman,
turning to Violetta, said lightly:</p>

<p><q>That's how my discussions with Ella always end.
When she finds herself cornered she takes to her heels.
She's sometimes impossible. If she were not for ever
formulating rules of conduct for my guidance, her im-
possibility wouldn't matter much, but unfortunately
I'm one of her hobbies. Do you know I had the greatest
difficulty in persuading her that a <choice><corr>billiard</corr><orig>bililard</orig></choice> room was
indispensable in any house she might select. How on
earth could I amuse myself indoors on a day like this
without one? I suppose she saw this, as she eventually
gave in. There are two or three decent boating men
who live in the neighbourhood, and they now and again
drop in. You play?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, a little, but after what you've told me I should
be ashamed to show my awkwardness before an expert.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm very far from being that. Occasionally I play
a decent game, at other times I'm simply out of it.
It all depends upon the mood I'm in, I suppose.</q></p>

<p><q>I hope you're in good form this morning.</q></p>

<p><q>I ought to be.</q></p>

<p>He smiled at her and his eyes twinkled. That look
on his face was new to Violetta. She could not remem-
ber anything like it when she was staying at Norman-
hurst. He struck her then as remote, unfriended,
<pb n="63"/>
melancholy, slow, especially the two last. Animation
certainly improved him. Perhaps the cloud of his
matrimonial trouble was the cause of his subdued aspect
in the old days. Or had she misread his character?
Whatever it was she was disposed to be more interested
in him than she had anticipated.</p>

<p><q>Of course you ought. I want to pick up a few
hints.</q></p>

<p><q>I'll do my best. One thing's in my favour--I
shan't have any bets on.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you bet on the game?</q></p>

<p><q>Generally. It puts a little spice into the play,
though I must confess it often spoils mine. Directly
I have the slightest responsibility I begin to feel nervous.
It's a beastly stupid weakness, but I've never been able
to conquer it. In fact----</q></p>

<p>He stopped abruptly. Violetta looked at him en-
quiringly, but he said no more.</p>

<p>The billiard room was built out from the house, and
the housekeeper--the only one of the old Normanhurst
servants who had been retained--knowing her master's
tastes, had had a fire lighted. The blaze was a sufficient
antidote to the drabness and damp of the outside, and
the room was really inviting with its crimson walls
adorned with sporting prints depicting <choice><corr>bygone</corr><orig>byegone</orig></choice>
champions of the racecourse.</p>

<p>Norman's eyes followed Violetta's as they glanced
at the pictures. Horses appealed to her irresistibly.</p>

<p><q>I'd half a mind to have these things removed when
I took the place,</q> said he, half <choice><corr>apologetically</corr><orig>apologetiaclly</orig></choice>.</p>

<p><q>Why?</q></p>

<p><q>They gave my conscience a twinge. But I've got
used to them now. I can see they interest you, so I'm
glad I let them remain.</q></p>

<p><q>Anything to do with horses I like.</q></p>

<p>She walked slowly round the room, reading the in-
scriptions recording the victories of <q>Voltigeur,</q> <q>The
Flying Dutchman,</q> <q>Blink Bonny,</q> <q>Donovan,</q>
<pb n="64"/>
<q>Eclipse,</q> <q>Pretty Polly,</q> <q>Ormonde,</q> and other
dead and gone celebrities, while Norman got out the
balls and spotted the red. He gave her the choice of the
white balls. She chose the plain, and she opened with
the usual miss in baulk.</p>

<p><q>You know something,</q> said he, laughingly. <q>Ella,
when she deigns to play, which isn't often, can never
manage the safety stroke. She goes for the red in-
variably and nearly always misses it and lets me in.</q></p>

<p>His reply should, of course, have been another miss
in baulk, but he went for the red and left her an easy
cannon. She guessed that he made the stroke out of
politeness, and she purposely mis-cued, and her ball
rolled into a pocket without hitting either the red or
the white.</p>

<p><q>Better luck next time,</q> was Norman's comment.</p>

<p>The red was over the middle pocket and he could not
very well avoid scoring without obviously betraying
his desire to see her win. The game went on. Do
what he would, Norman always found himself a little
ahead. Violetta made no break of any account, but
what puzzled her antagonist was that when she went
for a particularly difficult stroke she always brought it
off. On the other hand, she missed some ridiculously
easy ones. The game ended in Norman's favour in
spite of his intention to lose.</p>

<p><q>I don't understand your play,</q> said he. <q>You
made some amazing shots. I never thought you'd go
for them. But you had bad luck. The game ought to
have been yours anyway.</q></p>

<p><q>I suppose so. You did your best to help me, you
know.</q></p>

<p>He flushed slightly. His little ruse to please her had
failed. The tone of her voice as well as her words
told him that.</p>

<p><q>I confess it. The plain truth is I underrated your
skill and benefited by what you call your bad luck. I
wanted you to win, but I don't believe you tried.</q></p>

<pb n="65"/>
<p><q>That's my impression about you, Sir John--unless
you were in one of your moods.</q></p>

<p><q>Honestly, I played up as though I was in form.
But come now, did either of us go straight? You've
seen what I can't do. I saw lots of chances you'd have
gone for but I funked them. What do you say--shall
we try again and do our level best?</q></p>

<p><q>If you like, so long as you don't hate me if I beat
you.</q></p>

<p><q>Hate you, Violetta--by the way, it used to be
Violetta at Normanhurst.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't remember.</q></p>

<p>But she did quite well.</p>

<p><q>Well, it must be Violetta once more. No. I won't
hate you whatever you do--I couldn't. Now I warn
you, I'm going to play as I never played before. I've
a horrible feeling that you ought to give me twenty in a
hundred.</q></p>

<p><q>Nonsense. Do you always have nervous fears you
won't succeed when you attempt anything?</q> asked
Violetta a little scornfully.</p>

<p><q>Very often, I own.</q></p>

<p><q>It's a great mistake. Haven't you heard the old
foxhunter's advice when about to jump a fence? Throw
your heart over first, he said, and your horse will follow.
It's true.</q></p>

<p><q>By Jove, that's a fact. Then we start level. I
break, I suppose, according to the rules.</q></p>

<p>Violetta, nodding, chalked her cue.</p>

<p>Norman gave the customary safety miss and Violetta
going for the red accomplished a difficult cannon. The
positions that followed were easy, and so far from
fumbling and mis-cueing as in the first game, she kept
the balls well together and left off with a start of
twenty-five and with a double baulk for her op-
ponent.</p>

<p><q>You take my breath away. See what you've
left me.</q></p>

<pb n="66"/>
<p><q>Not much, I admit. Are you going in for bold-
ness? There's a possible cannon on.</q></p>

<p><q>I daresay, but it's not possible for me. My choice
lies between safety and a fluke. I'll try the latter just
to show you I haven't forgotten what the huntsman
said.</q></p>

<p>He struck the ball recklessly. The cannon was not
achieved, but unexpectedly he went in off the red.
The latter was in baulk and Violetta's ball tucked under
the cushion. Naturally, he left the white alone and
played at the red. He missed it, and his own ball
remained in baulk.</p>

<p>The stroke in front of Violetta was enormously
difficult. Her ball was at the top end of the table and
almost angled. She could hardly expect to do more
than go for one or the other ball and not attempt to
score.</p>

<p><q>You'll have to trust to your luck this time, Violetta,</q>
Norman explained.</p>

<p><q>Indeed I won't. I'm going to pot the red and maybe
my own ball too. At least, that's what I shall try
for. They're nearly in a direct line from where I am.</q></p>

<p>Norman held his breath while he watched her.
Violetta's statuesque pose while measuring the distance
with her eye and estimating the exact amount of force
necessary, seemed to Norman to personify the very
poetry of billiards.</p>

<p>Violetta was wearing the dress in which she arrived,
her everyday wardrobe not having yet come to hand.
Her corsage was in the fashion favoured by pretty
women to whom nature has generously given full
curves. It was cut low at the neck and back, the sleeves
were very short and there was a studied absence of
trimmings in the way of frills, lace and whatnot.
Obviously the costume was very trying to those not
qualified to wear it. Violetta would have taken first
prize in a competition in this style of dress.</p>

<p>Her arms were beautifully shaped, as Norman could
<pb n="67"/>
not help seeing when she had to hold the cue at an
angle of nearly sixty degrees in order to strike the ball
at the exact spot. The position of the body and the
elevated right arm slackened the front of the bodice,
and for an instant the symmetrical lines of the bust
were revealed. Her eyes were fixed steadily on the
object ball and the brows slightly drawn together.
For a couple of seconds she stood motionless, and then
in a flash the statue came to life.</p>

<p>It was a moment of concentrated energy. Force
was not so much wanted as a restraint of force. The
exact pace had to be given to the ball and no more.
It rolled along as if conscious of the skilful hands that
had guided it. It clicked the red ball gently and sent
it very slowly into the pocket and followed behind
as if to make assurance doubly sure.</p>

<p><q>Great Scott!</q> ejaculated Norman. <q>Who on
earth taught you to do that? John Roberts himself
couldn't beat it.</q></p>

<p><q>My father was a very fine billiard player. I learned
from him pretty well all I know.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, but you must have practised an awful lot.
You can't become a player of your rank in five min-
utes.</q></p>

<p><q>I suppose I was an apt pupil,</q> laughed Violetta.</p>

<p>She did not think it necessary to add that she had
many spare hours at the club, and that she often devoted
them to billiards. She became so expert that she had
no hesitation in opposing the best players among the
members. As more than one were little better than
sharpers and up to every trick of the game, it is more
than probable she learned as much from them as from
her father.</p>

<p>The game proceeded. The feat just described was
the only one out of the common that she indulged in,
and she did not trouble to do more than run up a break
out of easy shots. Of course, she won, but she let
him down easy, and ran out the victor by ten points.
<pb n="68"/>
Norman took his defeat very good-humouredly and
was warm in his praise.</p>

<p><q>That ten points doesn't represent the real difference
between us. You could give me twenty-five--thirty
in a hundred and still beat me to a frazzle. You're a
witch at the game. I only know one man--among
amateurs, I mean--who could meet you on level
ground.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes? Does he come here?</q></p>

<p><q>No, and I wouldn't have him. We were great
chums at Oxford, and he was a decent chap, I always
thought. But since then--well, he's turned out a
blackguard. I don't think I'd care to come across
him now. There might be ructions.</q></p>

<p>John Norman's face darkened and, turning abruptly
from Violetta, he walked to the fire and stood looking
at the blazing coals, his back turned towards his com-
panion.</p>

<p>Had he chosen to glance at Violetta he would have
seen that she was as much disturbed as he himself was.
It had crossed her mind with a feeling of certainty that
the man he referred to was George Godfree. She knew
his method of play quite well and could just hold her
own with him.</p>

<p>Norman turned. His face had resumed its usual
composure.</p>

<p><q>Shall we play the conqueror? You to give me
thirty points?</q></p>

<p><q>No. We've each won a game. Let's remain on
terms of equality.</q></p>

<p><q>As you please. What about a cigarette? I'll
bet that you smoke. You couldn't possibly have
found out all you know about billiards without.</q></p>

<p><q>How long will Ella be?</q> she asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p><q>What? Are you among the crowd that Ella
rules with a rod of iron?</q></p>

<p><q>Not quite that. I know her views on the matter,
and I don't want to hurt her feelings.</q></p>

<pb n="69"/>
<p><q>Ella's feelings? I doubt whether she has any.
Real feeling, I mean. It's funny that whenever any
family matter is under discussion the first thing every-
body asks is what Ella will think--what will she say?
She exercises some horrible spell. I find myself under
its influence constantly. Are you going to alter your
mind?</q> and he held out his cigarette case, but Violetta
shook her head.</p>

<p>They were now seated on a Chesterfield in front of
the fire and Violetta made no reply to Norman's
reference to Ella. At the same time, she quite agreed
with him, for she remembered how at school Ella in
her semi-hysterical <soCalled>swarming</soCalled> way dominated the
rest. Violetta used to think that Ella would de-
velop into an extremely unpleasant tyrannical old
woman.</p>

<p>Norman went on smoking silently and staring at
the fire. Suddenly he broke out:</p>

<p><q>I suppose she's told you all about my mad folly--
racing, betting, the loss of Normanhurst, and all the
rest of my crazy doings?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, she referred in a way to your heavy losses.
It came upon me quite as a shock to hear that you had
to sell Normanhurst.</q></p>

<p><q>It was a bit of a wrench, and it's left me stranded--
just for the moment--but &#x2026;&#x2026;</q></p>

<p><q>Then you have some plans for the future,</q> put in
Violetta, to fill up a somewhat embarrassing pause.</p>

<p><q>In a way. I've sworn to be master of Normanhurst
once more, but how the deuce I'm going to do it beats
me. You see, I'm left entirely to myself, and I'm
not much good by myself. Ella knows that as well
as I do, and she's perpetually worrying me with sugges-
tions, all more or less impracticable. What I want is
some clever shrewd person always at my elbow--
one I can talk to--one that'll do things and not dream
over them. <emph>I</emph> can do the dreaming--done too much
of it already.</q></p>

<pb n="70"/>
<p><q>You need some friend to protect you against your-
self? Is that what you mean?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, you've hit it.</q></p>

</div>


<div n="8" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter VIII</head>
<head type="main">A Chapter from the Past</head>

<p><q>Yes, you've hit it,</q> repeated Sir John. He had
turned his eyes from the fire to Violetta and he allowed
them to rest upon her.</p>

<p>Violetta's pose just then was highly attractive. She
was leaning slightly forward, her knees crossed and her
clasped hands embracing the upper one. The attitude
suggested energy, independence; it seemed to indicate
that she was mistress of herself; that she was not one
to yield to momentary impulses; that she was alert
and ready of resource in cases of difficulty. The small
compact head, the full neck set on firmly rounded
shoulders confirmed this view of her character. Even
the shapely arms had character in them.</p>

<p><q>You have Ella to talk to,</q> said she.</p>

<p><q>Bother Ella. She's always been the obstacle.
We never agree on a single point and aren't likely to.
Discussions with her always take an unpleasantly
personal tone, with any number of <q>I told you so's.</q>
She can't understand the influence of circumstances on
character on one's destiny. Can you, Miss Vaughan
--I beg your pardon--Violetta I should have said?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. No one better. I've seen it verified ever so
many times.</q></p>

<p><q>Then when I tell you I've been an ass you won't
believe it's entirely owing to myself?</q></p>

<p><q>Of course I shan't. In cases of extreme foolishness
so much depends not only on circumstances but on
<pb n="71"/>
other people. You remember what a French philosopher
once said--<q>to know all is to forgive all.</q></q></p>

<p><q>By the lord, it <emph>is</emph> so. Look here, Violetta, I'm
wondering if I should bore you very much if I told you
something about what Ella calls my childish folly?
I promise to boil the story down to shreds.</q></p>

<p><q>If it will give you any satisfaction, by all means
tell me. I'll be the most patient of listeners.</q></p>

<p><q>Thanks. The business really began with my
marriage. I was only a youngster--just come of age.
My father was old and feeble, and he'd got a yearning
to see a grandson in the world. He didn't want the
baronetcy to go to any male relation outside the direct
line. He mentioned the girl he wished me to many
--the daughter of an old friend. I've always looked
upon what some people call the serious steps in life
as trifles, and it seemed to me it didn't matter who was
my wife so long as she was amiable and decent looking.</q></p>

<p><q>You were easily pleased at twenty-one. Have
you become more fastidious since?</q> asked Violetta
meditatively.</p>

<p><q>Can't say. Perhaps. Certainly I don't think doll
faces appeal to me. Poor Alice had a doll face. Round
blue eyes, a small mouth, dimples when she laughed
and fair wavy hair. I suppose we were equally matched
as to brains. We both made a mistake. We were
too much alike--in temperament, I mean. We ought
to have had our opposites. A son, to my father's huge
delight, was born, and two years after came a
catastrophe. The boy was drowned.</q></p>

<p><q>Great Heaven. Why did you tell me?</q> cried
Violetta, with genuine sympathy. <q>Ella has never
mentioned this terrible thing.</q></p>

<p><q>It isn't often raked up,</q> said Norman huskily.
<q>I wanted to forget it, but I never have. I had too
many other misfortunes to remember it by. My wife
was stricken down by the news; she had a child pre-
maturely--stillborn--she had a fever, lost her reason,
<pb n="72"/>
and never regained it. My father also was so much
affected that he died within a year.</q></p>

<p><q>What a frightful list of troubles. I think you're
wonderful, Sir John, to have maintained your cheer-
fulness. When I first saw you I should never have
suspected you kept so sad a story locked up within you.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, some twelve years had passed over, and one
can't be always wearing one's heart on one's sleeve.
That's stupid; besides, it's not my idea of bearing
troubles.</q></p>

<p>He relapsed into silence and seemed so absorbed
that Violetta hardly liked to disturb his reverie. At
last she said:</p>

<p><q>I suppose you now and again visited your wife.
That must have been a painful ordeal.</q></p>

<p><q>At first it was, but I soon got used to it, as she
never recognised me. Some days she was plunged
in melancholy. On others she did nothing but rave.
Her wild talk revealed something I never suspected.
Before I proposed to her she wanted to marry another
man, and it was his name that was always in her
thoughts. Subsequently, I discovered that she really
had been engaged to this man, and she jilted him to
marry me. He thought I was to blame, but I knew
nothing of her prior engagement. In fact, they kept
it a secret.</q></p>

<p><q>Have you ever met him?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes--since Lady Norman died.</q></p>

<p><q>And are you on speaking terms?</q></p>

<p>Norman smiled grimly.</p>

<p><q>Not exactly. I think he'd like to cut my throat.
He's got it into his head that my wife went out of her
mind through me. It's utterly false.</q></p>

<p><q>You never injured him, then?</q></p>

<p><q>Robbing a man of a girl he'd set his heart upon
would be an injury, wouldn't it?</q></p>

<p><q>Not if you did it unknowingly.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, he didn't take that view. But we needn't
<pb n="73"/>
bother about him further than to say that I believe
he's at the bottom of my ruin, though he was far too
cunning to show himself.</q></p>

<p><q>Who were the men who were acting for him?</q>
asked Violetta with sudden interest.</p>

<p>Norman looked at her slightly surprised. He was
not a man of quick perception, but he could not help
seeing that she did not put the question out of mere
curiosity.</p>

<p><q>Oh, there was a gang. There always is, I believe,
in a racing swindle, and when they quarrel over the spoil
the truth oozes out, but the honest man--otherwise
the victim, doesn't necessarily come into his own.
I was induced to buy some wretched platers and was
kidded into believing that they were <soCalled>dark</soCalled> horses,
certain to win and at long odds I should have netted
a fortune. I never won a race.</q></p>

<p><q>But didn't you know someone of the gang outside
racing? You wouldn't have believed downright
strangers, would you?</q></p>

<p><q>Of course not, and that's where the sting comes in.
The man I mentioned some time ago--the billiard
player--my own friend--let me down. I don't want
to talk about him. I've wiped the blackguard out
of my life.</q></p>

<p>Violetta dared not ask for this man's name. There
was no necessity. Ella had told her. She glanced at
Norman's face. She seemed to read in it more determina-
tion than she had hitherto credited him with possessing.
Maybe his inertness and indecision had their origin
in the fact that he had always taken things too easily
and had allowed others to think for him. He had
indeed hinted at this defect in his character. Maybe
if he were forced to fight for himself he would show he
could do it.</p>

<p>Then his features relaxed. The resolute look passed
away. He relapsed into his habitual dreaminess.</p>

<p><q>I wish, Violetta, you hadn't left Normanhurst
<pb n="74"/>
four years ago. When you were gone I felt horribly
restless. I wanted excitement. The country had lost
its attraction. I took a furnished flat in London and
that's where the trouble began. Why did you go?</q></p>

<p><q>I had to. My father needed me.</q></p>

<p><q>Your father? He'd been in the Army, hadn't
he? What did he want you for?</q></p>

<p><q>Various things. We'd always been a good deal
together. He was accustomed to rely upon me. Really,
we were more like chums than father and daughter.
I felt I couldn't leave him to shift for himself.</q></p>

<p><q>And he's dead--so I understand from Ella.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, he was killed riding in a steeplechase. It was
about the last thing one would have expected. He
was a splendid horseman.</q></p>

<p><q>His death must have made you hate racing and
all that belongs to it. Wasn't that so?</q></p>

<p>Violetta evaded the question.</p>

<p><q>Has your ill luck made <emph>you</emph> hate it?</q> said she.</p>

<p><q>By heaven, I loathe it. I'll never again risk a
farthing on a horse, and I'll never trust a woman who
does.</q></p>

<p>Was this meant as a warning to her? Why should
it? There could be no significance in his words beyond
an expression of his own tastes. He knew nothing
of her life--of her experience. She wondered if he
had that knowledge what he would think of her.</p>

<p><q>You're rather hard upon women who bet,</q> said
she, quietly.</p>

<p><q>I've reason to be. But we needn't go into that.</q></p>

<p>So there was a woman at the bottom of the trouble.
Knowing the racing world as she did, Violetta would
have been surprised if there hadn't been.</p>

<p><q>Raking up the past is stupid and profitless. It's
the future that matters, isn't it? I should like to
hear how you propose getting back Normanhurst.</q></p>

<p><q>I've told you I don't know. I'm totally ignorant
of soap making, motor manufacturing, or anything
<pb n="75"/>
like that. It would have been better if I'd been
brought up to a business. It would have kept me out of
temptation, wouldn't it?</q> and he laughed a little
bitterly.</p>

<p><q>You can make money in business without knowing
anything about the business itself. It only wants
capital and brains.</q></p>

<p>Violetta's frankness did not offend him in the least.
On the contrary it amused him.</p>

<p><q>Thanks,</q> said he, smilingly. <q>You've spotted
the two weak points.</q></p>

<p><q>I suppose they can be remedied. Was Norman-
hurst your only landed property?</q></p>

<p><q>No. I've a ramshackle place about ten miles distant
from it that's never brought in more than ¬£50 a year.
The house is beastly ugly and the soil's so barren I
didn't think it worth while to try to mortgage it. It's
called the Owl's Nest and there never was a more appro-
priate title.</q></p>

<p><q>The Owl's Nest! How romantic it sounds! Is
it picturesque?</q></p>

<p><q>Rather. That's its only recommendation. Between
ourselves, I'd a fancy for taking up my quarters there
when the crash came, but Ella shrieked when I suggested
it. She declared that the place was haunted, and my
argument that spooks were in her line--perhaps she
hasn't told you that she's a bit gone on spiritualism--
went for nothing. Of course, I gave in for the sake
of peace and quietness, and so we came to this show,
which I never particularly cared for, and which I'm
now heartily sick of. But I may like it better now
you've come.</q></p>

<p>Violetta took no notice of the implied compliment.
She brushed it aside impatiently.</p>

<p><q>I want to hear more about the Owl's Nest. Do tell
me. Is it occupied?</q></p>

<p><q>No, and it hasn't been for over a year. I doubt
if the house is inhabitable.</q></p>

<pb n="76"/>
<p><q>I should like to see it.</q></p>

<p><q>Would you? There's no difficulty. We could
motor there in an hour and a half.</q></p>

<p><q>How jolly. When can we go? To-morrow?</q></p>

<p><q>All the days are the same to me. To-morrow, if
you like.</q></p>

<p><q>I suppose Ella wouldn't go?</q> Violetta's question
was not put with much enthusiasm.</p>

<p><q>Not she. I don't see that we want her. You're
not afraid of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grundy, are you?</q></p>

<p><q>Isn't <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grundy out of date these days?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, yes. Jazz dancing, bare backs and the
divorce court have been too much for the old lady.
And a good thing too, don't you think so?</q></p>

<p><q>I won't commit myself to that opinion. It all
depends upon the person and circumstances.</q></p>

<p>At that moment there was a bustle in the lobby outside
and Ella bounced in.</p>

<p><q>You two look pretty comfy I must say,</q> she ex-
claimed in not a particularly pleased tone. <q>I thought
you came here to play billiards.</q></p>

<p><q>And so we did. We've had two games. I beat
Violetta in one and she beat me in the other.</q></p>

<p><q>How did she manage that? You let her win, I
suppose.</q></p>

<p><q>No. It was the other way about. She let <emph>me</emph>
win the first game, and in the second she simply ran
away from me.</q></p>

<p>Ella's face became as unpleasant as her voice.</p>

<p><q>How on earth did you learn to play so well? I
almost feel inclined to quote the worn saying that skill
at billiards is evidence of an ill-spent youth.</q></p>

<p><q>It's a question of comparison, my dear. It doesn't
follow that I play well because I beat your brother.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course not,</q> put in Sir John with a chuckle.
<q>What <emph>does</emph> follow is that I played dashed bad.</q></p>

<p>Ella tossed her head. She did not pursue the
subject. She turned to her brother in her spasmodic way.</p>

<pb n="77"/>
<p><q>You'll be glad to hear, John, that I've had a most
successful morning.</q></p>

<p><q>What, has the Vicar promised to lend his church
for one of your performances?</q></p>

<p><q>Don't be stupid. No. I found a number of most
interesting people at the Vicarage. The talk turned
upon spiritualism, and I was amazed to find how many
of the party had taken up the study. Some of them
have had the most satisfactory results.</q></p>

<p><q>What do you mean by satisfactory?</q></p>

<p><q>Why, they've had most convincing proof of the
possibility of communicating with the other world.</q></p>

<p><q>Really. What did the Vicar say to that? Poaching
on his preserves, wasn't it? I've always had an idea
that the church was supposed to look after the other
world for us.</q></p>

<p><q>We didn't let him know what we were talking about.
It so happened that those who were interested in the
subject were sitting together. Of course we couldn't
talk freely, as he was present and we didn't know how
he would take it. I was afraid he might reprove us
and in an argument with a clergyman one always feels
at a disadvantage--you can't contradict the man
without an uncomfortable sensation that you're guilty
of blasphemy. So we agreed to meet again and compare
our experiences.</q></p>

<p><q>Hang it, Ella, what experiences have <emph>you</emph> had?</q></p>

<p><q>Not any, but I want to have some. We've arranged
to hold a seance here to-morrow evening. The little
round table in the spare room will do splendidly. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Parry has offered to bring a wonderful medium--
a <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe, who by a great piece of
luck happens to be staying here. We're bound to have
some remarkable manifestations if all that's said about
her is true.</q></p>

<p>John Norman stared blankly at his sister. He was
biting his lips and frowning slightly. Apparently he
did not welcome the prospect of the avalanche.</p>

<pb n="78"/>
<p><q>I've been thinking, John, that you might do worse
than go in for spiritualism as a hobby. It would take
you completely out of yourself.</q></p>

<p><q>Thanks. I'm quite contented with myself as I
am, and I don't want to be anybody else. So far as
spiritualism is concerned, I hate it, and you needn't
reckon upon me to-morrow night.</q></p>

<p>Norman spoke with unwonted asperity and his
self-assertion evidently took Ella by surprise.</p>

<p><q>Do as you like, of course, but it'll be very awkward.
What excuse am I to offer? How am I to explain
your refusal to join us when you're in the house all
the time?</q></p>

<p><q>That's where you're wrong. I shan't be in the house.
I've promised to motor Violetta to the Owl's Nest. I've
been telling her about it and its reputation for being
haunted. She's most anxious to see it. Possibly
we shall have a better chance there of running across
a ghost than you'll have here.</q></p>

<p><q>Motor Violetta to the Owl's Nest,</q> repeated Ella,
her face suddenly growing very long. <q>It's absurd.
You must put off the excursion. Any other day but
to-morrow will do just as well. Have you promised
to go, Violetta?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. I was looking forward to it, but as you say,
another day will do just as well.</q></p>

<p><q>Indeed it won't,</q> broke in Norman, half angrily.
<q>I hate putting things off--especially for the sake of
people I don't know and don't want to know. After
what Violetta has just said, I shan't disappoint her.</q></p>

<p><q>But surely, Violetta, under the circumstances you
wouldn't think of going?</q> cried Ella petulantly.</p>

<p><q>If Sir John insists, I don't know how I can refuse.</q></p>

<p>Violetta from the corner of her eye could see a look
of relief stealing over Norman's face. It looked as if
a contest of wills between brother and sister was going
on, and she determined to back him up for all she was
worth. From what she had seen of the Norman house-
<pb n="79"/>
hold she had decided that it was time John Norman
asserted himself.</p>

<p><q>Oh, very well,</q> snapped Ella, and she swept from
the room, her features twitching and suggesting that
she was on the verge of tears.</p>

<div n="9" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter IX</head>
<head type="main">Violetta's <q>Joy-Ride</q></head>

<p>The evening passed in a not particularly lively fashion.
Ella was alternately snappy and sulky. Her brother
was distraught and Violetta felt bored to death. She
played and sang out of sheer desperation, and did not
much care whether or not she was entertaining her
friends. Her hostess professed a slight indisposition
and could not be persuaded into doing anything.
Evidently she did not look upon the proposed trip to
the Owl's Nest with approval. Violetta was quite glad
when the time came to say good-night. Before going
to bed, she sat for some time in a comfortable, padded
wicker chair, nursing her knee--her favourite attitude
when she wanted to think over things. On the whole,
she was more interested in Sir John Norman than she
had expected. She no longer had any idea of captivating
him. That notion, if she had ever meant it seriously,
had passed away, but it was not from any mercenary
motive. She wanted money, it was true, but she was
not anxious to get it by marrying a rich man. It might
mean a sacrifice of her independence and she valued
her freedom more than anything in life. The discovery,
therefore, that the baronet was ruined did not come
as the disappointment which she would have felt had
she fixed upon him as her husband.</p>

<p>At the same time, he <emph>did</emph> interest her. She was not
<pb n="80"/>
clear why it was so. She was inclined to put it down
to her innate antagonism towards Ella. Outwardly
Ella had always been very friendly with her, but the
two had never come into conflict over any vital matter.
Violetta was not one to take any account of trifling
differences of opinion, and she had always given way.</p>

<p>Somehow she now felt inclined for active hostilities.
It angered her to see Ella domineering over her brother,
and it angered her still more to find the man tamely
submitting.</p>

<p><q>It's no business of mine, anyway,</q> she told herself.
<q>I suppose I shall have to stay some little time as
I've sent for my things and it would be stupid to quarrel
with Ella just because her brother hasn't pluck enough
to stand up for himself.</q></p>

<p>She smiled. It had occurred to her that a little drama
was beginning in the unexpected determination of
Sir John to have his own way, and that this determina-
tion was primarily due to herself. But mightn't there
be some other motive at work? Why was Norman so
set against a spiritualistic seance? She, Violetta,
would rather have liked it. <soCalled>Cranks</soCalled> of any sort
were entertaining once in a way. She did not think
that the baronet was afraid of <soCalled>cranks</soCalled> or had any
particular objection to a seance <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="roman">per se</foreign>. His manner
suggested some personal dislike.</p>

<p><q>Perhaps there may be more fun here than I imagined
at first</q> was her final comment, and with hope in her
mind she went peacefully to sleep.</p>

<p>It was clear the next morning that Ella had not re-
covered her good temper. She did not appear at the
breakfast table and sent down word that she had a bad
headache. Sir John, on the other hand, had risen
early. He was anxious, he explained, not to be dis-
appointed about the car, and had gone to the garage
before breakfast.</p>

<p><q>It's all right,</q> said he. <q>Shall we start about
eleven? Will that suit you?</q></p>

<pb n="81"/>
<p><q>Admirably. I shall enjoy the ride immensely,
I'm sure. It's a delightful morning, and promises
to be an ideal spring day. I'm sorry, though, I haven't
any proper motor costume. Do you mind?</q></p>

<p><q><emph>I</emph> don't mind. Why should I? It's you who
ought to worry. But you don't seem much troubled.</q></p>

<p>Violetta, as a matter of fact, was in great good humour
and was looking her best. She had had misgivings
that Norman's courage might have oozed out during
the night, and was rejoiced to find that it hadn't. In
addition, her belongings had arrived from the hotel
in London, and this was a special source of satisfaction.
No woman likes to depend upon a single dress no matter
how well she may look in it.</p>

<p><q>Troubled? No indeed. I'm never troubled when
I'm expecting a pleasure.</q></p>

<p><q>I hope it will be one. Anyway, I shall have nothing
to prevent me devoting myself entirely to you. I'm
an awful ass where motoring is concerned, so we shall
have a chauffeur to take the responsibility. I know
it's not the right thing. Almost as bad as a boating
man having someone to row for him.</q></p>

<p><q>Luckily, I'm neither a motorist or a boating
woman, so it doesn't matter, does it?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know that it does. Still, it won't be what's
called a joy ride.</q></p>

<p><q>And what's that?</q> asked Violetta, as demure as
the lady depicted in Milton's <q>Penseroso.</q></p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p><q>It must be experienced, I believe. It can't be
described. Part of the enjoyment, I understand, consists
in getting every ounce of speed out of the car and
defying the regulations.</q></p>

<p><q>I shouldn't at all mind that--on a horse.</q></p>

<p>He became a little graver.</p>

<p><q>I suppose not. I remember your splendid riding
at Normanhurst. I've given up thinking about horses.</q></p>

<p><q>Not for ever, surely?</q></p>

<pb n="82"/>
<p><q>If I keep in my present mind it may be so, but we
won't talk about horses, please.</q></p>

<p><q>You ought to have gone in for training in motoring,
then you'd have a topic you'd have plenty to say about.
I'm told motor talk's most engrossing.</q></p>

<p><q>I know--I know. I've run across motor maniacs.
They open their mouths over nothing else. It's all
gibberish to me. Don't worry. Where <emph>you</emph> are Violetta
there'll be no lack of a subject for conversation.</q></p>

<p><q>Thanks. I didn't know I could let my tongue
run away with me.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't mean that.</q></p>

<p>He shot her a glance, the meaning of which Violetta
understood quite well, and she left it at that.</p>

<p><q>Will you give me half an hour, please, to get ready?</q>
said she.</p>

<p><q>Take your time, but don't be longer than you can
help. Between ourselves, I'd like to get away before
Ella shows up. I upset her last night, and she's horrid
when she's put out. I hate to start the day with a row,
don't you?</q></p>

<p>Violetta nodded and tripped away. She joined him
within the half hour. He was pacing the room rest-
lessly, a cigarette between his lips. She thought he
looked worried, but she made no remark. He brightened
when his eyes lighted upon her, as well they might, for
she presented an engaging picture with her tailor made
skirt, blouse, up and down collar, and scarf, the pin
of which added a provoking touch of coquetry. The
masculine suggestions of her costume suited her
amazingly. Her hat was a little sailor straw, with a
feather artfully disposed.</p>

<p><q>By Jove, one would think you were about to mount
a horse rather than a motor,</q> he could not help saying.</p>

<p><q>I thought you didn't want horses mentioned.</q></p>

<p><q>Perhaps I didn't explain myself. I meant horse
racing. Anyhow, let's be off.</q></p>

<p>As the car started Violetta glanced at one of the
<pb n="83"/>
upper windows. She saw the blind shift slightly, and
she laughed. Ella was on the watch. Violetta had
in a way thrown down the gauntlet.</p>

<p>Soon they were bowling along the high road. Pres-
ently the car turned into a lane and the chauffeur
slackened speed.</p>

<p><q>It's a cross-country run to Weltersfield, sir. I
suppose you'd like me to take the shortest cut?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not so sure about that. What do you say?</q></p>

<p>He had turned to Violetta.</p>

<p><q>There's no hurry, I suppose,</q> said she. <q>I should
like to see as much as I can of English scenery. I've
been away for a long time you know, and there's nothing
on the Continent like the fresh green of our country.
I missed the English hedgerows terribly.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well, then, we'll go by the prettiest route
and chance it being the longest. It's between thirty
and forty miles, I suppose, to Weltersfield, eh?</q></p>

<p><q>Quite that, sir.</q></p>

<p><q>Nothing for a motor ride, so we'll go leisurely.
No <soCalled>scorching</soCalled> mind.</q></p>

<p>The chauffeur's wooden face never moved. Going
leisurely was not his idea of motoring. His difficulty
would be keeping within his instructions.</p>

<p><q>Whereabouts <emph>is</emph> Weltersfield?</q> asked Violetta.</p>

<p><q>On the borders of Surrey, ten miles from Norman-
hurst. As I told you, I should have gone there but
for Ella. Plenty of rabbit shooting but not much good
for anything else. If you're fond of the picturesque
you'll get it there. An artist friend I showed it to
raved over the views.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, that's something, anyhow. You don't
sketch, I suppose?</q></p>

<p><q>No. I'm fond of pictures and all that, but nothing
more. To tell you the truth, Violetta, I don't believe
I'm good at anything--excepting,</q> he added with a
queer sort of laugh, <q>at being fooled.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, we're most of us touched a bit that way at
<pb n="84"/>
times, I fancy. We can't always be wise. It would
be an awfully dull world if it weren't for the fools.
They contribute largely to the gaiety of nations.</q></p>

<p><q>That's your idea, is it? Then you don't think
I'm an absolute ass because I allowed myself to be
taken in?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't see why I should. I told you so last night.
It's generally the people we trust we have to thank
for our misfortunes, where money's concerned.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, yes. The odd thing was I discovered that
what I thought I knew most about I knew least. Horses
were always my hobby until I went in for keeping racers,
but even then if I hadn't been let down by the man
I trusted I mightn't have been so smashed up. You
see, he induced me to buy a lot of crocks which turned
out frauds. But this wasn't the worst. The best horse
I bought was on my own judgment. I backed it for
all I was worth to win the Derby, and I'll swear it
would, too, but at the last moment it was got at or
the jockey was. Do you know what that means?</q></p>

<p><q>I think I can guess.</q></p>

<p><q>And that's how I came to grief. Then--hang it,
Violetta, I entreated you not to talk about horse racing,
and here I am prancing about on forbidden ground!
I've said enough. Tell me something about yourself
just to change one's thoughts. What did you do in
Paris?</q></p>

<p>Violetta had no difficulty in reeling off actual and
imaginary experiences, but not a word did she breathe
about racing or gambling.</p>

<p>She saw plainly enough that Norman in his present
mood detested both. No doubt it was a case either of
a burnt child dreading the fire or of the old adage of the
devil being sick, etc.; and maybe if Norman was again
in possession of money his interest in horses might revive,
but this point just now Violetta was not called upon to
decide. She wanted to amuse him and she succeeded.
Gradually the nervousness and occasional fits of
<pb n="85"/>
absorption which Violetta had noticed disappeared, and
he chatted as in the old days at Normanhurst.</p>

<p>They lunched at Cobham and sat talking for some time
afterwards. The spectre of Ella not hanging over the
feast, Violetta had no scruple in indulging in cigarettes.
Norman complimented her on her smoking.</p> 

<p><q>You smoke like a man--you don't hurry. The
idea of most women is that a cigarette should be burnt
away as quickly as possible.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I've noticed it is so. Perhaps that's why
I don't do it. I don't always follow the example of
other women.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm glad of that,</q> said he, in what sounded almost
like a tone of relief.</p>

<p><q>Why?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, it doesn't matter. As one goes through life
one learns things, that's all.</q></p>

<p>Had Violetta cared to avail herself of the opening,
she could have teased him as to his views of women, but
she remembered the tragedy of his married life, and
she let him alone.</p>

<p>They strolled about Cobham and did not resume the
journey for some time. It was but a ten mile ride to
Weltersfield, and had they gone by the nearest road
they would have passed Normanhurst. But Norman
could not face the sight of the old house, and directed
the chauffeur down a series of lanes by which the estate
was avoided. The car finally emerged upon a fine
breezy common on the other side of which was a road
which led past a small estate bordered by an oak fence
wire barbed at the top. On the other side of the fence
was a broad stretch of meadow land, and beyond,
sheltered by pine trees, was a squat house, a plain,
square, uncompromising sort of building--dull brick
with a door in the centre and a window each side, and
three windows above. At the side was an extensive
range of outbuildings.</p>

<p>Some horses were grazing in the meadow, and between
<pb n="86"/>
them and the house stood a short thick-set man with
slightly bowed legs and somewhat stooping in the
shoulders. A companion to whom he was talking was
slim, undersized, and with the unmistakable look of
a jockey about him.</p>

<p>Violetta took in the shape and build of the horses,
their shining, sleek, well-groomed coats and their springy
walk, with the delight of a connoisseur. She noted
the men and their surroundings, and she knew perfectly
well she was passing a trainer's headquarters. But
mindful of Norman's injunction, she did not say a
word.</p>

<p>Suddenly the motor engine gave one of those irritating
alarming explosions to which the mechanism is liable.
The full-blooded horses, startled by the sound, set off
on a stampede. It was a pretty sight but not to the
trainer or his companion. They both shouted and
set off to head the frightened steeds. Fortunately,
no harm was done as they had raced in the direction
of a high hedge, against which one was cannoned by
the rest, but suffered no hurt. It might have been
otherwise had they rushed for the fence. Doubtless
the men expressed their feelings vigorously, but they
were too far away for their words to be heard.</p>

<p><q>Confound it,</q> she heard Norman mutter. <q>What
the mischief made the thing explode just here. If any
of those gees had come to grief I'd have had to make it
up to old Peter Gumley, though I suppose legally he'd
have no claim against me or the chauffeur either.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you know him?</q> asked Violetta.</p>

<p><q>Know Peter Gumley? I should think I did. The
most honest trainer who ever handled horseflesh.
Doesn't bet. Imagine that. But I forgot you know
nothing about trainers or betting.</q></p>

<p><q>They're lovely horses, and I'm glad none of them
were hurt.</q></p>

<p><q>So am I. Peter Gumley and I were once great
pals, and I was an ass to fall out with him. It was a
<pb n="87"/>
misunderstanding, engineered, as I've reason to know,
by enemies of both of us.</q></p>

<p>Norman said no more, and Violetta asked him no
questions, but she treasured up the name of Peter
Gumley.</p>

<p>The trainer's quarters were left behind, and about
a mile further on the aspect of the country began to
change. The road ascended, skirting a typical Surrey
common covered with gorse and bracken, interspersed
with thickets of bramble and holly. Ahead to the
right were rolling downs and to the left woods with
here and there clumps of tall pines. The ground was
broken, the road still ascending was as full of turns
as a snake, and the loose sharp-edged stones showed
that there was little or no traffic. The car was traversing
what was practically a spur of the long range of chalk
hills, of which at Guildford the Hog's Back was a portion.</p>

<p><q>I don't much like this travelling, sir,</q> said the
chauffeur, jerking round his head. <q>It'll be a miracle
if we get through without a puncture. Is the place
far?</q></p>

<p><q>About half a mile. Go slowly.</q></p>

<p><q>Slow or fast won't make a razor-edged pebble any
better,</q> grumbled the chauffeur. <q>The road's worse
the farther one goes.</q></p>

<p><q>Shall we get out and walk?</q></p>

<p><q>It 'ud be as well I <emph>do</emph> think, sir.</q></p>

<p><q>What do you say, Violetta?</q></p>

<p><q>I should like it. I'm feeling rather cramped.</q></p>

<p><q>Are you? Sorry. I don't mind confessing I'm
a bit that way myself. Here goes.</q></p>

<p>He opened the door sprang to the ground and assisted
Violetta to alight.</p>

<p><q>Wait here,</q> said he to the chauffeur. <q>We may
be some time. Here's a cigar to while away the time.</q></p>

<p>The chauffeur took the corona gratefully, and put
down Sir John in his mind as a real gentleman.</p>

<p><q>Some toffs would ha' kicked up a shindy,</q> he
<pb n="88"/>
remarked to himself. <q>He's got a proper sort o' girl
with him too. She knows how to walk. It's a treat
to see a pair o' ankles just the right shape, and shoes as
don't have egg boilers for heels. Neat figure, dashed
if she aint.</q></p>

<p>And the better to enjoy the pleasing picture, the
chauffeur sat down on a grassy bank commanding a
view of the winding road and watched the couple toiling
up the ascent.</p>

<p><q>You see now why I've so much difficulty in letting
the Owl's Nest. It's such a climb to get there. Cartage
is a frightful bother. Shops are miles away, and the
butcher and baker often forget to call or are too lazy
to fag up the hill.</q></p>

<p><q>That's true. One would have to turn vegetarian
to avoid starvation. I suppose there's accommodation
for a cow?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, yes, and a jolly fine paddock for pasture.
It's the only piece of level ground there is.</q></p>

<p><q>Why don't you sell the place?</q></p>

<p><q>Who'd buy it? Might make a poultry farm,
perhaps. Maybe you wonder why a house was stuck
here. I'll tell you. It came about when there was
such a scare about Bonaparte invading England more
than a century ago. Some genius suggested that
a number of tower houses should be built on hills between
London and Portsmouth, where a sort of telegraphing
could be carried on by semaphore signalling in the
daytime, and blazing fires at night. Boney never came
and the telegraph houses were useless ever after.</q></p>

<p><q>So the house has a history; that makes it
interesting.</q></p>

<p><q>I suppose it does. Anyhow, something in it must
have interested my father or he wouldn't have bought
it. He used to come here for rabbit shooting. He was
a bit of a recluse and liked his own company better
than anybody else's. I often wonder whether I take
after him.</q></p>

<pb n="89"/>
<p><said>I hope you don't find me boring you,</said> said Violetta,
in a mock reproachful tone.</p>

<p><q>My dear Violetta,</q> began Norman, but went no
further.</p>

<p>They had reached the ground surrounding the house.
It was approached by a narrow winding road and hedged
and fenced around. The foliage of a little wood could
be seen beyond. Norman had brought the keys and
he unlocked the gate.</p>

<p><q>This is the paddock I told you of. It's not very
wide, as you see, but I'm told its half a mile round and
fairly level. It wouldn't make a bad circus.</q></p>

<p><q>You're getting near the forbidden topic,</q> laughed
Violetta. <q>I warn you.</q></p>

<p><q>Thanks. I'll not forget. The house didn't exhaust
the brains of the architect who designed it--what do
you think?</q></p>

<p><q>It's solid enough, and I imagine it was built to last.</q></p>

<p>The Owl's Nest was simply a square brick building
of two storeys. Nothing could be simpler. Between
the house and the paddock was a flower garden of an
irregular shape on slightly higher ground than the
paddock; the house dominated everything.</p>

<p><q>To last? I should think it was. I believe the
foundations are very solid.</q></p>

<p>They entered the house. There were two rooms on a
floor, and in each room was some plain old fashioned
furniture.</p>

<p><q>Mostly Queen Anne stuff. A dealer offered me
¬£250 for the lot, which I guess meant it was worth
three or four times that amount. I wasn't in want of
money then and I refused to sell. Most of it came from
Normanhurst. If ever I'm stranded I suppose it'll
have to go.</q></p>

<p>Violetta was delighted with the place. Its entire
absence of ornamentation did not repel her. The
furniture was quite in keeping with the severity of the
surroundings. They ascended to the roof which was
<pb n="90"/>
approached through a big trap door by a broad step
ladder from one of the rooms. The roof was raised
slightly in the centre to allow the rain to drain into a
broad gutter on one side. Thence it descended to a tank
on the ground.</p>

<p><q>That's for soft water--useful you know for the
garden or the laundry,</q> said Norman. <q>The views
are splendid. My dad liked to smoke his pipe here.
You can see into four counties, I believe.</q></p>

<p>A wall some three feet high surrounded the roof and
against a stack of chimneys was a brazier used at night
in former days for signalling purposes. The air was
delightfully fresh and the sweet fragrant smell of the
pine woods distinctly perceptible. Violetta inhaled
it with pleasure. Her eyes wandered over the landscape
taking in its varied beauties and its lights and shadows.</p>

<p>After a time they descended and inspected the out-
houses built for the rearing of poultry and other live
stock. Everything was in a fair state of repair.</p>

<p><q>Shall we have a look at the wood?</q></p>

<p>Violetta assented, and they crossed the paddock,
and passed through a little wicket gate.</p>

<p>The wood was on the slope of the hill and the ir-
regularity of the ground added to its picturesqueness.
The footpaths were innumerable, but the undergrowth
was so dense that many of them could only be followed
with difficulty.</p>

<p>All at once an opening showed itself. A precipitous
path, practically a series of steps, led down to a pond
upon which the sun was pouring its full brilliance.
It was like coming upon a dazzling mirror. The banks
in some places were steep and at others only of gentle
descent. All were covered with vegetation at present
showing only the tender green of spring, and promising
summer luxuriance. Lichen covered roots had here
and there forced themselves through the loose soil and
by colour and shape added their charm. At one end
a thin stream trickled down huge chalk boulders and
<pb n="91"/>
kept a sufficient movement to prevent the formation
of duckweed save in obstructed patches where a fallen
tree trunk had held up the current. At the end opposite
the miniature waterfall was an outlet and from here
the water had made for itself a passage and after
many twistings found its way to a ditch.</p>

<p><q>How exquisite!</q> cried Violetta, clasping her
hands. <q>Why, it's like fairyland. One can imagine
Oberon and Titania holding their revels here in the
moonlight.</q></p>

<p><q>I told you that artists went mad over it. But it
has practical qualities as well as poetic ones. It's a
rare place for carp and tench.</q></p>

<p><q>And you wanted me to believe that the Owl's Nest
was a kind of Starvation Hall. What with growing
one's own vegetables and what with fish, rabbits, and
poultry, there's not much fear of going short. I noticed
a fine brick oven in the scullery. What's to prevent
baking one's daily bread?</q></p>

<p><q>Nothing whatever. It is, I admit, an ideal Tolstoi
residence. It means a lot of work, though.</q></p>

<p><q>What of that? I'm in love with the place. Do
you want to let it?</q></p>

<p><q>I've no objection but who'd take it?</q></p>

<p><q>I would. What's the rent?</q></p>

<p>Norman stared. He was flabbergasted at the idea.
He looked upon Violetta's proposal as the outcome of a
woman's romance. He said as much.</p>

<p><q>It's not romance at all. I assure you I mean
business, and I'm quite prepared to tackle the hard
work.</q></p>

<p><q>You'd better think over it.</q></p>

<p><q>I <emph>have</emph> thought over it, and I've made up my mind.
You really must take a common-sense view of your
affairs, Sir John, and not let them drift anyhow.</q></p>

<p>Violetta had straightened herself. Her tone was
emphatic. Her eyes shone with a steady light. Her
face, though animated, was firm. She looked more
<pb n="92"/>
masculine than ever. Norman was taken aback.
He recognised her energy but he was incredulous as
to her capacity for such a crazy enterprise.</p>

<p><q>You don't realise the difficulties,</q> he objected.
<q>What's put this Robinson Crusoe idea into your head?
Do you want the place as a haven of rest and pleasure in
the summer time--the delusion of the simple life?</q></p>

<p><q>Not at all. I mean business. Poultry farming.
I'm out to make money. Come, the rent please. What
did the former tenant pay?</q></p>

<p>Norman felt himself cornered by her directness.</p>

<p><q>I don't exactly remember,</q> said he, reluctantly.
<q>¬£50, I think it was.</q></p>

<p><q>Dirt cheap, I call it. If ¬£50 will content you I'll
take it at that.</q></p>

<p><q>But really--the winter time--you'll be horribly
lonely.</q></p>

<p><q>I shall have a capable woman or two about me, and a
man to do the rough work.</q></p>

<p><q>But you can't make friends of them.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I don't know. I can easily invite friends to
stay with me, I suppose.</q></p>

<p><q>No doubt. Ella might, perhaps--</q></p>

<p><q>Ella won't. I don't think she'll approve of my
being your tenant.</q></p>

<p><q>Maybe not,</q> rejoined Norman doubtfully. <q>I
doubt if I shall tell her.</q></p>

<p><q>Do as you like about that. <emph>I</emph> don't care so long
as she <choice><corr>doesn't</corr><orig>does'nt</orig></choice> talk you into giving me notice to quit.</q></p>

<p><q>She won't do that, I promise you, but I daresay
she'll nag me a bit.</q></p>

<p><q>Will you stand it? I suppose a man can't get
away from a nagging wife, but a nagging sister--well!</q></p>

<p>Violetta finished the sentence with an expressive
shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>Norman looked a little shamefaced. He remembered
how long he had endured Ella's tyranny and in the
face of Violetta's rebuke he began to wonder why.
<pb n="93"/>
But at Normanhurst he had to. How could he leave the
place and how could he turn his sister out? Both
courses were impossible. He had always given in to
her to avoid quarrelling. Yet he had escaped from
her domination--for a time. That was when he took
the bold step--for him--of running a flat in London.</p>

<p><q>I shan't tell her,</q> said he presently. <q>This is a
compact between ourselves Violetta, and it has nothing
to do with anyone else.</q></p>

<p><q>Then you agree? Thanks awfully. I suppose
we shall have an agreement or lease, or whatever you
like to call it, drawn up, shan't we? But your lawyer
will see to that. You're not going back from your
word?</q></p>

<p><q>No. I swear--</q></p>

<p><q>You needn't. Your promise will be sufficient.</q></p>

<p><q>You don't bar me from coming to see you?</q></p>

<p><q>A landlord has a right, I fancy, to enter his premises
at a reasonable time and for a sufficient reason. I
daresay you'll want to satisfy yourself that I've kept
the place in proper repair.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't care a fig about that. I can't see myself as
your landlord, Violetta.</q></p>

<p><q>I shan't forget it, and I'll not fail to remind you
every quarter day. Now please let us go back to the
house. I want to begin planning at once. You won't
mind I hope my making a few alterations.</q></p>

<p><q>Make any that pleases you. Pull the house down
if you care to do it.</q></p>

<p><q>Nothing so stupid. I may be silly at times, but
not so silly as all that.</q></p>

<p>They returned to the house. Violetta was full of
ideas. The prospect of a speculative enterprise had
given her new life, and she rattled on, to the surprise
and entertainment of her companion. Suddenly she
looked at her watch.</p>

<p><q>Mercy on us. Do you know we've been here nearly
three hours? What will have become of your car?</q></p>

<pb n="94"/>
<p><q>It should be where we left it. Perhaps we'd better
get back.</q></p>

<p>They found the chauffeur fast asleep and he looked
rather foolish when he was roused.</p>

<p><q>Beg pardon, sir,</q> he stammered. <q>I didn't know
how long you'd be. But a car ain't a horse--it can't
bolt.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, it's all right. Look here, take us on to Guild-
ford. We want to see the country as we go. No
making up for lost time, or anything of that sort.</q></p>

<p><q>Right you are, sir,</q> rejoined the man, with a sly
look at Violetta, as much as to say, <q>You're the cause
of this slow going.</q></p>

<p>They did not arrive at Guildford until five. They
put up at the Angel. Violetta had a cup of tea, and
Norman ordered dinner for half past six. Meanwhile,
they strolled about the interesting old town. They
were the best of friends and, as Norman thought, in a
fair way of becoming chums.</p>

<p>Most of Norman's lady friends at Normanhurst were
of the conventional type. Those at Thames-side,
when they were not conventional were slightly vulgar
and decidedly commonplace. They seemed to exude
wealth in their display of jewellery, and were of the sort
who in London appear to live at restaurants. Dinners
and lunches were to them the most important functions
of the day, and auction bridge at night. Violetta
on the other hand was wholly unconventional. She
had moved about in the world and had been observant
of things, and had her own opinion on them. Never
had Norman passed a more enjoyable day. Violetta
had completely chased away his gloom of the morning.</p>

<p>But as night approached he became a little fidgety.
He invented all manner of excuses for delay, and Violetta
acquiesced. A motor ride by moonlight promised
enjoyment and novelty. It was a goodish stretch
from Guildford to Thames-side, and as the chauffeur
had to stop several times--generally at hostelries, to
<pb n="95"/>
enquire the way--the car did not arrive at the Willows
until half past ten.</p>

<p>The house was lighted up, and the sounds of a piano
and singing were heard.</p>

<p><q>Beastly nuisance,</q> exclaimed Norman in a tone
of vexation. <q>I'd hoped the spiritualistic tomfoolry
was over. Ella seems to have turned it into a sing song.</q></p>

<p><q>Does it matter?</q> asked Violetta.</p>

<p><q>I don't know that it does. Still--well, we must
go through it, I suppose. But I hate the Thames-
side people.</q></p>

<p>He spoke in a kind of desperation and seemed to
regard the gathering much more seriously than it
warranted. So at least Violetta thought. But was
there any other reason?</p>

</div>



<div n="10" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter X</head>
<head type="main"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe</head>

<p>The song--of the inane sentimental revue type, in waltz
time, of course--was not finished, and Norman and
Violetta waited in the hall rather than interrupt it.
Violetta could have easily escaped to her room had
she chosen to do so, but she was filled with the spirit
of defiance. She knew perfectly well that Norman
would need an ally against Ella, certainly, if not against
some of the visitors. From what Norman had said
about them, she gathered that they were of the new
rich class, always ready to stand on what they called
their <soCalled>dignity</soCalled>--others might term it vulgarity--
and the absence of their host they might regard as a
great offence. Still, much might be forgiven a baronet.
No doubt Violetta would be looked upon as the chief
culprit, and she was ready to defend herself if need be.</p>

<pb n="96"/>
<p>She chanced to look at Norman. He had gone very
pale and he was gnawing his lower lip nervously. He
evidently dreaded the coming conflict. Violetta was
puzzled. It was unaccountable that he should be in
such terror of his sister.</p>

<p>The song ended in a prolonged note, loud and shrill,
and the accompanist's concluding chord was drowned
in uproarious applause. Norman still hung back.</p>

<p><q>We'd better face the situation,</q> whispered Violetta.
<q>We've got to do it some time, you know.</q></p>

<p>Her steady voice and her composed manner gave him
courage. They entered before the clamour died away.
Some of the audience were eager for an encore, which,
without a doubt, would have been granted, but for
the distraction caused by the unexpected appearance
of the two truants. Every eye was turned in their
direction, and Violetta did not fail to note the glare
of annoyance thrown at her by the vocalist.</p>

<p>Ella hastened to her brother. She looked un-
mistakably angry.</p>

<p><q>Don't make your apologies just yet, John,</q> she
whispered snappishly. <q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe is
going to sing again. So like you, to come at the wrong
moment.</q></p>

<p>Of Violetta she took not the slightest notice.</p>

<p>But <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe had no intention of
obliging again. She kept her stony stare fixed on
Violetta and then deliberately turned her back--there
was a good deal of the latter on view. She was a tall
fair woman, with a well-developed--almost <emph>too</emph> well-
developed--form, and she was undeniably handsome, but
of a type more fleshly than refined. Her complexion
was artistically laid on, and herein she showed discretion.
It was not overdone. Her age was probably not less
than thirty.</p>

<p>Violetta classed her at once. She had seen many
like her in Paris, on the race course, and at the Folies
Berg√®re. Her prototype was familiar at Monte Carlo.
<pb n="97"/>
These women were out to make money not by their wits
but by the exhibition of their charms. But anyone
less like the orthodox spiritualistic medium could
hardly be conceived. What was she doing in that
<foreign xml:lang="fr">gal√®re</foreign>? Violetta looked at her with considerable
curiosity and decided that her interest in the Norman
household was deepening.</p>

<p>Norman knew one or two of the visitors and greeted
them politely. Then Ella took him in charge and
introduced him to others, coming finally to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Wil-
loughby Smythe, who with her back still turned to the
company generally, was apparently absorbed in turning
over a pile of music.</p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe,</q> said Ella in her high-
pitched voice, <q>I want to introduce my brother to you.</q></p>

<p>The lady wheeled round slowly and fixed a somewhat
hard smile on Sir John. The latter bowed without
saying a word.</p>

<p><q>I shall leave him to make his excuses for missing your
striking demonstration of psychic power.</q></p>

<p>Ella swished away and the two were left together.
No one was very near, and the loud chatter effectually
masked their voices. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe waited
for Sir John to speak, and he had no alternative but
to begin.</p>

<p><q>What does your coming here mean?</q> he asked
coldly.</p>

<p><q>I wanted to see you again. I wanted your forgive-
ness. I know I behaved in a very silly fashion, and
you must have thought ever so many bad things about
me. But, as you must admit, I wasn't wholly to blame.</q></p>

<p><q>Is it worth while to go into the past?</q> said he.
<q>You took your own course and I suppose you acted
according to what you thought was right. I've nothing
to say. You can hardly expect me to forgive you.</q></p>

<p><q>Indeed I do. You <emph>must</emph>. Of course, we can't
discuss the matter here. I ask you--I entreat you to
meet me, I want to go into an explanation.</q></p>

<pb n="98"/>
<p><q>I'd rather not hear it. What would be the use?
It's all over between us.</q></p>

<p><q>Indeed it isn't. How can it be so? You know
better than that, John. Don't make an enemy of me.
I warn you.</q></p>

<p>Up to this point her voice, which was really musical,
was soft and wheedling. It now took on a harshness
of which one would hardly have suspected it was capable.</p>

<p><q>I don't desire that we should be enemies, though
I've ample cause to look upon you as anything but a
friend. Still &#x2026;</q></p>

<p><q>When will you meet me, and where?</q> she inter-
jected.</p>

<p><q>You'd better write what you wish to say. I don't
see that any good can come of a meeting.</q></p>

<p><q>Who's the girl you've been taking for a joy ride?</q>
she burst out with a quiver in her utterance which told
of passion raging within her.</p>

<p><q>She's a friend of my sister's, but it's no affair of
yours.</q></p>

<p><q>That's where you make a mistake. It <emph>is</emph> my affair,
and you know it.</q></p>

<p><q>I know nothing of the kind. Of all people in the
world, you've the least right to criticise what I choose
to do.</q></p>

<p>She laughed scornfully.</p>

<p><q>We'll see about that later on. Don't forget that
I can if I choose throw a bombshell into this room
that you wouldn't find very pleasant.</q></p>

<p><q>Nor would you. I can't imagine you making such
a fool of yourself, Christine.</q></p>

<p>The lady's eyes were blazing in the effort to control
herself, and she compressed her lips until they were
little more than a thin white line. She had evidently
taken his words to heart. John Norman had un-
expectedly shown fight. It was his way. He was not
wanting in courage, but it had to be roused by real
danger. He was at his best when in a hot corner.</p>

<pb n="99"/>
<p><q>We'll defer the argument, but all the same it'll
have to be thrashed out.</q></p>

<p><q>As you please. For to-night I take it we've said
enough.</q></p>

<p>He bowed coldly and turned away. He was only
just in time. One of the women whom he knew had
drawn near them and had they continued the alter-
cation she must have overheard their words, for do
what they would they could not help raising their
voices.</p>

<p><q>Has <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe been telling the
wonderful things she said about you in her message
from the other world?</q> asked the new comer.</p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe has revealed nothing,</q>
returned Norman, with a significant glance at the
<soCalled>medium.</soCalled></p>

<p><q>I never remember what I say under the influence.
It all goes when the spirit no longer desires to make
use of me.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe had a voice and manner
at her command which she employed when speaking
of the spirit world, and she became preternaturally
solemn and deliberate. She had discovered that non-
sense uttered in an impressive tone generally went
down as truth. With spiritualism personal conviction
is everything.</p>

<p><q>Is that really so? Well, that makes it all the more
wonderful. Then you must get your sister, Sir John,
to tell you. She says that if <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe
had known you all your life she could not have been
more accurate. I understood from Miss Norman that
you and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Smythe were perfect strangers.</q></p>

<p><q>Quite true, Miss Alison,</q> rejoined Norman, with
another challenging glance at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe,
who remained silent.</p>

<p><q>I do hope you'll give us another manifestation soon,
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Smythe. You won't be leaving Thames-side
yet awhile, will you?</q> went on Miss Alison.</p>

<pb n="100"/>
<p><q>I don't know. I haven't made any plans. I'm
wanted very much in London.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh you must be. Spiritualism is <emph>so</emph> interesting
whether you believe in it or not. Good-bye. I trust
we shall be meeting again before long. Good-bye,
Sir John. The next time we have a s√©ance you really
must come.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm a sceptic. I'm afraid my presence would act as
a deterrent.</q></p>

<p><q>You don't know until you try. I've heard of
pronounced sceptics being convinced against their
wills and becoming fervent believers. It might be
so in your case, Sir John.</q></p>

<p><q>It might,</q> echoed Norman. <q>Anyhow, I'm con-
tented as I am.</q></p>

<p>He shot the words at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe as he
turned aside to shake hands with another departing
guest.</p>

<p>The evening was at an end. The end had come about
sooner than was expected. Somehow the arrival of
Norman and Violetta had broken into the enjoyment
and the interruption could not be bridged over. Ella
had not anticipated anything would follow the s√©ance,
but a reaction had set in after an hour's enforced silence
in a darkened room, and music was welcomed.</p>

<p>Violetta was not averse to the exodus. Ella had
<choice><corr>behaved</corr><orig>hehaved</orig></choice> very rudely towards her and had not spoken.
She was being cut severely, but she did not show the
least resentment. She could have slipped away without
being noticed, but she never moved. She was deter-
mined to sit through the drama which was going on
at the other end of the room. Not a single word could,
of course, be heard, but the faces of Sir John and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Willoughby Smythe told her they were not indulging
in commonplaces.</p>

<p>Violetta had not removed her outdoor costume, but
she was in keeping with others in the room. The party
was quite an informal one, and only <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby
<pb n="101"/>
Smythe in her capacity as medium was hatless. On
the whole Violetta was satisfied with her appearance
and was perfectly conscious that the sober simplicity
of her attire was in effective contrast with the over-
gowned and over-jewelled women. Quite at home,
she chatted easily with her nearest neighbour, hoping
to annoy Ella by her indifference to the slight sought
to be put upon her.</p>

<p>But when the last visitor had departed she prepared
herself for the fray. She made up her mind she would
have no assistance from Sir John who, with a cigarette
between his lips, was walking restlessly about the
room, but this did not matter. She could always
fight for herself.</p>

<p>Ella came up to her boiling with emotional rage.
She could only control herself sufficiently to ejaculate
one word which escaped her like a pellet from a pop-
gun.</p>

<p><q>Well!</q></p>

<p><q>Well--what?</q> was Violetta's retort.</p>

<p><q>What? What explanation have you to offer
of your extraordinary conduct?</q></p>

<p><q>Extraordinary conduct? Please, Ella, spare me.
I never was good at guessing riddles.</q></p>

<p><q>No? Well, I think I can guess yours. I call it
most disgraceful.</q></p>

<p><q>Call what most disgraceful?</q></p>

<p><q>Your motoring about all day with John and re-
turning at this time of night.</q></p>

<p>Norman interposed.</p>

<p><q>Come, now, Ella, be fair. What has Violetta----?</q></p>

<p><q>Violetta? I suppose you mean Miss Vaughan.</q></p>

<p><q>I said Violetta, and I mean Violetta. If you're
going to work yourself into a passion over anybody,
please select me. I'm used to your hysterical out-
bursts, she's not. If there's any blame--which I
flatly deny--I'll take it. But, good Heavens, do you
suppose I'm to be talked to as though I were a school
<pb n="102"/>
boy? Don't answer, Violetta. There's nothing for
you to answer.</q></p>

<p>Norman's sudden show of spirit both surprised and
pleased Violetta.</p>

<p><q>I quite agree with you, Sir John,</q> said she.</p>

<p><q>Sir John? Why not John--or <emph>dear</emph> John. I've
no doubt it was <emph>dear</emph> John and <emph>dear</emph> Violetta on your
joy ride.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, you're simply impossible,</q> cried Norman,
waving his hand at Violetta to signal her to keep <choice><corr>silence</corr><orig>sillence</orig></choice>
though he need not have troubled himself. She was
quite contented to shrug her shoulders and allow him
to carry on the contest single handed. She was curious
to see whether he would hold his own.</p>

<p><q>Impossible, am I? Then what are you? The
story will be common talk all over the place to-morrow.
There's nothing the people down here like better than
scandal. I begin to think there's a good deal of truth
in what <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe said while she was
in a trance.</q></p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe in a trance! That's too
funny. But I'll have no more of this nonsense. It's
absolutely silly. I apologise to you, Violetta. I'm
sorry my sister has made such an exhibition of herself.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm sorry too, but it's not of the least consequence
excepting that I regret I've been the cause of so much
trouble between you. However, I can easily put an
end to it. To-morrow morning I return to London.</q></p>

<p><q>I should think so, indeed,</q> almost shrieked Ella,
who was not to be appeased while her nerves were in
tumult.</p>

<p><q>I wish you good-night, Sir John, and thank you--
not only for the ride but for what you've said just now
in my behalf.</q></p>

<p>Violetta did not show the least discomposure. Nor-
man, anticipating her, moved swiftly to the door, opened
it for her, and held out his hand as she passed.</p>

<p><q>You're quite right to leave the house, but it's not
<pb n="103"/>
going to mean a parting between us,</q> said he in a low
voice.</p>

<p><q>I don't see why it should. Good-night once more.</q></p>

<p>Then she vanished. She had caught sight of Ella's
face white with fury. But for this she did not care a
button. She had roused Norman's latent energy, and
this was everything.</p>

<p><q>I've always said you were a fool where women
were, John,</q> burst out his sister. <q>If I'd thought
Violetta's object in coming here was to make love to
you I'd never have invited her. Yet I might have
known what would happen. At school she was always
getting other girls into scrapes and escaping blame
herself.</q></p>

<p><q>Look here, Ella, I'm not in the mood to quarrel
with you, either about Violetta or anybody else. Good-
night.</q></p>

<p>He walked off to Ella's intense disgust. She had
worked herself into a volcano of rage and was eager to
vent it upon her brother. But it would keep. She
had seen John many a time before slip out of a wrangle
by a judicious retirement. It was his way of admitting
his defeat. She could not believe that his precipitous
retreat meant any more than his usual flight.</p>

<p>The next morning Violetta was up betimes. She
always got on well with servants as she never assumed
airs and was generous with her tips. She easily per-
suaded a housemaid to go out and arrange for a taxi
to come for her and her luggage. She refused breakfast
and accepted only a cup of tea. She was anxious to
get away as soon as possible, and so avoid an encounter
with Ella, which would have been an unprofitable
waste of time. As for Sir John well, she didn't par-
ticularly want to see him. She was still in the same
mind about renting the Owl's Nest, but he had given
her the name and address of his solicitor, and she could
easily arrange the matter through the lawyer.</p>

<p>No one was in the dining-room when she went in.
<pb n="104"/>
The cook was scandalised at the idea of so nice a young
lady going away breakfastless, and on her own re-
sponsibility had added an egg and bread and butter
to the cup of tea. She was indifferent to what her
mistress would say, but there was little risk of her
knowing anything about it, as after one of her outbursts
of nerves Ella usually remained in bed half the next day.</p>

<p>Violetta swallowed the meal hastily lest Norman
should come in and delay her. The early morning
is always an unfavourable time for discussing em-
barrassing questions. One is rarely strung up to the
proper pitch, and she was thankful he did not make his
appearance.</p>

<p>Before nine o'clock she was at the station, where she
found she had half an hour to wait for the train.</p>

<p>For ten minutes or so she walked up and down the
platform and was about to sit down when she saw
Norman emerge from the booking office and look about
him. Directly he caught sight of her he came forward
rapidly.</p>

<p><q>By Jove,</q> he exclaimed, raising his hat, <q>you
flitted away like a ghost. You hadn't been gone a
minute before I came down. I wanted to have a word
with you. I didn't think you would be off so early.
You needn't have been in such a hurry. Still, I'd
rather talk with you here than in the house. Whether
sleeping or waking, Ella's spirit somehow is always
pervading the place. What did you think of the un-
pleasantness last night?</q></p>

<p><q>I've forgotten all about it. On the whole, it was
rather amusing. You see, I knew Ella of old. Perhaps
it was as well we came to grips at an early stage. We
were bound to have a row sooner or later.</q></p>

<p><q>Yet knowing this you ventured to come.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I ventured to come.</q></p>

<p><q>Why on earth did you?</q></p>

<p><q>I had so pleasant a recollection of my stay at
Normanhurst I was tempted to repeat the pleasure. Of
<pb n="105"/>
course, I hadn't the slightest idea things had so changed.
Your losses don't seem to have affected you so much
as they have Ella. She has become frightfully tetchy,
and much more difficult to deal with than she used
to be.</q></p>

<p><q>Beastly difficult. I wish to goodness she'd marry
the young fool she's engaged to, and let me run alone.
But</q>--his manner had become a little hesitating--
<q>when I asked you what you thought of last night
I hadn't Ella in my mind. Like the poor, she's always
with us, and I don't believe she'll ever alter. What
I wanted to know was your opinion of--of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Wil-
loughby Smythe?</q></p>

<p><q>Does my opinion matter?</q></p>

<p><q>It matters very much--to me. You strike me
as so level headed, Violetta, that I feel almost inclined
to----</q> he broke off, reddening. <q>Yes, I want your
opinion of her--candidly.</q></p>

<p><q>What one woman thinks of another is bound to be
prejudiced and possibly unfair.</q></p>

<p><q>But often bitterly true.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, as I presume what I think can be of no con-
sequence to you one way or the other, I'll venture to
speak my mind. I don't know, of course, anything about
her as a spiritualistic medium--she may be genuine,
she may be a fraud--but in other respects--by the way,
are you interested in her?</q></p>

<p><q>In a fashion I suppose I am.</q></p>

<p><q>Then please let me off saying anything more. I'd
rather not.</q></p>

<p><q>But you must. I've my reasons for asking.</q></p>

<p>At that moment the screech of an engine was heard.
The London train was approaching.</p>

<p><q>I can only look upon her in the light in which one
woman always regards another, though perhaps she
won't confess it. I should say to a man who was
thinking of marrying her, remember Punch's advice--
don't.</q></p>

<pb n="106"/>
<p>Norman did not at once reply. His expression was
sombre; his eyes fixed on space. A second screech
from the nearing engine recalled his wandering senses.</p>

<p><q>Advice which generally comes too late to be of any
good,</q> said he. <q>You may be right about <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Willoughby Smythe. She has the reputation of being
a reckless gambler and can never resist betting on horses.
She is of a class whom I've come to detest.</q></p>

<p><q>Then you know her?</q></p>

<p><q>No one better. She happens to be my wife! There,
it's out. I wanted to tell you but I hadn't the pluck.
Good-bye. Are you still fixed on taking the Owl's
Nest?</q></p>

<p>Violetta stood mute. The unexpected confession
had paralysed her. Before she had recovered herself
the train was slowing down at the platform. There
was no time to express astonishment or sympathy--if
sympathy was required. All she could do was to
reply to his question.</p>

<p><q>Yes</q>--she forced herself to say--<q>I shall call
on your lawyer as soon as I get back to town.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm glad--I'm awfully glad. I don't want to
lose sight of you. I won't. Good-bye--and good
luck.</q></p>

<p>The next minute she was in the carriage and the
train bore her away. Norman, hat in hand, waved her
a farewell.</p>

<div n="11" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XI</head>
<head type="main">Peter Gumley, the Trainer</head>

<p>A pleasant undulating bit of country is that part of
Sussex known as Holberry Down. Long stretches of
fine turf on a chalk bottom alternate with sweet smelling
pines and firs, which flourish healthily on the strips
<pb n="107"/>
of sandy soil to be found, by some odd geological freak,
stuck here and there among the chalk. As fine a place
for a morning gallop as one could find in all England,
and no wonder that experienced judge of horseflesh
Peter Gumley, selected it as an ideal place for a training-
stable.</p>

<p>Peter Gumley was a man who had been used to
horses ever since he had been out of the cradle. He
was quite sixty years of age, but looked no more than
forty, thanks to his early hours at night, his equally
early hours in the morning, and his regular and ab-
stemious life.</p>

<p>He was stoutly built, slightly bowed about the legs,
as most horsey men are, and with a quiet resolute face.
His hair was closely cut, and of a gingery hue, and he
had a slight fringe of whiskers, corresponding in colour
to his hair, on the edge of each cheek. He always
dressed very quietly, generally in a tweed suit of a sort
of snuff tint, and wore a white pique scarf with a
big diamond pin--the gift of some grateful patron--
blazing in the centre.</p>

<p>Just now there was an irritable expression on his rosy
gills as he walked from the big stable yard into the neat
garden which surrounded his house, a plain, square,
uncompromising sort of building, dull brick with a
door in the centre, a window each side and three windows
upstairs.</p>

<p>The house had originally belonged to a farmer, and
was even uglier than it was now, for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley
Peter's wife, having a fancy for flowers, had trained a
wisteria, a passion flower and a clematis over the front,
and this side of the building, at all events, was pleasant
to the eye.</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley herself was standing within a little
latticed porch, which projected about a foot from the
door, and watched her husband enter the garden and
walk towards her down a neatly trimmed box-edge
path.</p>

<pb n="108"/>
<p><q>Well, Peter,</q> said she, enquiringly.</p>

<p><q>I'll have no more of it. I've given him a clout on
the ear and sent him packing.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, Peter, the best rider in the stable!</q></p>

<p><q>And the worst boy--the worst every way 'cepting
when his legs are across the saddle.</q></p>

<p><q>I suppose it could not be helped,</q> said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley,
regretfully. She was a buxom, good-natured dame,
with rather a soft heart, and was at least ten years
younger than her husband.</p>

<p><q>Be helped! Of course it can't! Look here, Mary,
this is the third time that boy has got drunk, and his
sixteenth birthday only last week.</q></p>

<p><q> I know he's a little weak-minded, but I'd ha' given
him another chance if I'd been you.</q></p>

<p><q>Chances!</q> exclaimed the trainer irritably. <q>He's
had more chances than any boy I've ever had in the
stables. And as for his being weak-minded, why,
that only makes the thing worse. What's to prevent
him being laid hold of by any of the scheming black-
guards who are always on the look-out for a <q>weak-
minded</q> boy, and selling us? A boy who begins by
drinking 'll end in hocussing.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, Peter! I'm sure Tim would never do such a
dreadful thing!</q> returned <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley, looking scared.</p>

<p>To her <q>hocussing</q> a racehorse was worse than
burglary, forgery, or arson. It ranked next to wilful
murder.</p>

<p><q>Well, I hope not; but see here--who do you think
give him the drink?</q></p>

<p><q>Law me! how should I know?</q></p>

<p><q>Barney Moss, that Jew chap, who's been stopping
at the <q>Barley Mow</q> for the past fortnight, and whom
I've seen hanging round the stables no end of times.
He's here for no good, Mary.</q></p>

<p><q>That's true. Well, I'm sorry for Tim Hollis. Such
a nice looking boy, too!</q></p>

<p><q>He's got a bad strain in him, take my word for
<pb n="109"/>
it. Anyhow, he's gone, and on the whole I think the
place is well rid of him.</q></p>

<p>And Peter Gumley stepped into the house and sat
down in the cool little sitting-room, where he took
off his hat and mopped his heated brow with a blue
bordered handkerchief.</p>

<p>It wasn't often that Peter Gumley allowed himself
to be so excited. To tell the truth, he had a sort of
sneaking liking for the erring Tim Hollis, and it put
him out terribly that the lad should have gone wrong.
But his duty was clear before him. Splendid rider as the
boy was, and fully acquainted as he might be with all
the ins and outs of the string of colts at present lodged
at Holberry Down Farm, it was not safe to keep him,
and go he must.</p>

<p>And go he did, and there he was, with a slouching
gait, in a dusty road that crossed the Downs into Norman-
hurst village, leaving so far as he knew Holberry Down
for ever.</p>

<p>He was rather a sturdy lad for a stable-boy, who is
generally undersized and wizened looking. He had
ruddy cheeks and a thick shock head of red hair. He
was, as <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley had said, a nice looking boy,
but to a judge of character the face was spoilt by a weak
mouth and chin, and somewhat heavy brows. The
features, indeed, were contradictory. They betokened
a mixture of obstinacy and irresolution. Tim Hollis's
life depended upon the people he associated with, and
upon those who had an influence over him for good
or for evil.</p>

<p>Just now he had a sullen look upon his face, and as
he moved slowly along, almost dragging one foot after
the other in the thick dust, his hands in his pockets,
and chewing a straw between his teeth, even good
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley must have admitted there were few signs
of penitence and remorse about him.</p>

<p>It did not much matter where he went. He knew
he should find occupation wherever horses were, and
<pb n="110"/>
so he did not trouble. Indeed, his mind was occupied
with thoughts of revenge, and when this feeling takes
possession of one there is not much room for anything
else.</p>

<p><q>Peter Gumley might have treated me better, con-
sidering what I know. But then, Gumley doesn't know
what I know. He'd have done differently if he had;
that cuff of the head what he give me stopped my mouth.
I'd ha' told him why Barney Moss made me tipsy
last night, if he'd spoke to me fair. Now I shan't.</q></p>

<p>Tim Hollis strode on moodily, and the straw in his
mouth became shorter as he nibbled bits and spat them
out of his mouth.</p>

<p>Another quarter of a mile and he would be on the
top of the downs and be looking over Normanhurst.</p>

<p>The downs rose by a very gentle inclination, but the
gradient of the old road years ago had been found too
steep for carriage traffic, and so a road had been cut
skirting the acclivity, and thus securing a fairly level
piece of driving.</p>

<p>Just where the fork of the upper and lower road
was situated, there was a grassy bank at the foot of
which bubbled a spring of clear water. It had been cut
into when the lower road was made, and there it was,
sending up hundreds of gallons a day which were running
to waste.</p>

<p>Tim was thirsty. He laid himself down on his
stomach, dipped his face in the bubbling spring, and
lapped the water like a dog. When he was satisfied
and had withdrawn his dripping face he saw a young
lady standing near watching him. She was nice to look
upon Tim at once decided, with her grey tailor made
costume, its short skirt revealing her leather gaiters,
and her masculine collar and flowing scarf, and as a
well brought up lad used to the fine ladies who crowded
the racecourse enclosures, lie sprang to his feet and
bowed politely. The lady smiled in acknowledgment.</p>

<p><q>You drank the water as if you enjoyed it,</q> said she.</p>

<pb n="111"/>
<p><q>It's all right so fur as water <emph>can</emph> be right. I guess
I shan't have a chance of anything else for a goodish
time.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh?</q></p>

<p><q>Down on my luck, miss. I suppose you don't
know of a job going anywhere?</q></p>

<p><q>What kind of job?</q></p>

<p><q>Anything to do with 'orses, don't matter what.</q></p>

<p><q>You're used to horses, are you?</q></p>

<p><q>Just a bit. Bin among 'em ever since I was a kid,
an' before that. I believe I was born in a stable.</q></p>

<p>The lady looked at the lad with increased interest.
She noted his old-looking, face, his long nose and his
thin lipped mouth. She knew the signs.</p>

<p><q>Where were you employed?</q></p>

<p><q>Up at old Peter Gumley's stables, Holberry Down,
across yonder. He gave me the push this morning.
The missus would ha' kept me on--she's one o' the
best when you know her--but the old man--no. So
he fired me.</q></p>

<p><q>What for?</q></p>

<p><q>I dunno. He hadn't got no fault with me as far
as my dooties went.</q></p>

<p><q>What did he find fault with, then?</q></p>

<p><q>Said I lifted my right 'and too often. P'raps you
don't know what that means, miss.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, yes I do. And was it true?</q></p>

<p><q>Once in a way maybe, but it warn't my fault.</q></p>

<p><q>I hope it wasn't. You're too young to begin
that kind of thing.</q></p>

<p>She looked at the lad keenly. He had not a vicious
face. Most likely it was as he said. It seemed a pity
he should be allowed to drift from bad to worse.</p>

<p><q>Look here, boy, I'm going to see <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley. Shall
I speak to him for you, and ask him to take you back?</q></p>

<p><q>Thank 'ee kindly Miss, but I'd rather you didn't.
I don't want to go back. It won't do me no good.</q></p>

<p><q>How's that?</q></p>

<pb n="112"/>
<p><q>'Cause it won't. I ain't sorry to get away. I'd
rather work for you, miss.</q></p>

<p><q>I can't give you a job that would suit you. I've
no horses.</q></p>

<p><q>There might be something else.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you know anything about gardening or poul-
try?</q></p>

<p><q>I guess I do. I'd like 'em for a change.</q></p>

<p><q>You wouldn't stay. Before long you'd want to go
where there are horses.</q></p>

<p><q>You might try me, miss.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I might do that, but I won't promise. Do
you know the Owl's Nest near Weltersfield?</q></p>

<p><q>Course I do, but there ain't anybody living there.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, yes there is. I am. Come this evening and
I'll see what I can do. Ask for Miss Vaughan. But
don't reckon upon anything for certain, mind.</q></p>

<p><q>Right y'are, miss.</q></p>

<p>The lad brightened visibly.</p>

<p><q>What are you going to do meanwhile?</q></p>

<p><q>Walk about I s'pose.</q></p>

<p><q>Got any money?</q></p>

<p><q>Stoney broke, miss.</q></p>

<p><q>I wonder whether you are,</q> thought Violetta.
<q>I'll chance it. I've been like that myself more than
once. It's not a nice sensation.</q></p>

<p>She gave him a shilling. Tim Hollis could hardly
believe his eyes. He spat upon it for luck.</p>

<p><q>You <emph>are</emph> a good sort, miss.</q></p>

<p>Violetta nodded and went on her way to Holberry
Down. She had been at the Owl's Nest now nearly a
month and had worked like a nigger in getting the place
in order. She'd not seen Norman nor heard from him
since leaving The Willows. There hadn't been the
slightest difficulty in dealing with his lawyer, and she
had taken the place for three years. She half expected
Norman would have written to her on the settlement
of the business, but he had not, and she concluded that
<pb n="113"/>
after his astounding admission about his marriage,
he did not care to do so.</p>

<p>Of her own feelings on the matter she would not allow
herself to think. Every day meant such strenuous
work that she always went to bed dog tired. She was
wholly absorbed in transforming the Owl's Nest ac-
cording to her own ideas, and with the assistance of
a country woman, strong as a horse, and an old man
who came in every day she wrought wonders. The
change from her indolent life of the past year to one
of intense activity suited her restless, energetic tem-
perament admirably and she wondered how she could
have endured frittering away her time at Monte Carlo.
Still, her stay there had ended advantageously. With-
out the ¬£250 from the stranger for whom she had acted
as a mascotte and whom she set down as a <q>bookie,</q>
she could not have started her enterprise at the Owl's
Nest.</p>

<p>What that enterprise was Violetta kept to herself, but
it certainly was not poultry farming. Her visit now
to Peter Gumley was to be the first step in the furtherance
of her plans.</p>

<p>She made her way to the square, unpretending house
of the trainer. It was surrounded by a well-kept
garden, and the whole was fenced off from the stables
and meadows. Any visitor to Peter Gumley who
imagined he would have an opportunity of seeing the
horses Peter had under his charge would have been
<choice><corr>grievously</corr><orig>greviously</orig></choice> disappointed. Moreover Peter had a
vigilant staff of stable helps part of whose duties it
was to keep pertinacious racing touts at bay.</p>

<p>Violetta knocked at the door. It was opened by
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley, who was evidently not disposed to make
herself agreeable until she was sure of her ground.</p>

<p><q>And what may you please want, miss?</q> said she,
after surveying Violetta up and down.</p>

<p><q>I want to see <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley.</q></p>

<p><q>Aye, an' what about may I ask? I daresay I can
<pb n="114"/>
manage your business. It's just the same whether
you talk to my husband or to me.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley's manner was not encouraging. Violetta
reckoned her up as an admirable lady Cerberus and
worth her weight in gold to Peter.</p>

<p><q>I'm sure it is,</q> said Violetta, sweetly. <q>I'm a
new neighbour of yours, but I hope I'm none the worse
for that.</q></p>

<p><q>A new neighbour? Yes, and what then?</q></p>

<p><q>My name's Vaughan. I'm living at the Owl's
Nest.</q></p>

<p><q>Be you? I did hear as Squire Norman had let the
place. So you're his tenant. I don't want to be
uncivil, but I can't see as your living at Owl's Nest
makes you any the more welcome. My husband and
Sir John bean't the best o' friends.</q></p>

<p><q>Is that so? I'm sorry. I feel I ought to apologise
for troubling you, but I'm rather interested in a lad
I met in the road just now. He told me he'd been in
your employ and had been dismissed, and he seemed
so downhearted that I was tempted to take him into
my service. Now could you recommend him?</q></p>

<p>This was not at all the business which had brought
Violetta to the house. She knew the secretive ways
of trainers, and saw in the boy an excuse for calling.
Otherwise her errand might have been fruitless. It
was a stroke of luck, for the mention of the lad awoke
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley's sympathies. She was heartily sorry
for him. For all that, she did not lose her caution.
After what her husband had hinted about the boy,
she was not eager to accept any responsibility. At
the same time, she was anxious to do him a good turn.</p>

<p><q>So far as I'm concerned, the boy's always behaved
nicely. I found him willing and obliging, but of late
he didn't get on well with the gov'nor. I'd rather
you talked to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley about him.</q></p>

<p>Violetta desired nothing better, but she showed no
eagerness. It was rather the other way about.</p>

<pb n="115"/>
<p><q>Certainly--if it's not taking up his time. Perhaps
he's busy.</q></p>

<p><q>There's always plenty to do here, but I'll see. Step
in, Miss Vaughan, and I'll see.</q></p>

<p>So Violetta followed the good lady into the neat
sitting-room, where everything was mathematically
arranged, even to the pictures of famous race horses
and jockeys and turf celebrities generally, on the walls.
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley dusted a chair, more from force of habit
than because it needed dusting, and left her visitor
to herself.</p>

<p>Peter Gumley came in. Violetta recognised him
at once. He was the man she had seen in the meadow
when Norman's car frightened the horses. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley
saluted his visitor with his forefinger to his forehead.</p>

<p><q>Mornin', young lady. My missus tells me as
you're thinking of engaging young Tim Hollis.</q></p>

<p><q>If that's the name of the lad, yes. Is he honest?</q></p>

<p><q>So fur as money goes, I b'lieve so. Not a bad chap
in some ways, but I'm afraid he's got into a queer set.
But if you don't run racehorses I guess that set won't
have much use for him. Mind you, it's only my sus-
picions. He drinks a bit, too, but he may give that up
if he once gets out with the lot that I'm afraid's got hold
of him.</q></p>

<p><q>But he knows horses?</q></p>

<p><q>Knows a lot. That's where the shame of it comes
in. He's got all the makings in him of a first-rate
jockey.</q></p>

<p><q>He might suit me, then. I think of buying a race
horse.</q></p>

<p>Peter Gumley stared at the young lady open-mouthed.</p>

<p><q>You do, miss? My word! What for?</q></p>

<p><q>To make money, of course.</q></p>

<p><q>You'll excuse me, but there's no <q>of course.</q>
You're just as likely to lose money as to make it. It
wants a lot o' capital. If you <emph>must</emph> go in for the turf,
you might back a horse so long as you don't risk much.</q></p>

<pb n="116"/>
<p><q>I'm not so sure. I've heard it said that it's safer
to bet on a horse you know something about than on
one about which you know nothing. That's why I
say I prefer to own my own racer.</q></p>

<p>Peter had nothing to say to this. He could only
stare again at the young woman who spoke so con-
fidently.</p>

<p><q>I wonder, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley, whether you knew my father,
Captain Vaughan. He opened a riding school near
Regents Park some eighteen years ago, and afterwards
ran a sporting club.</q></p>

<p><q>Captain Vaughan! What, are you Frank Vaughan's
little girl who used to ride a pony barebacked, when
little more than a toddler?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, though I don't remember you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't suppose you do. Well, let's shake hands
anyhow on the strength of it. And how's the dad?</q></p>

<p><q>My father's dead, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley. He was thrown
when riding in a steeplechase in France. I warned
him against the horse he was on, but it was no good.</q></p>

<p><q>I'll reckon it warn't. Frank Vaughan was bound
to have his way if he could get it. He was a rare plucked
'un at going over the sticks, but I told him again an'
again he'd do it once too often. Well, well. And so
you're going in for the gees, are you?</q></p>

<p><q>In a small way, yes. I haven't too much coin,
but I thought you might have a horse I could buy.
Did <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley tell you I'm renting the Owl's Nest at
Weltersfield?</q></p>

<p><q>Aye. It's not a lucky place--leastways, it brought
no luck to Sir John Norman.</q></p>

<p><q>He never lived there, I'm told, so I don't see what
it had to do with his bad luck.</q></p>

<p><q>P'raps not. Sir John's all right so long as he's not
allowed to choose his own friends. He seems bent
upon picking up all the rotten ones. It was over one
of 'em we fell out--George Godfree. He swore the
man was all right 'cause they were chums at Oxford.
<pb n="117"/>
I knew better, but he wouldn't believe me. As I
wouldn't work with Gentleman George Sir John took
his horses away from me, and came to grief.</q></p>

<p><q>I've heard about that. It was very silly of him.
If I had a string of racers, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley, you should
train every one.</q></p>

<p><q>Thankee, Miss Vaughan. I wish you <emph>had</emph> a string
of 'em.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, there might be one,</q> rejoined Violetta, in
her most seductive tone. <q>That is, if you've a horse
that the owner would sell.</q></p>

<p><q>What figure are you willing to go to--¬£1,000?</q></p>

<p><q>Good gracious, no. I'm not a millionaire--yet.
I can't afford more than ¬£100.</q></p>

<p><q>Blest if that ain't a woman all over. She asks for
impossibilities, and has a way of getting 'em, too!
You'd better have a look at my stables. If you're
as good a judge of horseflesh as you were a rider, you'll
pick out the best of the bunch. But it won't be a
deal at your price. I've nothing like that.</q></p>

<p><q>Never mind, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley. It'll be a treat to see
what you've got, all the same.</q></p>

<head type="main">Violetta, the Horse Tamer</head>

<p>Peter led the way through the house. The back door
opened upon the stable yard, spick and span, almost
painfully clean. He called to a groom and the man
walked behind his master and supplemented when
necessary the description given by Peter to the visitor
of the pedigree and capabilities of each horse.</p>

<p>Violetta was at once on good terms with the animals.
<pb n="118"/>
She patted and caressed them, gave them sugar and
allowed them to touch her with their noses and satisfy
themselves that she was really their friend. Violetta
knew well enough how important to horses is the sense
of smell.</p>

<p>But the question of buying one, the owner of which
might be willing to part with, was a different matter.
The lowest price was ¬£500 for a black mare, and Violetta
told Peter contemptuously she wouldn't have her at
a gift.</p>

<p><q>I dunno but what you're right,</q> said the trainer.
<q>She might be the mother of a good horse, but she's
no good herself. I'm <choice><corr>afeared</corr><orig>afeard</orig></choice>, Miss Violetta, we can't
strike a bargain.</q></p>

<p><q>I'll have to look out for a cab horse of good blood
and fast, but with a little vice which I should have to
cure him of,</q> returned Violetta jestingly.</p>

<p><q>I've heard of such wonders, but never see one.
Well, I suppose we'd better return to the house.</q></p>

<p><q>What's in that farther stable? Sounds like a
kicker.</q></p>

<p>At that moment came a violent thud against the
woodwork.</p>

<p><q>Kicker's right. He's a beast. Can't do nothing
with him. If I could there wouldn't be a horse in the
stables as 'ud beat him.</q></p>

<p><q>May I look at the brute?</q></p>

<p>The stable was the last of a series. The door was
the usual half one, and Violetta looked through the
upper open portion.</p>

<p><q>Don't go too near, Miss,</q> warned Peter. <q>There's
no knowing what he'll do when he's in a bad temper.
How's Belphegor been behaving this morning,
Simmons?</q></p>

<p><q>A bit ratty, sir. Misses the boy, I reckon.</q></p>

<p><q>That lad you think of taking on, Miss Vaughan, was
the only one in the place as could do anything with
him.</q></p>

<pb n="119"/>
<p><q>Really? What are you going to do now the boy's
gone?</q></p>

<p><q>That's a bit of a puzzle. He hasn't been rubbed
down since yesterday morning, has he, Simmons?</q></p>

<p><q>No, sir. Not any of us dursn't go nigh him.
Hasn't been out neither. We thought as there might
be a bother to get him in again. Sometimes he won't
look at his stable. Tim allays had to coax him and
sometimes it took him an hour.</q></p>

<p>Violetta stood silently watching the animal and
taking in his points. He was a light chestnut with
a white streak down his nose, a combination which
gave him a vicious aspect, which was probably added to
by the furtive look in his big eyes. He was not a
handsome horse, but was enormously developed in
all the muscles which make for speed and strength.</p>

<p><q>He ought to be a good stayer,</q> said Violetta.</p>

<p><q>That's right, miss; but who's to tell? He's never
yet been fully extended. We did have one trial with
young Hollis on his back, and none of the others had
a look in. Even then he didn't show what he could do
when put to it.</q></p>

<p>Belphegor clearly didn't like the little crowd staring
at him. His ears were laid back, and his fore feet firmly
planted. Then he gave an impatient stamp, pawed
the ground, two or three times and wheeled round with
a nervous switching of the tail.</p>

<p><q>Lend me your crop, Simmons,</q> said Violetta.</p>

<p>The groom was holding a hunting crop, which he
handed over hesitatingly and with a glance at the
trainer.</p>

<p><q>What are you going to do, Miss Vaughan?</q> cried
Peter, as Violetta laid her hand on the bolt of the half
door and shot it back.</p>

<p><q>Going into the stable,</q> said she, smilingly.</p>

<p><q>Not with my consent. I tell you straight you're
running a terrible risk. You don't know what the
beast is like.</q></p>

<pb n="120"/>
<p><q>Exactly. I want to satisfy myself. It's a woman's
nature to be curious.</q></p>

<p><q>That may be, and she sometimes suffers for it.
What about Bluebeard's wives?</q></p>

<p><q>Bluebeard's wives don't concern me. I'm nobody's
wife.</q></p>

<p>By this time the bolt was drawn back, and before
Peter Gumley could prevent her, she was a couple of
feet inside the stable. The trainer and the groom
were about to follow her, but Violetta imperiously
waved them back.</p>

<p><q>If you don't want me to come to harm you'll leave
me alone and stay outside.</q></p>

<p><q>Mercy on us, you don't seem to care,</q> cried the
trainer, adding to himself, <q>but she's right after all.
Well, well, good luck go with her.</q></p>

<p>So they waited wonderingly while Violetta advanced
another couple of paces, calling out softly to Simmons
as she did so to shut the door behind her and to keep
out of view. She strongly suspected that the horse
had his reasons for disliking the groom.</p>

<p>Violetta advanced no further, but stood still as a
statue while feeling in her pocket for sugar. She
knew quite well that whether with animals or birds
it is movement on the part of a human being which
startles them and excites their distrust. She had
tested the accuracy of this belief, so far as birds and
squirrels were concerned, many times in <choice><corr>Fontainebleu</corr><orig>Fontainbleu</orig></choice>
forest and in the woods at Nice.</p>

<p>Belphegor condescended to look at her. Neither his
demeanour nor his attitude was quite so hostile. He
stamped his foot once or twice, but he did not bring
his hoof down so savagely as before.</p>

<p><q>Come along, old chap</q> said Violetta, softly and
caressingly.</p>

<p>The horse was still suspicious, but he was, at the
same time, curious. He wanted to decide whether
she was a friend or an enemy. Had she moved, the
<pb n="121"/>
spell she had begun to exercise would have been broken.
She was in no hurry, and did not attempt to do more
than talk to the horse softly and soothingly. In about
a quarter of an hour Belphegor, his ears perfectly normal,
advanced slowly towards her. She waited quietly.
He rubbed his nose against her arm, and she patted
his neck and stroked his crest. It was a sort of massage
and evidently to Belphegor's taste.</p>

<p>Violetta did not believe in whispering some kind of
shibboleth in the horse's ear--a performance which
some horse trainers used to go through, but in which
there is really nothing, so far as the shibboleth is con-
cerned. She whispered, it is true, but what she said
was much the same as before, just a few petting words,
and she breathed in his nose. Then came the sugar.
This completed the conquest.</p>

<p>Just to show she had quite won the affections of
the horse, she went on to coax him into the stall to
which she had been told he had at times a strong
objection, and of which a proof was pretty plain in
the shattered boards on one side. This she effected
by rubbing his side and flank with the handle end of a
hunting crop. He moved under the feel and pressure
of the crop in the direction she wanted, and at length
she had the satisfaction of seeing him in his stall quite
quiet and contented. He even allowed her to tie him
up. Then she returned to the door, the horse looking
after her. The whole operation had occupied about
an hour.</p>

<p><q>By the lord, Miss Violetta, if you bean't a wonder,</q>
cried the trainer. <q>What do you think o' that,
Simmons?</q></p>

<p><q>I dunno what to think, master. If I hadn't seen
it I wouldn't ha' believed it. What about giving him
a rub down now he's in a good temper?</q></p>

<p><q>Don't do anything of the kind,</q> Violetta cut in
imperatively. <q>I wouldn't answer for his behaviour
with anybody but myself or with the lad you've got
<pb n="122"/>
rid of. Leave him alone for a bit. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley, I'd
like to have a talk with you about Belphegor.</q></p>

<p><q>It's just this,</q> said she, when they were alone.
<q>I've a fancy for buying that horse. He's no good
to the owner as he is. None of your men can be trusted
to touch him, and he's only eating his head off. What
do you think would be a fair sum?</q></p>

<p><q>I daresay I could get him for ¬£150.</q></p>

<p><q>Too much. A hundred's my figure.</q></p>

<p><q>An' he stood me in at ¬£550. Fact is, Miss Vaughan,
the brute's mine. He comes from a good stock--
Mountebank, out o' Cutty Sark, and I bought him
a thinking as I could break him in. An' so I should
ha' done if that urchin Tim hadn't played me false.
Tell ye what, miss, you shall have him for ¬£100 and
you give me 20 per cent, on all his winnings for the
next three years.</q></p>

<p><q>Done, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley. Draw out a little memorandum
and I'll take away Belphegor at once.</q></p>

<p><q>The devil you will. How are you going to do it?</q></p>

<p><q>On his back, of course.</q></p>

<p><q>Then I hope as your life's insured. I may tell
'ee it's all a job to saddle him.</q></p>

<p><q>I expect so. Anyhow, I'll tackle it.</q></p>

<p>Peter wrote out a memorandum of the sale and its
conditions. Violetta, who had made up her mind
that she was going to buy something and had come
prepared, gave him a cheque and the transaction was
completed.</p>

<p><q>Before we go any further, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley, just tell
me the real reason why you got rid of Tim Hollis and
what you mean by saying that he played you false?</q></p>

<p><q>On the strict <abbr>q.t.</abbr>, then, miss, I feel satisfied he's
been got at by a gang. Perhaps you don't know I've
the favourites for the Two Thou, and Derby in hand,
an' knowing what I do know, I've got to guard 'em
like the apple of my eye.</q></p>

<p><q>Who's the leader of the gang--George Godfree?</q></p>

<pb n="123"/>
<p><q>Aye. You've hit it fust go.</q></p>

<p><q>I've heard that Godfree was at the bottom of Sir
John Norman's losses. But wasn't there someone
else behind him?</q></p>

<p><q>That's so. You know a lot, so I may as well speak
out. The man who pulled the wires was Dan Westoby.
I don't 'xactly know the rights of the story, but it
seems as Sir John Norman and Westoby quarrelled,
years ago. Sir John got the best of it, whatever it was
and Westoby swore to get his own back an' I guess
he did it. It's him as owns Normanhurst now.</q></p>

<p><q>I understand,</q> said Violetta drily. <q>I'm glad
you've told me this. By the way, don't let anybody
know you've sold Belphegor to me. Just for the time
being I shall lie low and watch the horse. No one
will suspect what I'm doing at the Owl's Nest. It's
about the last place in the world, I suppose, where one
would train a racer.</q></p>

<p><q>You're right there. You may trust me and Simmons
too. You've made up your mind then to take on
young Tim?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. I can't do without him. What about saddling
Belphegor?</q></p>

<p><q>You'd better have a snack o' lunch first. It may
take you an hour or more to saddle him, and you'll
want summat to work on.</q></p>

<p>Violetta agreed that the idea wasn't a bad one, and
shortly after she was sitting down with the trainer
and his wife before a cold Surrey chicken and a prime
Yorkshire ham. When the meal was finished, she
went back with Peter to the stables. She stipulated
that she was to be left to herself, and the trainer agreed.
He brought her a side saddle at which she laughed.</p>

<p><q>That's no good. I wouldn't trust myself in a
woman's saddle on the back of a horse like Belphegor.</q></p>

<p><q>What! D'ye want a man's saddle?</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly. Haven't I dressed myself for the part?</q></p>

<p>Peter Gumley was a little old-fashioned in his notions.
<pb n="124"/>
He knew perfectly well that riding straddle-legged was
coming into favour with horsewomen, but he did not
countenance it. However, he was not going to con-
tradict Violetta, who he could see was bound to do
as she liked, and with a shake of the head he brought
her a man's saddle, with which she went into the stable.</p>

<p>Belphegor looked round at the sound of the door
opening, and at first showed signs of uneasiness, but
he must have recognised Violetta, for he let her come
quite close to him. She patted and rubbed his neck
and let him see the saddle and touch it with his nose
and smell it. She was not in the slightest hurry, and
every step to familiarise the animal with the saddle
was done with the greatest deliberation. Then she
patted his back, and in a way went through a form
of massage just where the saddle would rest, and in
due time when she judged the opportunity had come
she gently placed the saddle upon him. He did not
show the slightest objection, and cautiously she fastened
and tightened the girth but only by degrees.</p>

<p>Saddling had to be followed by putting on the bridle,
and this also was done without much trouble. The
next thing was to get the horse accustomed to the new
feeling, and with her arm resting on the saddle she
walked him slowly about the stable. It was over an
hour before she was sufficiently satisfied it was safe to
mount him, and the stable being of considerable height,
she was able to do this inside.</p>

<p>Then she called out to Peter to open the door, and
she rode out looking as gallant a horsewoman as one
could wish to see. The trainer was forced to express
his admiration.</p>

<p><q>But lor, miss, there's some o' you women as looks
a picture, no matter what you do or wear, and I'm
danged if you're not one of 'em.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley. You'll let me come
and see you again, won't you?</q></p>

<p><q>Whenever you like, Miss Violetta. You'll always
<pb n="125"/>
be welcome. Besides, I shall be anxious to know how
Belphegor's behaving. If you goes on with him as
you've begun, I may make a bit of money. Who
knows?</q></p>

<p><q>I hope so. But you'll have to come to the Owl's
Nest. I shall want to consult you.</q></p>

<p><q>Right y'are. Only too pleased.</q></p>

<p>Violetta raised the whip she had borrowed in token
of farewell, and rode away at a gentle canter. The
horse moved with a delightfully easy free action, and
she could even fancy that he was pleased to get away
from the trainer's quarters. It was probable this was
so, for Violetta learned afterwards that nearly all the
men at the stables had had a go at taming Belphegor,
and the notions of the majority were based on cruelty
and fatigue to break the horse's spirit. These attempts
had been hopeless failures.</p>

<p>The journey to the Owl's Nest, not excepting the
broken winding ascending road to the house, was covered
without any mishap. The way was lonely, and out
of the beaten track, and nothing like a car or a motor
cycle was encountered. Despite her success, Violetta
was glad when she had Belphegor safely in the stable
she had had prepared for her first purchase. The horse
was still highly nervous, and she wanted him to get
thoroughly used to her before she would trust him
anywhere.</p>

<p>Violetta had a long rest, for her work with Belphegor
had been very exhausting. She was lying down in the
evening thinking over things when <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles, the
brawny poultry maid, housemaid and cook, and <q>general
utility</q> domestic announced the arrival of a lad.</p>

<p><q>Says, miss, as you told him to call.</q></p>

<p><q>Quite right, Stubbles. Show him in here.</q></p>

<p>Directly she was alone, Violetta rose and placed a
chair near the standard floor lamp, so that the light
from the latter should fall upon it, and resumed her
recumbent position on the couch.</p>

<pb n="126"/>
<p>Tim Hollis shuffled into the room in a shy, shambling
fashion, and stood awkwardly, cap in hand, his eyes
lost in wonder at the vision of beauty on the couch.
He hadn't ceased to think about her ever since she
spoke to him in the road. Provokingly charming as
she was in her semi-masculine attire, she was still more
so, though in a different way, now that she had gone
back to her woman's dress.</p>

<p>It amused Violetta and flattered her to see the lad's
confusion.</p>

<p><q>Sit down, Tim,</q> said she, pointing to the chair
under the lamp.</p>

<p>He obeyed, his freckled face reddening to the roots
of his hair. Where he was sitting she could study his
expression and tell whether he was speaking the truth.</p>

<p><q>What have you been doing since I saw you?</q>
said she.</p>

<p><q>Nothing, miss.</q></p>

<p><q>That's no answer. How have you been passing
the time?</q></p>

<p><q>Walking about over the downs.</q></p>

<p><q>Have you come across any of your friends--I don't
mean any of Gumley's men. Friends from London.
Do you understand?</q></p>

<p>Tim <emph>did</emph> understand. He saw that the beautiful
lady knew something and was not to be taken in. His
colour fled, and he fingered the buttons on his jacket
nervously.</p>

<p><q>I ain't got any friends in London,</q> he mumbled.</p>

<p><q>Look here, Tim, whether I take you on depends
upon you speaking the truth.</q></p>

<p><q>It <emph>is</emph> the truth, miss, I'm a telling you, s'elp me.
I <emph>do</emph> know one or two chaps as live in London, but I
don't call 'em friends.</q></p>

<p><q>They've given you money, haven't they?</q></p>

<p><q>Just a bob or two.</q></p>

<p><q>What for?</q></p>

<p><q>Only for talking a bit.</q></p>

<pb n="127"/>
<p><q>About Peter Gumley's horses?</q></p>

<p><q>They was allays asking questions an' a bothering
me.</q></p>

<p><q>You needn't have answered. You could have
told them to go to Jericho. Why did you give away
your master's secrets? It wasn't playing the game.</q></p>

<p><q>I know it warn't. Anyhow, I didn't tell 'em much.</q></p>

<p><q>You oughtn't to have told anything. What was
your grudge against Mr Gumley?</q></p>

<p>Tim did not answer for a few seconds. Then he burst
out:</p>

<p><q>He wouldn't let me have a chance with Belphegor.
I told him as the horse was the best two-year-old going,
but he wouldn't trust me on him. He put Jack Parsons
up once and Jack was throwed like a shuttlecock and
broke his leg, and Jack's the best rider in the stables.
For all that, Jack rode him at the <abbr>A.P.</abbr> Spring Meeting
an' nigh pulled it off. I love that horse, miss. We're
like two pals, an' I wanted him at the top of the tree.
When I see as Peter was dead set against him I s'pose
I did have a drop now and again, an' it was then that
Barney Moss got at me. You can't drink for nothing
nowadays. P'raps Peter didn't tell you as he give me
the sack about two months ago and took me on again?</q></p>

<p><q>No, he didn't. How was that?</q></p>

<p><q>It was this way. I'd been a lifting the right arm
too much--was a bit boozed, you know--an' he said
he'd have no more of it an' off I went. Well, I got
worritted over Belphegor. I knew as he wouldn't get
his food property. None of the others durst go nigh
him, and so the next night I climbs over the fence to
look after him. He knowed me fast enough, and he
made a noise that woke up Simmons and afore I could
do a bunk I was collared, an'--what d'ye think?--
accused of burgling!</q></p>

<p><q>But surely you explained why were you in the
stables?</q></p>

<p><q>Ra-<emph>ther</emph>. Then Simmons, as hates me like pi-son,
<pb n="128"/>
shifted his ground. He swore that if it wasn't burglary
I was getting at it was something worse--tampering
with some of the horses. Old Peter wouldn't believe
it, of me, and when the missus stuck up for me and said
I'd done the right thing by Belphegor, he took me back.
But the rest of the stable was all against me. Things
went from bad to worse, and then I got kicked out for
good. I don't care so much about that. What's
bothering me is what'll become of Belphegor.</q></p>

<p><q>I think I can help you there, Tim,</q> said Violetta,
rising from the couch. <q>Come with me.</q></p>

<p>She was fully convinced that Tim had spoken the
truth, and she came to the conclusion that it was a
wonderful stroke of luck which had caused her to en-
counter him at the right moment.</p>

<p>Leading the way to the outbuildings she unhooked
a lantern, lighted it, and softly opened the stable door.</p>

<p>No sooner did Tim set eyes on the horse than he shook
from head to foot.</p>

<p><q>T'aint him,</q> Violetta heard him mutter. <q>Can't
be. Yet t'aint his ghost either. I dunno----</q></p>

<p>Belphegor had turned his head and had made a little
snorting sound that Tim knew well enough. The next
moment he was by the horse, his arms round its neck
and Belphegor was rubbing his nose against the lad's
sleeve.</p>

<p>Violetta never uttered a word. She understood Tim's
feelings and respected his emotion. Under similar
circumstances she would have acted in much the same
manner--shed a tear or two.</p>

<p><said>He knows me, he do. See, Miss?</said> burst out Tim.
<said>But it beats me to find him here.</said></p>

<p><q>I've bought Belphegor, Tim, and you can stay and
look after him so long as you behave yourself and are
true to me.</q></p>

<p><q>True to you, miss. I'd fight for you to the last
drop o' my blood,</q> said Tim, amid his blubbering.</p>

<p><q>That's enough, Tim, I believe you. After you've
<pb n="129"/>
said all you want to say to Belphegor go to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles.
She'll look after you and give you some supper. Be
nice to her. She's one of the best. Perhaps you'd like
to have a shake down in the stable along with your pet.</q></p>

<p><q>That I should, miss.</q></p>

<p><q>Good. Then you know what to do.</q></p>

<p>And Violetta tripped away, leaving Tim in a state of
mind best described by his not knowing whether he
was on his head or his heels.</p>

</div>


<div n="13" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XIII</head>
<head type="main"><q>I'm Your Wife, Jack</q></head>

<p>While Violetta was engrossed with her preparations
at the Owl's Nest Norman was eating his heart out over
his difficulties and chafing incessantly because he could
not see a way of escape.</p>

<p>Ella at times irritated him beyond endurance and
they were nearer bitter quarrels than they had been at
any time of their lives. When she was upset his sister
talked violently and at random, and when she criticised
Violetta, which she insisted upon doing, it was hard to
say whether she was pleased or annoyed at her visitor's
sudden departure. It seemed to Norman pretty certain
that friendship between the two women was at an end
and that there was little chance of a reconciliation.</p>

<p>But did this matter, seeing that he had bound himself
hand and foot by his fatal marriage with a woman of
doubtful reputation? Looking back he could not
explain to himself how he came to be so foolish. But a
student of human nature knowing the circumstances and
acquainted with Norman's temperament and the skilled
devices which Christine had at her command to attract
men, would have had no difficulty in solving the problem.
<pb n="130"/>
It was really a reaction from the enforced monotony of
years which had caused the poor man to shake off his
placid and uneventful country surroundings and plunge
into the feverish gaiety of smart society life in London.
This reaction had been brought about by the death of
his wife and the unaccustomed feeling of freedom which
had followed.</p>

<p>In nine cases out of ten the sowing of wild oats does
no lasting harm to a young man. They are generally
the effect of high spirits and exuberant vitality. In
youth everything in life is fresh and delightful, and
especially our follies. But in the thirties and forties
things are different. Women to middle-aged men are
not as they appear to men just past their adolescence.
Adonis in the insolence of his manhood will make love
to all women who come his way and throw them aside
with equal facility. And the marvel is that women
forgive his fickleness. But let him be past thirty. He
is less cruel and more constant than a young man; he
takes himself seriously and, what is worse, women take
<emph>him</emph> seriously. <q>He's old enough to know his own
mind,</q> is what they think, but is any man old enough
for this knowledge where a woman is concerned?</p>

<p>The tragic part of the business is that often times a
middle-aged man, after imagining his mind is made up
and finding he is mistaken, has not the courage to tell
the woman so, and he drifts into a position from which
he discovers it is impossible to extricate himself without
appearing wholly in the wrong and horribly unjust and
unfair to the wife.</p>

<p>It is not the depraved or dissipated who blunder in
this way, but the man of honour, the man of good
intentions, and Sir John Norman answered to both.
In addition, whether from lack of experience or from
his own nature, Norman always believed the best of
everyone. So when he ran across George Godfree he
was genuinely glad to see him and looked charitably on
the fact that Godfree had been sent down from his
<pb n="131"/>
college under decidedly discreditable circumstances. He
wasn't blind to Godfree's deterioration, but this made
him the more kindly disposed towards him. The last
thing he suspected was that the friend of his youth was
deliberately setting himself to work his ruin.</p>

<p>It was not that Godfree had any grudge against Nor-
man. Indeed, he would have preferred to <soCalled>operate</soCalled>
upon someone else, but the opportunity had come and
he justified his treachery by the argument that if he
didn't feather his nest by plucking Norman somebody
else would. Godfree, in truth, belonged to that variety
of rascal who cannot come into contact with anybody
with more money than he knows what to do with than he
schemes to get it. Godfree, like hosts of others more
or less connected with the turf, lived on the capture of
<soCalled>mugs.</soCalled> And he had not lunched and dined and gone
to night clubs of a more or less questionable character
with Norman half-a-dozen times before he decided that
his newly-found friend was a <soCalled>mug</soCalled> of the most
malleable type. Godfree had a soft job, and he made the
most of it with the aid of Christine Davenport, intro-
duced to Norman as a rich American widow. Her
wealth existed only in imagination, as Norman was
destined to discover.</p>

<p>It may at least be said in justice to Godfree that
Norman's marriage with Christine was not in his pro-
gramme. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Davenport, however, took the reins in
her own hands. Norman was dazzled, bewildered by
her fascinations, assisted by a round of riotous gaiety,
and woke up from his spell to find himself united to a
lady with expensive tastes and a mania for betting and
gambling, with no money of her own and bent only upon
spending her husband's. The result was inevitable.
When the crash came, and no more coin was forthcoming,
she disappeared.</p>

<p>One of the effects of Norman's disastrous experience
of life in London was to bring about an intense loathing
of everything connected with the turf. It was the turf
<pb n="132"/>
which had led him to be the prey of Godfree and his
brother sharpers. Excepting for the turf he never
would have been the dupe of an unscrupulous woman
who promised to be a burden to him all her life, but so
long as she was quiet and did not trouble him he resolved
not to worry, and he tried to forget her existence.</p>

<p>Then Violetta came upon the scene. She had during
her visit to Normanhurst strongly impressed him and
he was only too pleased to renew the acquaintance at
Thameside. His relations with women had been very
unfortunate and he thought he saw in Violetta all that
was desirable and all that would compensate him for
his ill luck. And then the spectre of his wife intruded
itself. What was the use of indulging in dreams which
could never be realised while Christine was tied to him?
The thought had never been absent from his mind while
enjoying Violetta's society, and when the spectre sud-
denly materialised and presented itself in flesh and blood
he felt overwhelmed and helpless.</p>

<p>There was, of course, one way out of the difficulty--
divorce. He had discovered enough about Christine
to feel pretty sure that he would not have much difficulty
in getting evidence. But he dreaded the scandal.
He also dreaded the employment of a private detective,
the sordid details, the gossip of hotel servants and all
the rest of the miserable procedure. And supposing he
obtained freedom, what then? Would it help him
to win Violetta? Would she marry a man who had
made such an utter fool of himself?</p>

<p>But in the meantime it was very plain that he must
find out what his wife intended. It could not be from
affection that she had sprung herself upon him. He
came to the conclusion that he must have a personal
interview with her. It was not safe to write. Besides,
what with <abbr>I.O.U.</abbr>'s the accepting of bills, deeds of
mortgage, loans and what not, he had had enough
of putting his name to paper.</p>

<p>The difficulty was solved by the reception of a tele-
<pb n="133"/>
gram. <q>Meet me at the Caf√© Nice at one to-day,
Christine,</q> it ran. Whether he liked it or not, he
would have to go.</p>

<p>The caf√© was crowded. Looking to the right and left
he walked slowly along the gangway between the
narrow line of tables at the side and those in the centre.
He saw the lady sitting at the far end. She had reserved
a seat for him. His distaste for the interview was in-
creased by the way in which she was dressed. The
fashion was of the latest; the colours terribly obtrusive.
He shuddered at the obvious way in which his wife--
<emph>his</emph> wife--had set herself to be looked at. She put
away the little mirror and the diminutive powder
puff when her eyes met his, and she greeted him with
a soft giggle which showed all her teeth.</p>

<p><q>I was sure you'd come, dear boy. I'll leave you
to order our lunch. You always do it so nicely.</q></p>

<p>The <q>our</q> jarred upon him, as it was probably meant
to do. She had laid such emphasis upon the pronoun.
He made no reply, but glanced at the menu and had a
brief consultation with one of the ineffable beings who
always have smiles at their command. Christine was
evidently known at the Caf√© Nice. She chatted affably
to the ineffable one who having written down Norman's
order, transmitted it to one of his subordinates to
execute.</p>

<p><q>What about an appetiser? I'm drinking gin and
angostura. Have one with me just to show there's
no ill-feeling.</q></p>

<p><q>No, thanks.</q></p>

<p><q>How awfully uppish. Don't put me out. I've
come in the best of humours. I can soon be ratty--if
you prefer it.</q></p>

<p>Norman hardly wanted telling. He judged it better
to order the <foreign xml:lang="fr">ap√©ritif</foreign>.</p>

<p><q>Don't you think I've been jolly good to let you
alone for a clear three weeks? It's quite that since
I descended upon you at Thames-side.</q></p>

<pb n="134"/>
<p><q>You were always very considerate. May I ask
the reason of your seeking me out? You went off
without a word, six months ago, and if I remember
rightly you took all the money you could find in the
place.</q></p>

<p><q>And precious little there was. It was a clean scoop,
anyhow, but I'd a right to it. I'm your wife, Jack.</q></p>

<p><q>Jack</q> always sounded horrible on Christine's lips.
Norman winced.</p>

<p><q>I don't forget the unhappy fact. But having gone,
why the deuce didn't you stay away?</q></p>

<p><q>I suppose a wife has the right to see her husband
if she wants to.</q></p>

<p><q>And apparently to leave him when the whim strikes
her.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, yes, but a whim isn't always the cause.
Now----</q></p>

<p>Her reply was cut short by the waiter depositing
a dish on the table. Nothing was said for a minute
or two. The lady was blessed with a good appetite
and <foreign xml:lang="fr">hors d'≈ìuvre</foreign>, soup and filleted sole had disappeared
before she resumed the conversation. Norman ate
slowly and without any relish.</p>

<p>The question as to why his wife had run him to earth
was still unanswered. Now and again he glanced at
her and decided that handsome as she certainly was,
her features had coarsened and her figure had lost a
good deal of its elegance. He could guess the cause.
His brief experience of married life had told him that
champagne and liqueurs had for her too strong an
attraction.</p>

<p>Christine was the type of Barbara Villiers as repre-
sented by the free and flattering pencil of Lely. But her
luxuriant hair was of a golden hue too pronounced to
be natural and it was given the lie by her dark brows
and grey eyes. The contrast, however, was undeniably
attractive and wonderful piquancy was added to her
face, especially when she laughed, by what should have
<pb n="135"/>
been a defect, but which somehow was not. Her left
eyebrow was shorter, by nearly half an inch, than the
right. Whether this difference was born with her or
had been caused by accident was of no consequence.
There it was, and it made her face very distinctive.</p>

<p>She had chosen champagne, and a couple of glasses
brought a provoking sparkle to her eyes.</p>

<p><q>Whatever my faults are, Jack dear, you must own
that I've always been frank with you. You were under
no delusions when you married me. You oughtn't to
have expected I could live otherwise than as I'd been
accustomed to. When you came to grief and the
supplies stopped I did the best thing for you and for
myself by disappearing.</q></p>

<p><q>No doubt you were ready to look after your own
interests.</q></p>

<p><q>And yours too, you silly, if you'll only think. If
I'd stopped I was bound to run you into debt. As it is
you were saved no end of trouble and worry.</q></p>

<p><q>Admitting that, do you intend to go on providing
for yourself?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, if you can't provide for me. We ought to
come to some understanding, don't you think?</q></p>

<p><q>And it was for this understanding that you sought
me out?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, partly.</q></p>

<p>Christine's cool impudence exasperated Norman almost
beyond endurance, but his equable temperament enabled
him to maintain his self-control.</p>

<p><q>Are you entitled to any consideration? You've
made no secret that you married me for what you
could get, and then, because my means were exhausted
--thanks to you and your friends--you ran away. You
must think me the biggest ass in creation if you expect
I'm going to allow you a single penny. To begin with,
it may interest you to know that if anything I'm worse
off than when you left me.</q></p>

<p><q>Rats. You Johnnies can always find coin when
<pb n="136"/>
you're put to it,</q> rejoined the lady, contemptuously.
<q>Just listen to me. I'm not going to talk sentiment;
I don't believe in it--that kind of rot's dead nowadays
--I mean business.</q></p>

<p><q>Thanks. I prefer it so.</q></p>

<p><q>You do?</q> she returned hotly. <q>Then you shall
have it, I didn't take long to sum you up, John
Norman. You're a bit of a saint, you know. You're
awfully careful of what you call your reputation. It
would send a cold shiver through you to know you're
being talked about and called a fool. I know right
enough why you kept your marriage with me a secret.
You precious soon discovered that I wasn't the sort of
woman who'd get on with your sister. You could see
that I'd have the cold shoulder from your highly respect-
able friends, and so you held your tongue.</q></p>

<p>Christine spoke the truth, and Norman inwardly
winced. But he agreed with her that there should be
no sentiment between them and he steeled himself
against any exhibition of weakness.</p>

<p><q>You, anyhow, didn't object to the secrecy.</q></p>

<p><q>Not I. Half an hour of <emph>your</emph> set as your wife and
I should be bored to death. As for <emph>my</emph> crowd, why
should they care whether I was married or not?
Marriage wouldn't make many of them any better than
they are. But to you, my dear chappie, marriage is
a sort of fetish you bow down to. To come to the point.
If you won't allow me a certain sum--weekly, monthly,
quarterly, I don't care which--why I must assert my
rights, that's all. I shall come back to you as your
wife, and if you refuse to receive me I shall apply for
restitution of conjugal rights. I don't know in the
least what it means, but my lawyer says it's the first
step.</q></p>

<p><q>Does he? I'm afraid you haven't told him all
the circumstances. You'd better go back to him and
explain that you ran away from me, and that if anybody
was entitled to those rights, it was myself. But I
<pb n="137"/>
don't intend to take any action in the matter. I don't
want you back and I won't have you.</q></p>

<p>Christine's eyes suddenly blazed, and her cheeks
became white, save where the artificial colour had been
applied. With her white tremulous lips she was fury
personified.</p>

<p><q>So that you may console yourself with that bit
of a girl you took for a joy ride! I understand.</q></p>

<p><q>Indeed you don't. As for the <q>bit of a girl</q> I
refuse to discuss her with you,</q> rejoined Norman,
coldly.</p>

<p><q>I'm not good enough, I suppose. Very well. I
shan't wait for the rubbishy conjugal rights, but shall
land myself on you whenever I think I will.</q></p>

<p><q>That means war. I shall face whatever you choose
to do. You probably won't like your life for the past
six months dug up.</q></p>

<p>Norman's unexpected show of fight sent the lady
into another paroxysm of rage. Her shoulders quivered
and her foot beat a tattoo. It was very clear that in
spite of her protestations to the contrary, she was as
susceptible to sentiment as the majority of her sex.
Norman saw quite well that she was intensely jealous
and that hatred of Violetta was at the bottom of her
threatened campaign.</p>

<p><q>My life,</q> she burst out. <q>What about yours?
Two can play at the game of divorce. You won't get
rid of me so easily as you think, my lad.</q></p>

<p><q>Very well, do your worst. In the meantime, is
it worth while continuing this luncheon any further?
I doubt if either you or I have any appetite left. Suppose
I call for the bill. Anyhow, don't let me interfere with
your arrangements. If you prefer to stay longer, pray
do.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank you for your condescension. It would have
been more to the purpose if you'd ordered another half
bottle of champagne.</q></p>

<p>Norman shrugged his shoulders, beckoned to the
<pb n="138"/>
waiter, told him to add the fresh wine to the bill and
bring the latter. The few minutes which elapsed before
this could be done were passed in utter silence. What-
ever might have been Christine's sensations, Norman's,
at all events, were anything but enviable.</p>

<p>The bill was paid, and with a formal bow Norman
was about to rise from the table when Christine motioned
him to stay. He complied, but remained standing.</p>

<p><q>Just a word which I advise you to remember,</q>
said she in rasping tones. <q>In one of our rows over
money you were complimentary enough to say you
hated women who betted. Is that your opinion now?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, stronger than ever.</q></p>

<p><q>Have you asked your new love what has been her
experience in such matters?</q></p>

<p><q>If by my <q>new love</q> you mean the lady you saw
at The Willows, I've already told you I refuse to discuss
her with you,</q> he replied, his brow darkening.</p>

<p><q>I've no desire to discuss her. I only want to tell
you that I saw her at the Alexandra Park Spring
meeting.</q></p>

<p><q>What of that?</q></p>

<p><q>Nothing, except that she wouldn't have been there
hobnobbing with <q>bookies</q> if she hadn't got a fancy
for a flutter. What would you say if I told you that
she backed one of Dan Westoby's horses at 35 to 1
and pulled it off? Dan gave her the tip, of course.</q></p>

<p><q>It's a lie,</q> he burst out.</p>

<p><q>Is it? You'd better ask her. That's all I've
got to say. Ta-ta.</q></p>

<p>Her lips curled derisively, and with a contemptuous
wave of her hand she threw him a kiss. He wheeled
round sharply, so that she could not see his face, and
walked rapidly out of the caf√© with a sickening feeling
creeping over him.</p>

<div n="14" type="chapter">
<pb n="139"/>
<head type="num">Chapter XIV</head>
<head type="main"><q>Violetta may be no better than Christine</q></head>

<p>What was Norman to think of Christine's words?
Dan Westoby had sworn to ruin him, and he had suc-
ceeded, but surely it was improbable that he should
know Violetta, and equally improbable that she would
back horses. He could not recollect a single expression
of hers to justify such an assertion. It was all the
creation of Christine's malevolence and jealousy. No
one knew better than he that his wife had not the least
respect for truth when it suited her purpose to tell a
falsehood. He tried to brush the calumny aside, but
he found it difficult.</p>

<p>He crossed Piccadilly Circus and went down Waterloo
Place into <abbr>St.</abbr> James' Park. He walked about some
time in the quietude, hoping to calm his agitated nerves
and dispel his forebodings. In the first he succeeded;
in the second he failed.</p>

<p>Norman had never been able to decide whether he
had acted wisely or foolishly in telling Violetta that
<q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe</q> was his wife. Somehow,
the words slipped out before he could stop them, but
the confession had enabled him to say that he had
acted straightly towards Violetta. Henceforward she
would be under no illusions as to his position. On
the other hand, the revelation had completed the
history of his folly and he was afraid that so shrewd
a young woman must set him down as an utter fool.</p>

<p>This did not trouble him so much as the conviction
that he had burnt his boats so far as she was concerned,
and that he had nipped their dawning friendship in
the bud. As a man with a wife living, he must stand
in a totally different light from that which represented
him as a widower.</p>

<pb n="140"/>
<p>He had thought much over this embarrassment. He
would have dearly liked to know Violetta's opinion
of him, but he had felt that to call upon her might
suggest an erroneous construction. Possibly he need
not have been so scrupulous. A man less emotional,
less given to introspection, and of a stronger mental
fibre, might not have thought twice about it.</p>

<p>But such a man would not have been in love, and
this made all the difference. It was really the key to
his present inaction. He had in his idle way often
dreamed of Violetta during the four years' separation
and the unlikelihood of realization had acted rather
as a provocative than a check. Gradually, however,
these dreams of idealistic happiness had become fewer,
and when his freedom came Violetta was but a memory.
He never thought to see her again. If ever they did
meet, in all probability she would be somebody else's
wife.</p>

<p>The unexpected had happened as it has a habit of
doing. When that meeting came about it was he who
had married. By contrast with Christine, Violetta
was perfection, and he was more than ever drawn
towards her. But what was the use of dwelling upon
the unattainable? That way madness lay, so he tried
to discover a middle road in a sort of platonic love--
generally another term for self-deception.</p>

<p>Norman was about the last man in the world who
could be trusted to try so hazardous an experiment.
He was not impersonal enough. He could not separate
himself and his emotions from anything that affected
him deeply. Love in the <q>aibstract,</q> as Sidney Smith's
Scotch young lady termed it, was to him an impossibility,
and maybe it was to impose an insurmountable barrier
to his own feelings that he had confided to Violetta
he had a wife.</p>

<p>He went over all this again and again while pacing
the Mall. Christine and Violetta--Violetta and
Christine--they danced like puppets through his confused
<pb n="141"/>
brain, and it was some time before his thoughts settled
down into something like order. Violetta, he decided,
must for the moment be placed in the background.
While he was menaced by Christine he would never
have any peace of mind. She must be dealt with at
once, and, leaving the Mall at the <abbr>St.</abbr> James's Palace
end, he jumped into a taxi in <abbr>St.</abbr> James's Street, and
was set down at Gray's Inn.</p>

<p>Marlowe &amp; Peach, of Gray's Inn Square, had been
the Normans' solicitors for three generations. There
were few family skeletons they could not take from
the japanned boxes in their sedate dimly-lighted office
with its panelled walls and long narrow windows.</p>

<p>Among these skeletons was Sir John Norman's foolish
marriage. He would have said nothing but for com-
plications with West End tradesmen arising out of
debts contracted by Christine in her husband's name.
So when he told <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlowe, a white-headed, spectacled,
solemn-looking old gentleman--in private life a genial
soul with a partiality for old port--that a divorce
was in his mind the lawyer was not surprised.</p>

<p><q>I should imagine from what I know of the lady
that there won't be much difficulty in getting up a
case against her. But it may be an expensive business.
Private detectives are like sharks--they'll swallow
all they can get. The worst of that profession is that
there's no check on their charges--no standard of fees.
I regard the employment of private detectives as part
of the punishment following a breach of morals.</q></p>

<p><q>That can't be helped,</q> rejoined Norman. <q>I'm
desperately hard up--you know that, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlowe,
as well as, or better than I do--but I must raise the
money somehow.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, there's no immediate hurry. We can carry
on the preliminaries for a time and see how things turn
out. Supposing we find a co-respondent who's a man
of means, we might go in for damages. Unfortunately,
you can hardly say you've suffered material injury in
<pb n="142"/>
her choosing to go her own way. The court might even
consider that you married her with your eyes open, and
that a good deal of what followed you might have
expected. You had more than arrived at the years of
discretion at the time of your marriage. No, I'm
afraid there's little hope of substantial damages. If
the worst comes to the worst, you'll have to sell the
last bit of unencumbered land you've got--the Owl's
Nest.</q></p>

<p><q>That would mean turning out Miss Vaughan,</q>
Norman hastily put in.</p>

<p><q>Not necessarily. It's true she's a quarterly tenant,
and a purchaser might think fit to put up her rent
at the end of her three years' agreement. You know
she's got the place dirt cheap, and but for your explicit
instructions we shouldn't have let her have it at ¬£50
a year. It's worth ¬£100 at least, and this is what
a new owner would probably want.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, I shouldn't think of selling the place. It
would be a breach of faith.</q></p>

<p><q>Would it? Miss Vaughan, I take it, is a friend
of yours, Sir John?</q></p>

<p><q>I hope so.</q></p>

<p><q>She's a very charming young lady. I was struck
by her independent and original turn of mind. She's
one that a man who wanted a clever wife might easily
fall in love with. At the same time, I fancy she wouldn't
accept anyone who chanced to offer. She'd pick and
choose. Perhaps that's why she's still single. I gather
from what she said she's lived in France for some time.</q></p>

<p><q>I believe so.</q></p>

<p><q>Father's dead, she mentioned. I suppose he left
her some money.</q></p>

<p><q>I haven't the slightest idea.</q></p>

<p><q>Anyhow, she must have some. She's indulging in
rather expensive alterations, or additions, I believe
they are. Not usual for a quarterly tenant to spend
money for the benefit of the landlord.</q></p>

<pb n="143"/>
<p><q>Miss Vaughan can do as she likes, I suppose,</q>
rejoined Norman, a little tartly. <q>I gave her full
permission. I told her she could pull the house down
if she cared to do so.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, did you? That was showing unusual confidence
in the lady.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlowe gazed penetratingly through his gleaming
spectacles at his client a second or two and then re-
marked irrelevantly as it seemed to Norman:</p>

<p><q>I had a visit from your sister the other day about
some of her investments.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes.</q></p>

<p><q>She enquired whether the Owl's Nest was still
vacant.</q></p>

<p>Norman looked suddenly uncomfortable beneath the
microscopic eye of the lawyer.</p>

<p><q>Why did she want to know? It's no affair of
hers,</q> broke out Norman angrily.</p>

<p><q>So I thought. I gave her a general answer.
Several people were after it I led her to believe.</q></p>

<p><q>Thanks for your discretion, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlowe. The
fact is Ella knows nothing about my having let the place
to Miss Vaughan.</q></p>

<p><q>That was my impression. Now, Sir John, I want
to give you a word of caution. These divorce pro-
ceedings sometimes turn out quite differently from
what one expects. To be successful you must go into
court with absolutely clean hands. The King's
Proctor----</q></p>

<p><q>Dash it all, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlowe, what are you driving at.
Surely you're not insinuating.----</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not. It isn't my fashion to insinuate. I find
it better to speak plainly. What I wish you to under-
stand is that if there is anything between you and this
extremely attractive young lady----</q></p>

<p><q>Well, there isn't. You may take my solemn word
of honour.</q></p>

<p><q>I do. But this is where the point comes in--you
<pb n="144"/>
mustn't act as if there was. Circumstances, harmless
situations, words, can be so twisted as to make white
appear black. It is to the interest of the King's Proctor
and his agents to bring about this twist. You evidently
take a great interest in Miss Vaughan. While these
proceedings are pending, I should advise you to give
the Owl's Nest a wide berth.</q></p>

<p><q>I've not been near the place since Miss Vaughan
took up her quarters there.</q></p>

<p><q>So much the better. You've begun rather un-
fortunately by not saying anything about Miss Vaughan
to your sister.</q></p>

<p><q>There were reasons why I shouldn't, since we had
already had a quarrel about her.</q></p>

<p><q>Indeed? Perhaps you'd better tell me all about it.
I mustn't be kept in the dark you know, and have a
surprise sprung upon me.</q></p>

<p>Norman had no alternative but to go over the story
of the alleged <q>joy ride</q> and of the unlucky encounter
the same evening with his wife, not forgetting the
assertion of the latter a few hours previous that she had
recognised Violetta as having been at the Alexandra
Park races.</p>

<p><q>I told her she lied,</q> concluded Norman, <q>but you
see she has grounds for making herself unpleasant.</q></p>

<p><q>Deucedly unpleasant,</q> said the lawyer gravely.
<q>If, as you say, Miss Vaughan is nothing to you, why
not tell your sister she is your tenant? It would save
disagreeable <choice><corr>innuendoes</corr><orig>inuendoes</orig></choice> being drawn.</q></p>

<p><q>I daresay it would, but I know Ella and you don't.
If I opened my mouth to her, the first thing she'd do
would be to go to the Owl's Nest and there'd be a
precious shindy between the two women. Besides,
I promised Miss Vaughan I shouldn't let Ella know.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlowe shrugged his shoulders and took a
pinch of snuff.</p>

<p><q>Well, we must hope for the best. While we're
making enquiries about Lady Norman you must lie
<pb n="145"/>
low. No visits to Miss Vaughan--that would be ab-
solutely fatal. Not even a letter.</q></p>

<p>Norman went away with the lawyer's warning in
his ears, by no means comfortable, it seemed to him
he was in a cleft stick, for the very steps he was taking
to get rid of his matrimonial burden were increasing
the obstacles in the way of his cementing his friendship
with Violetta Vaughan.</p>

<p>But one thing was paramount. He must free himself
from his matrimonial shackles.</p>

<p>He had not much faith in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlowe when it came
to a descent into the sordid and tortuous ways of life's
underworld. Spying out the antecedents of a lady
meant wholesale bribery, listening at keyholes, so to
speak, interviewing servants, always the source of
gossip and scandal. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlowe was far too respectable
for this sort of thing. He always fought shy of criminal
business and police courts generally.</p>

<p><q>I hate doing it, but there's no other way,</q> thought
Norman. <q>I'll have to employ some of the gentry
who dignify themselves by the name of private enquiry
agents.</q></p>

<p>Of course, <choice><corr>he</corr><orig>ke</orig></choice> knew none, and it was doubtful if <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Barlowe knew any either, but he wasn't going to test
the old solicitor's knowledge of the seamy side of London
life. He was quite sure that Barlowe would discoun-
tenance his contemplated action.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he had strolled back to Piccadilly Circus.
He was so absorbed that he hardly knew where he was
going, and when he discovered where his wandering
steps had borne him he paused.</p>

<p>It was far too near the Caf√© Nice. For all he knew
he might run against his wife, and this was about the
last thing he desired. He turned into that somewhat
grimy and uninteresting thoroughfare Sherwood Street,
but this led to no place in which he was interested.
Then it suddenly occurred to him that the Bodega in
Glasshouse Street would help him.</p>

<pb n="146"/>
<p>In his racketty period of married life with Christine
the Bodega was one of his houses of call. He had got
to a nodding acquaintance with some of the miscellaneous
crowd who foregather in the various resorts of the
establishment.</p>

<p><q>I'll swear I'll get the information I want out of
one of the seedy bounders who were always so ready
to drink at my expense,</q> he thought.</p>

<p>Hanging about the door of the Bodega was a shabby,
unshorn nondescript whose red nose and pallid cheeks
betrayed his besetting passion. He was selling matches
and he held out a box to Norman as the latter was
brushing past.</p>

<p><q>If it's not taking a liberty, Sir John,</q> said the man
apologetically, and with a finger to his greasy bowler,
<q>may I ask you to buy a box? I've come down a bit
since you used to tip me for fetching you taxis.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh? I don't recollect you.</q></p>

<p><q>Course you don't, sir. I'm Alf Richards. I did
a bit o' touting for you and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Godfree. I was useful
then picking up news from the stable about the cracks.</q></p>

<p><q>I think I've a glimmering of a remembrance of
your face. Things haven't gone well with you.</q></p>

<p><q>Bally bad, sir.</q></p>

<p>Norman pulled out a shilling. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Richards accepted
it gratefully, and his watery eyes became still more
watery.</p>

<p><q>By the way, Richards,</q> said Norman, <q>I wonder
whether you can help me in a little matter.</q></p>

<p><q>Only too pleased. Don't often get a job nowadays.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, it isn't what you may call a job. I want to
get on the track of a certain person, and I thought
of employing a private detective. Do you know of
anybody who does that kind of thing?</q></p>

<p><q>You've come to the very shop, Sir John. I've done
a good deal in that line myself.</q></p>

<p>Norman looked very doubtful. Alf Richards was
such a disreputable person in his appearance. His
<pb n="147"/>
speech and manner, however, were the reverse. At
some time of his life he must have mixed in fairly decent
society.</p>

<p>But Norman hesitated. Christine was certain to go
her own way, restitution of conjugal rights notwith-
standing. She passed her time chiefly at swell
restaurants. Alf Richards was hardly the man who
could shadow her at fashionable haunts. He hinted at
something of the kind.</p>

<p><q>Well, that's true, sir, but there was a time when
I knew them all; ah, and the waiters looked after me,
too. I always gave them good tips. Put me in a
decent suit and I don't think I'd disgrace you. It
would cost you less than if you went to a professional firm.
They'd run you up a big bill before you could say
knife.</q></p>

<p><q>Can I trust you?</q></p>

<p><q>Give me a chance. Do you suppose I like this
kind of life? Maybe I do go in too much for the cheerful
glass, but what would you expect? It's the only
pleasure I get. If I was sure of a regular sum per week
--I shouldn't want much--I'd keep myself straight
and not disgrace you.</q></p>

<p>Norman's good nature and his capacity for believing
the best of everyone came to the rescue of Alf Richards.</p>

<p><q>We'll go downstairs and talk over the matter,</q>
said he.</p>

<p><q>I'm not fit company for you, sir, as I am,</q> hesitated
Richards.</p>

<p><q>Oh, hang that. Come along.</q></p>

<p>They descended into the Bodega's lower regions and
Norman ordered drinks. Then he explained what he
wanted.</p>

<p><q>I don't see much difficulty, sir,</q> said Richards.
<q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Davenport isn't quite unknown to me. I've seen
her lots o' times on the race course.</q></p>

<p><q>No doubt. Well, the first thing you'll have to do
is to make yourself fairly decent. Suppose you get
<pb n="148"/>
yourself a rig out. Here's a ¬£10 note. I daresay
you know how to lay it out to the best advantage.</q></p>

<p><q>I guess I do, sir.</q></p>

<p>Alf Richards handled the flimsy piece of paper Norman
gave him as though it were a priceless treasure. His
eyes glistened and he folded it up with the greatest
care.</p>

<p><q>Now you won't let me down, I hope,</q> said Norman.
<q>It's a vital matter to me.</q></p>

<p><q>I understand, sir. I'll do my best and if there's
anything to be found out I'll have it. I've had to
worm myself into the secrets of many a racing stable
before now, and if I chose to open my mouth--well--
that kind of thing wants a bit of doing. T'other's
child's play.</q></p>

<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Richards drew a long breath and winked. The
drink had oiled his tongue, to say nothing of the sight
of the tenner and he plunged into a series of reminis-
cences to which Norman listened languidly.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard Richards mention the name of
<q>Captain Vaughan,</q> and he pricked up his ears. He
had Violetta in his mind at that moment. Her father,
as he knew very well, was Captain Vaughan. It might
be only a coincidence that Richards should also know
a Captain Vaughan, but it interested him, all the same.</p>

<p><q>What Captain Vaughan are you talking about?</q></p>

<p><q>Why, Captain Vaughan who ran the Beak Street
Sporting Club. One of the best. I was awfully sorry
to hear of him coming to grief over the sticks. He ought
not to have tried that fun at his age. But if he'd
made up his mind to do a thing he'd do it, and the
devil take the consequence. His handsome daughter
takes after him.</q></p>

<p>Norman stared at the man, and hardly dared to ask
him any more questions. But the impulse was too
strong.</p>

<p><q>Do you know his daughter?</q> said he in a voice of
suppressed excitement.</p>

<pb n="149"/>
<p><q>Miss Violetta Vaughan? I should think I do.
A clever girl and, like her dad, one of the best. The
way she managed the canteen and kept the boys in
order was a marvel.</q></p>

<p>Norman felt a sinking at the heart. There could be
no doubt that Alf Richards was speaking the truth.
But Violetta, the manageress of a drinking bar at a
sporting club! The idea was horrible.</p>

<p><q>What's become of her?</q> he ventured to say,
putting on an air of indifference.</p>

<p><q>Oh, I fancy she's tumbled on her feet. The club
went smash and she went off with the Captain to France.
What they did there I don't quite know, but it was
something to do with the turf.</q></p>

<p><q>Have you seen her since her return from France?</q></p>

<p><q>Once. It was quite by chance. At the <abbr>A. P.</abbr> Easter
meeting. She was all there, I can tell you.</q></p>

<p><q>All there? What the devil do you mean by <q>all
there</q>?</q></p>

<p><q>Why, making a book, of course. She pulled off
a real good thing. Backed <q>Daughter of the Mist</q>
at thirty-five to one and scooped. I made fifteen quid--
thanks to her tip. She must have known something,
though she swore--well, she didn't swear, she's too
much of a lady--she didn't.</q></p>

<p><q>Are you sure you're right? You're not telling me
a fairy tale just to make out how clever you are?</q>
gasped Norman.</p>

<p><q>Not likely. Why should I? It's all gospel truth,
and if I didn't know how lucky she was in the old days
in spotting winners, I wouldn't have believed it myself.
You see, <q>Daughter of the Mist</q> is one of Dan Westoby's
horses, and Dan and his gang were up to some tricks
over her. It was their game to work long odds and, by
thunder, they brought if off though the filly was nearly
beaten at the post. I don't understand how Miss
Vaughan got to know, unless she was in with Westoby's
boys. But that's impossible.</q></p>

<pb n="150"/>
<p>The more revelations Richards unfolded the worse
the thing became. Norman could listen to nothing
further. He sat still as a statue staring into space.</p>

<p><q>When I find out anything about <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Davenport
how shall I let you know?</q> said Richards, breaking
the silence.</p>

<p><q><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Davenport,</q> repeated Norman, blankly.</p>

<p><q>Yes. That was her name, you said.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, of course,</q> rejoined the baronet, rousing himself.
<q>Write to the Corinthian Club, Coventry Street.</q></p>

<p><q>All right, sir. I won't lose a minute. Any other
instructions?</q></p>

<p><q>No. You know what to do.</q></p>

<p>Norman rose abruptly. He was overwhelmed by
what he had heard. He nodded to Richards and strode
out, feeling like a man who had awakened out of a
pleasant dream. He was at that moment incapable of
coherent thought, and it was not until he had to face
the busy traffic of Regent Street that he got back to
stern reality.</p>

<p><q>So Christine was right,</q> he muttered. <q>It's appall-
ing what women can do in the way of deception. For
anything that I know, Violetta may be no better than
Christine!</q></p>

<head type="main">How a Man looks at it</head>

<p>Violetta, Belphegor, and Tim Hollis before long
became the best of friends. It wanted a little patience
so far as the horse was concerned for his temper had been
thoroughly spoilt by bad usage and the stupidity of
some of the grooms in Peter Gumley's stables, and
possibly by those who had had the training of him
when a yearling and before he came into Peter's posses-
<pb n="151"/>
sion. The animal was naturally highly nervous and
had been made more so, thanks to being continually
thwarted and thrashed. At the sight of a riding whip
he either became rebellious or shrank from it according
to his mood.</p>

<p><said>Well, what do you think of him now, Tim?</said> said
his mistress, <said>Good enough for the Two Thousand?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, he's good enough so far as his legs go,</said> returned
Tim cautiously, <said>it's when he comes to mix up with
the other gees that he mayn't be trusted. You see
Miss, ever since I knowed him he's had a fancy for
hugging his horses. It always wanted a bit o' doing to
get him to break away and show what he could do by
himself. Do you understand what I mean, Miss?</said></p>

<p><said>Perfectly, Tim. But that was in the bad old days.
I shouldn't be surprised if he hadn't felt a sort of pro-
tection in the company of his own kind. I believe
horses are very much like human beings--you and me--
for instance.</said></p>

<p><said>That's what I believe, too, Miss,</said> returned Tim,
touching his forelock quite pleased at Violetta classing
him with herself.</p>

<p>Belphegor had been brought out to show his paces
and had just done a sprint of a quarter of a mile under
Tim's skilful jockeying. The lad had extended him
fully, short as the distance was. The horse was now
standing as quiet as a lamb with a cloth thrown over
his back. He certainly was in superb condition, and
somehow did not look so ugly as when Violetta saw him
on the <abbr>A. P.</abbr> course.</p>

<p><said>I bed your pardon, Miss, for a sayin' what's in my
mind,</said> went on Tim with an apologetic cough.</p>

<p><said>Say anything you please, my lad, I don't mind.</said></p>

<p><said>That's what I like about you, Miss Violetta. You
don't snub me as Peter an' his lot was always doin'.
Not much good then my trying to have a say. I was
told to shut up an' mind my own business. As if 'orses
wasn't my business. Oh, good lor!</said></p>

<pb n="152"/>
<p><said>Well, you're not at Peter's now so get a move on
with what you were going to tell me.</said></p>

<p><said>It was just this. You'll have to train Belphegor
with other 'orses. He'll only show what he can do when
he's runnin' against them. A thing as is easy he don't
care for.</said></p>

<p>Violetta tapped her riding boots thoughtfully with her
whip. She looked a very attractive picture in her
masculine dress, and the regular hours, the out door life,
and the bracing air of the Owl's Nest with its elevated
position, had given her cheeks a glow of health she had
never had before.</p>

<p><said>Well, what do you suggest,</said> said she presently.</p>

<p><said>Buy a couple more gees, Miss.</said></p>

<p>Violetta laughed.</p>

<p><said>Gees cost money. Can't be done. Think of some-
thing else.</said></p>

<p>But Tim couldn't. He was only able to scrape the
sole of one boot on the upper of the other.</p>

<p><said>I suppose I must think of something for you. What
about taking him back to Peter Gumley?</said></p>

<p>Tim's face fell.</p>

<p><said>What, sell him? Ain't you satisfied with me?
I've done my best with Belphegor, s'truth, an' the 'orse
knows I have.</said></p>

<p><said>Don't look so distressed, Tim,</said> said Violetta gravely.
<said>You're all right, and so is Belphegor. But I'm think-
ing if Peter Gumley saw him now and saw you as well
that he'd alter his mind about you both. Peter's not a
bad sort.</said></p>

<p><said>I never said he was. It's that beast Parsons, his
stud groom, as I could never get on with.</said></p>

<p><said>That's so. Well, I've reason to know that Parsons
has been fired. He was found out robbing his master--
altering the corn bills and so on. Things are not quite
the same at Holberry Down as they were when you were
there. I had a talk with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley the other day, and
I put out a feeler after I told him how straight you'd
<pb n="153"/>
been running. The fact is he'd be very glad to have
you back.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, Miss, I'm not goin'. I'd rather stay here
that's if you'll keep me on.</said></p>

<p><said>It's this way. It's for the sake of Belphegor that I
think you ought to go to Holberry Down--you and the
horse too. He can't get the proper training here. The
ground's not suitable. What's the good of a quarter of
a mile or even half a mile to a great brute like Belphegor?
Why he only gets fairly into his stride when he's a
couple of hundred yards from the winning post. You
said yourself he wasn't being done justice to as he is.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes--but--</said></p>

<p>Tim shuffled his feet again and looked down at his toes.</p>

<p><said>Well, what is it? What's your objection?</said></p>

<p><said>I know it 'ud be a good thing for Belphegor--so long
as I was with him, but--well it's myself I've got in mind.
I'm a bit afeared of the crowd at the Barley Mow.
Barney Moss 'ud be hanging about again if he once heard
I was back at Peter's.</said></p>

<p><said>Then you mustn't go near the Barley Mow. Promise
me that.</said></p>

<p><said>Of course I will. I only hope as I'll be able to keep
my promise. I'll try, Heaven help me. I <emph>will</emph> try,</said>
burst out Tim passionately.</p>

<p><said>I'm sure you will. I'll ride over to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley's
this afternoon and fix the thing up somehow.</said></p>

<p>Belphegor was not the only occupant of the Owl's
Nest stables. Some time after the purchase of the horse
Violetta bought a beautiful pony from a local butcher.
The latter had not long had the pony in his possession,
and he had found it did not suit him or rather his man.
The creature was skittish and capricious, had bolted
twice, and on the second occasion had kicked the bottom
out of the cart and sent the joints flying. The butcher
was afraid to trust it, and he sold it to Violetta cheaply.</p>

<p>Violetta was delighted to have him, and he was soon
a great pet.</p>

<pb n="154"/>
<p>She lost no time in opening the business which had
brought her to Holberry Down, and Peter listened to
what she had to say attentively and even approvingly.</p>

<p><said>You know, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley, you're as much interested
in Belphegor as I am,</said> said she. <said>Whatever stake he
pulls off you'll have a share of. That's agreed between
us, isn't it?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, I haven't forgotten, and I'd like to see him do
some real good work. But as you say, I must have his
training under my own eye. I'm not going to have the
<abbr>A. P.</abbr> show over again.</said></p>

<p><said>Very well, that's what you won't have if you agree
to what I propose. Tim must come with him. That's
a dead cert.</said></p>

<p>Peter looked grave and fingered his chin.</p>

<p><said>I swore I'd never take the young beggar back.</said></p>

<p><said>Very likely. But what's an oath more or less,
especially where horses are concerned. I'm quite sure
there are more lies told and more oaths used on the turf
than anywhere else in the world.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, that's a fact, Miss Violetta.</said></p>

<p><said>Of course it is. Now, Tim's a reformed character.</said></p>

<p><said>If he is, he has to thank you for it.</said></p>

<p><said>No, I've just treated him decently and trusted to
his word. I've come to the conclusion that his dis-
position's very like that of Belphegor. Both must be
allowed to go their own road to a certain extent. I
confess that I'm built much on the same lines. We may
be led, but we won't be driven.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm not going to contradict you, Miss. But about
Tim--what I fear is the Barley Mow. Nothing but touts
there.</said></p>

<p><said>I know, and I may tell you that the lad's as much
afraid of the Barley Mow as you are. He's given me his
word of honour that he'll never go near the place.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, that may be, and I don't doubt as he'll try to
keep his word. But you don't know what a damned
crafty crew get there. The landlord's as bad as any of
<pb n="155"/>
'em. He's a tenant of Dan Westoby's, and I'll go bail
that the two are hand in glove. The only safe thing is
to keep the matter quiet. Not a soul must know that
I've got the two here.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, that can be done I guess. Your men are used
to keeping secrets, aren't they. Can you trust them?</said></p>

<p><said>I can now. I couldn't three months ago, but I've
weeded out the splitters, and I've got a decent lot now.
It all depends upon Tim himself.</said></p>

<p><said>And I'll answer for him. He's only to know what's
expected from him and I'm convinced he'll act up to it.</said></p>

<p><said>I hope he will. Well, we must risk it, I guess.</said></p>

<p><said>That's right. Now about Belphegor. Can he be
entered for the Two Thousand?</said></p>

<p><said>No. The day's too near. There isn't time to get
him into his best form, and I must know what he's like
before we think of him as a Derby runner. But the
Two Thousand's no good. Besides, I'm fixed on
Killarney. He's one of Lord Verschoyle's string, and
his lordship's backed him for all he's worth. I must
keep faith with Lord Frederick, who's a real gentleman.</said></p>

<p><said>So I've heard. Righto. Then we'll drop the Two
Thou. Now when will you come and have a look at
Belphegor? I shall be much surprised if you don't say
that Tim has worked wonders.</said></p>

<p><said>So much the better, but I'll wager that you've had
a hand in that same too. Begorrah! I shall never
forget that lesson in horse training you gave my chaps.
They still talk about it.</said></p>

<p><said>Only a matter of common sense and a bit of humanity
Peter. Nothing more.</said></p>

<p><said>Whatever it was it did the trick. Well I'll run over
to the Owl's Nest to-morrow evening.</said></p>

<p>So the matter was arranged. The trainer presented
himself as he promised, and when it was dark Belphegor
and Tim were transferred to Holberry Down and Gum-
ley's staff was sworn to secrecy.</p>

<p>There was every probability of the secret being kept
<pb n="156"/>
for all the men and boys who had been on bad terms
with the lad had been dismissed.</p>

<p>But when the two had departed Violetta felt strangely
desolate. It was as though her occupation was gone,
and it wasn't strange that in the vacuity of mind which
followed that her thoughts should drift back to John
Norman.</p>

<p><said aloud="false">Don't be a fool,</said> said she to herself. <said aloud="false">You know
you're not in love with the man, and if you were what
would be the good. One woman's made a fool of him,
and it would be an act of cruelty to add to his com-
plications by another woman coming on the scene.
Besides, he's a stupid. He simply drifts.</said></p>

<p>Quite so, but a drifting man is very often an object of
interest to an energetic woman. Violetta tried to
banish John Norman from her mind but she found the
effort very difficult.</p>

<p>She felt rather annoyed that he had not written to her
and angry with herself because she <emph>was</emph> annoyed. Yet
on reasoning the thing out his silence was quite ex-
cusable. After his confession of folly he probably had
regretted his outburst of confidence. No doubt his
conduct, in so doing, was perfectly proper, but it was
really putting a barrier in front of their future friend-
ship.</p>

<p><said aloud="false">I suppose that's how a man would look at it,</said> she
mused. <said aloud="false">A woman doesn't take the same view. When
a man admits to one woman what a fool he has made of
himself over another it's a sort of tribute to the superi-
ority of the woman to whom the admission is made.</said></p>

<p>There was something in this argument. The annals
of crime abound with examples. Men after perpetrating
some offence, whether robbing or violence, are restless
and unhappy until they have made some woman their
confidant. The police know this full well, and they are
quick to take advantage of it. Even <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Charles Peace,
silent and solitary worker though he prided himself on
being, was not proof against the weakness.</p>

<pb n="157"/>
<p>But Violetta was not concerned about solving sexual
problems of this kind. She did not pursue the subject,
and as the stables no longer possessed anything of
interest for her she sat down to the piano to drive away
her thoughts by grappling with the intricacies of Bach.</p>

<p>A fortnight went over and she missed the peculiarities
of Belphegor, which she was never tired of studying, and
the shrewd talk of Tim Hollis, who in some of his observa-
tions was quite the man of experience, and she felt a
restless curiosity to know how both were getting on.</p>

<p>She had not heard from Peter Gumley, but this did
not surprise her. The trainer, as he often confessed,
was no <q>scholard,</q> and to put pen to paper was to him
always a task of abhorrence.</p>

<p>The two had arranged that Peter should not go near
the Owl's Nest. Peter had reason to believe that
Barney Moss or some other tout was always lurking
about Holberry Down on the look out for some scraps
of news, and he had discovered that one of the stable
lads had been approached and offered bribes, but with-
out success. He was particularly anxious that Belphegor
should remain a <soCalled>dark horse,</soCalled> and accordingly neglected
no precautions to preserve secrecy.</p>

<p>Violetta quite agreed with this policy, but as the days
wore on her anxiety became intolerable, and she at last
came to the conclusion that though it might not be wise
for Peter Gumley to come to the Owl's Nest, as doubtless
his movements were watched, there did not seem any
harm in her calling upon him. The touts could hardly
care what she did.</p>

<p>So one afternoon she sallied forth, and mounted on
her pony she rode to Holberry Down.</p>

<head type="main">Lord Verschoyle's <soCalled>Cracks</soCalled></head>

<p>Ravenscroft House, the family seat of the Verschoyles,
was about three miles from Holberry Down Farm. It
was a big, old mansion of the Georgian period, when
architects seemed to care nothing for beauty and every-
thing for space. Ravenscroft House could not be said
to be a picturesque structure. It was a somewhat squat
building of two storeys, built of stone, and with an
enormous frontage. Its pretensions to ornament were
in the debased Italian style then affected.</p>

<p>Standing on a hill, this big white mansion, especially
when the sun shone on it, could be seen for miles around.
You caught glimpses of it between the trees in the
summer, while in the winter it stood out bleak, bare, and
gaunt.</p>

<p>While critics of to-day might denounce the taste of the
age which could produce such a house, all agreed that
it stood in the most charming of parks. The beeches of
Ravenscroft House were landmarks, and the spot was a
favourite one for picnickers when permission could be
obtained--which wasn't often--from the owner of the
property.</p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle had the military mind and the
military manner. Before he came into his title he was a
captain in the Guards and had retired after some years
of service. When the war broke out he joined up and
went through the arduous campaign with distinction.</p>

<p>He was really a good sort of fellow once you got below,
the crust of militaryism. He was nearer forty than
thirty, and his hair and moustache, ebony black in his
<pb n="159"/>
youth, had gone snow white. Certainly a distinguished
looking man, if not blessed with superfluity of brains.</p>

<p>He had just got through a generous breakfast when
Gleeson, his head groom, was announced. It was part
of the daily routine. Gleeson had to make his appear-
ance at nine o'clock exactly every morning to report as
to the horses and dogs.</p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle had the same views about punctuality
as had the old Duke of Wellington. It did not consist in
coming five minutes before the time appointed, and
certainly not five minutes later. It had to be on the tick
of the clock. Gleeson, who had had experience of his
lordship's irascibility, was very careful to observe the
law laid down.</p>

<p><said>Well, Gleeson, what are we going to do over the
Derby?</said> said his lordship, plunging at once into
business.</p>

<p><said>Well, m'lord, your lordship's got three 'osses entered
and two of 'em's in the Two Thousand. It's this way--</said></p>

<p><said>I know all about that. We needn't go into it
again,</said> interrupted the noble lord impatiently. <said>I
want to know how the horses are going on and which is
the best one to fancy. Have you heard anything from
Peter Gumley?</said></p>

<p><said>No, sir, not since the day before yesterday. I re-
ported yesterday what he said.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, what's your opinion?</said> said the noble lord,
after a pause.</p>

<p><said>Well, m'lord, I'm rather sweet on Quicksand, but
Peter fancies Killarney.</said></p>

<p><said>So do I. But there's not much to choose between
them. I wonder whether it was good policy entering
Quicksand in the name of John Smith. I did it on
Peter's advice.</said></p>

<p><said>Quite right, m'lord. It'll make a lot o' difference in
the odds. You can't win with both.</said></p>

<p><said>I suppose not,</said> rejoined his lordship, with a short
laugh. <said>But if I elect to bet on Killarney for the
<pb n="160"/>
winner, there's nothing to prevent me backing Quicksand
both ways.</said></p>

<p><said>Nothing at all, m'lord.</said></p>

<p><said>And what about Laverock?</said></p>

<p><said>I should leave her alone. She won't stay the Derby
course.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, we'll talk about her later on. It's the Two
Thousand we've got to think about. Gleeson, after
lunch let us ride over to Peter Gumley's and have a talk
with him about the cracks.</said></p>

<p><said>Right, sir. What will you ride? Polly?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, the mare suits me the best. She is the quietest
nag I've got.</said></p>

<p><said>Very good, sir; I'll be round with her in ten
minutes.</said></p>

<p>And in ten minutes, Gleeson, mounted on a stout cob,
appeared leading a beautiful chestnut mare, which one
would have said, at first sight, was scarcely up to Lord
Verschoyle's weight. It was her perfect symmetry,
however, which made her deceptive. She was really a
very powerful animal, and had the temper of an
angel.</p>

<p>His lordship and the stud groom rode along without
talking very much. Gleeson knew his master, and did
not speak unless he was spoken to. To-day, his lordship
was not in a talkative mood, and so from a con-
versational point of view the ride was a dull one.</p>

<p>At last the scattered buildings of Holberry Down
Farm came in view, and the two riders must have been
seen from afar off, for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley met them at the
garden gate.</p>

<p><said>Good afternoon, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley,</said> said my lord.
<said>Husband in?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, my lord. He half expected you to-day. He's
in the paddock. Jock,</said> she called out to a curly-
headed stable boy, who was peeping through the door
leading from the garden to the stalls, <said>come and take
these horses.</said></p>

<pb n="161"/>
<p>The boy ran forward, and Lord Verschoyle and the
groom dismounted.</p>

<p><said>Will you come through the house? It's the nearest
way to the paddock.</said></p>

<p><said>Very well.</said></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley preceded them, and they followed her
her along the passage, crossing a spacious kitchen, and,
leaving a dairy of spotless appearance on the left, went
through a kind of poultry-yard into the paddock beyond.</p>

<p><said>Eh, what's Belphegor out for?</said> exclaimed Gleeson.
<said>Surely Peter's not going to run him for the Derby?</said></p>

<p><said>Not likely, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gleeson. Peter isn't such a fool.
He knows better than run a cross-grained brute like
Belphegor.</said></p>

<p><said>I know; but what's he being trotted out this after-
noon for?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, nothing much. Only to see what a new boy
can do.</said></p>

<p><said>Rather a stiff trial, isn't it, ma'am? I mean for
the boy.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes; but Peter knows best.</said></p>

<p><said>I'll be bound he does.</said></p>

<p>Belphegor had been back about a week. His arrival
as well as the return of Tim Hollis, had been kept a
profound secret. It so happened he was being exercised
at the time of Lord Verschoyle's visit, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley
was a little embarrassed how to account for his appear-
ance in the paddock.</p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle did not matter much. He knew very
little about the horse and the little jockey, and had no
curiosity concerning them. It was different, however,
with Gleeson. The latter was bound to gossip about it,
both in the Ravenscroft House stables and at the Barley
Mow. Before long there wouldn't be any secret about
the matter.</p>

<p>But the thing was done, and all the trainer's wife
could do was to make the best of it. So she put on an
air of indifference.</p>

<pb n="162"/>
<p>Just then Peter Gumley caught sight of his visitors
and came forward to greet his lordship and the stud groom.</p>

<p><said>Well, Gumley,</said> said his lordship, <said>and how are the
youngsters going on?</said></p>

<p><said>The whole three are in prime condition, my lord.
The best lot turned out from Ravenscroft House for many
a long day.</said></p>

<p><said>Are you still bent upon making Killarney the Derby
winner?</said></p>

<p><said>I see nothing to alter my decision. It all depends
on the Two Thousand, and whether we have luck and a
good jockey.</said></p>

<p><said>Ah, that's what I want to speak to you about.
Gleeson tells me you think of putting up one of the
stable boys. Is that so?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, it was so, sir; but I've had to alter my mind
since then.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm glad of it. A stable boy would never win a race
like the Two Thousand, let alone the Derby.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm not so sure of that.</said></p>

<p><said>Now I should like to see those three horses of mine
run, Gumley.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, sir, it isn't the best time of the day. If I'd
known you were coming, I would have had them ready.
Can't you come over to-morrow and see them do a
gallop?</said></p>

<p><said>No, I can't. I've come here now on purpose. It
can't make any difference to you.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, not to me; but it makes a difference to the
horses. However, sir, have your own way.</said></p>

<p>And with a shrug of his shoulders, as much as to say
<q>It's no use contradicting this martinet,</q> Peter turned
away and gave some orders to one of the lads, who
forthwith disappeared.</p>

<p>In about twenty minutes the three shapely beauties--
Killarney, Laverock and Quicksand--appeared, looking
round with their big eyes, as much as to say, <q>What are
we brought out at this time of the day for?</q></p>

<pb n="163"/>
<p>Of the three, Killarney was the handsomest. He was
a dark chestnut, with a broad chest and powerful thighs.
He looked fit to run for a king's ransom. Laverock was
a black filly, with clean and flat forelegs, and by com-
parison with Killarney was almost narrow. Still, there
was undeniably the look of a racer about her.</p>

<p>Quicksand, on the other hand, was a grey--a very
unusual colour for a racer. He was the least <choice><corr>attractive</corr><orig>attactive</orig></choice>
of the three. He was a big horse, with a somewhat lean
head, and his frame a little clumsily built. In looks he
could not compare with Killarney.</p>

<p><said>Johnson, you will ride Killarney; Jock, you're on
Laverock; and who shall I put on Quicksand?</said></p>

<p>While the trainer's eye was wandering round, and he
was debating the point within himself, his glance fell on
Tim Hollis, who on Belphegor was at the far end of the
paddock.</p>

<p><said aloud="false">There's nobody else handy. It'll be a bit of practice
for the lad,</said> he thought.</p>

<p>So he sent for Tim, and after Belphegor was stabled the
boy presented himself.</p>

<p><said>I want you to have a go on the grey. Mind, now,
he's a lazy brute, but there's plenty of speed in him if
you know how to get it out,</said> said Gumley.</p>

<p>Tim looked at Quicksand, but said nothing. After a
minute or two he went up to the animal, patted its neck,
and talked to it, as if to introduce himself and get its
good will.</p>

<p>The cloths were stripped off the animals, and the boys
mounted and cantered across the paddock to the gate
which led on to the downs.</p>

<p>It was a breezy April afternoon, and, on the whole,
not a bad day for a spin. Peter Gumley looked a little
anxiously across the Downs, as if fearing to see Barney
Moss or any of his kidney about. But as far as the eye
could reach there was not a soul in sight.</p>

<p><said>There'll be no harm done after all,</said> muttered the
trainer. <said>No one would expect a trial to be made this
<pb n="164"/>
afternoon, and so we shall be pretty safe from the
attentions of the spies.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, Gleeson, what do you think now?</said> asked
Lord Verschoyle, as they followed the horses across the
paddock and criticised the action of each.</p>

<p><said>There's no doubt, sir, that Killarney's a grand colt.
We know what he's made of. He's got a splendid
chance for the Two Thousand, but for all that I fancy
Quicksand. Of course, everything depends upon the
riding.</said></p>

<p><said>Look here, Gleeson, we must have Tom Allworth
to ride him.</said></p>

<p><said>You must talk to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley about that, m'lord,</said>
said the groom, with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>His lordship did ask Gumley.</p>

<p><said>You seem to forget, m'lord, that you quarrelled with
Allworth just before the Epsom Spring Meeting. He
rode Tomtit because he was engaged to do so, but he
swore he'd never ride another horse of yours, and I don't
suppose he will. Tom's a man of his word.</said></p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle bit his lips and said no more. He
remembered the incident perfectly well. He had been
in an unusually bad humour that morning, and, attempt-
ing to dictate to Tom Allworth what he should do, the
distinguished jockey had virtually, if not in so many
words, told him to mind his own business. Allworth
went dead against his lordship's instructions and won
the race with Tomtit.</p>

<p>There was some little delay before Gumley got the
horses off. Killarney was apparently restive, and every
now and then his ears went back in a decidedly vicious
fashion; but at last a good start was made, and away
the three cracks went, skimming the ground like swallows,
Killarney quite a length and a half in front of Laverock,
Quicksand plodding away a length behind the second
horse.</p>

<p><said>Why, it's a foregone conclusion,</said> exclaimed Lord
Verschoyle. <said>Killarney's first and the rest are nowhere.</said></p>

<pb n="165"/>
<p><said>Wait a minute, sir,</said> said the trainer gravely.
<said>Johnson hasn't done what I told him. He was to
keep him well in hand the first half of the course. Instead
of that he's let the brute have his head. We shall see
the result.</said></p>

<p><said>Eh, look there!</said> cried Gleeson. <said>Quicksand's
coming along hand over hand. He's headed Laverock.
Laverock's beaten. See how he's creeping up. Why,
he's close to Killarney's heels--he's up to his shoulders
--he's beaten him by George.</said></p>

<p><said>By a couple of lengths, too,</said> said the trainer,
quietly.</p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle put down his glasses, and turned
sharply round to the latter.</p>

<p><said>What does this mean, Gumley? You led me to
understand that Killarney was the best horse in the
stable, and that Quicksand was simply intended to make
the running, and now this horse, which was supposed to
have no chance, beats its companion. How do you
account for it?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, sir, horses are very like men. They can't be
the same every day of their lives. But in this case I
should say it's the riding that did it. That boy got every
ounce of speed out of the grey, and he used no whip
either. How he managed it I can't think.</said></p>

<p>The trial had upset all Lord Verschoyle's calculations.
He had backed Killarney for a large amount to win, and
if the horses showed their true form that day, it looked
as if he stood a good chance to lose his money. It was
clear that to make himself safe he must back Quicksand.
Fortunately, the grey was a very long way down in the
betting, and unless the news of the running that day got
wind, his owner would be able easily to hedge, and
without much risk.</p>

<p>The horses came back at an easy walk to the paddock,
and while the cloths were being put on, Gumley favoured
Johnson with a jacketing for disobeying his instruc-
tions.</p>

<pb n="166"/>
<p><said>I did keep him in hand, sir; but the others kept
theirs in hand too.</said></p>

<p><said>If that was so, how was it that you couldn't bring
him up to the scratch when he was wanted?</said></p>

<p><said>I dunno, sir, unless he ain't as good a horse as
Quicksand, or else there was some secret in that chap's
riding. I don't believe it was, though. It was all a
fluke, after all.</said></p>

<p><said>Fluke be bothered,</said> exclaimed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley,
irritably. <said>You thought Hollis couldn't ride and you
didn't bother yourself.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't suppose he can ride any better than me,</said>
said the boy, sullenly.</p>

<p>Bob Johnson was ignominiously sent off with the
proverbial <soCalled>flea in his ear,</soCalled> and Peter Gumley turned
to Lord Verschoyle.</p>

<p><said>I guess, my lord, you can see what I think by my
hauling that disobedient young rascal over the coals,</said>
said he.</p>

<p><said>You mean that you consider Killarney the better
horse.</said></p>

<p><said>I do--if properly mounted. He didn't have a fair
chance just now.</said></p>

<p><said>Who was up on Quicksand?</said></p>

<p><said>A boy who's not had much experience. I wanted
to see what sort of stuff he was made of. That's why I
put him on Quicksand. As a matter of fact I'd no one
else available. Most of the lads get an hour or two off
about this time o' day,</said> returned Gumley carelessly.</p>

<p><said>Well, Gumley, if I know anything of horses and
riding I should say you've got a find in that youngster.
If he goes on as he's doing some day he'll be at the top
of the tree.</said></p>

<p><said>You think so, my lord?</said></p>

<p><said>Think? I'm sure of it. The way he handled
Quicksand was splendid.</said></p>

<p><said>It was pretty good. I will say <emph>that</emph>; but with a
better jockey on Killarney it 'ud be a different thing.</said></p>

<pb n="167"/>
<p><said>May be; but as matters look now, if that boy rides
Quicksand in the Two Thousand as well as he did to-day,
and Killarney runs no better, it will upset the apple
cart. I've too much at stake on Killarney to afford to
lose. I've told all my friends to back him, and they've
done so pretty heavily. Unless there's a change
in the situation it would be better to scratch Quick-
sand.</said></p>

<p>Gumley's face fell.</p>

<p><said>It'll have a bad effect,</said> said he. <said>The public won't
like it.</said></p>

<p><said>What does that matter?</said> rejoined his lordship
brusquely. <said>The public have never sacrificed them-
selves for me. Why should I sacrifice myself for the
public?</said></p>

<p><said>That's true. At the same time you can't prevent
people talking. Your lordship's name's A.1. Every-
body knows you wouldn't do anything that's unsports-
manlike.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't follow you, Gumley,</said> said the nobleman
frowningly, and tapping his riding boot with his hunting
crop.</p>

<p><said> Well, you know that when a horse is scratched the
bookies benefit. The backers lose their money. That's
a bad start to begin with, isn't it? But what do most
of 'em--I mean the backers--say when a horse is
scratched? Unless its an undoubted fact that the
horse isn't fit to run, the scratching of it's put down to
a dodge on the part of the owner or of those who are
advising him. That's the <emph>po</emph>-sition my lord.</said></p>

<p>An uneasy look crept over Lord Verschoyle's face.
He prided himself on being the soul of honour, as indeed
he was. He had always played the game, and always
would.</p>

<p><said>Hang it, Gumley,</said> he broke out. <said>I believe you're
right. Anyhow, we've got to guard against loss in the
event of Quicksand winning. What do you advise?
Back it both ways?</said></p>

<pb n="168"/>
<p><said>That's the best thing. It's a dead cert that unless
Tom Allworth rides Killarney----</said></p>

<p><said>I won't have Tom Allworth,</said> interposed his lordship
angrily.</p>

<p>Peter Gumley shrugged his shoulders and pursed up
his mouth as much as to say, <q>Then you must go to the
devil your own way, my lord.</q></p>

<p><said>Isn't there any other jockey you can put up?</said></p>

<p><said>No one that I'd care to see on Killarney. All the
best lads have their engagements, and they can't break
'em. It's a bit o' luck that Tom Allworth's free. But
it won't be for long, and I spoke to him yesterday about
Killarney, and he's quite willing--that is, if your lord-
ship's willing.</said></p>

<p><said>You oughtn't to have taken the matter into your
own hands. You ought to have consulted me first,</said>
growled his lordship.</p>

<p><said>Pardon me,</said> retorted the trainer bluntly. <said>If I'm
fit to be trusted with your lordship's horses, I'm fit to be
trusted to select the lads best suited to ride 'em.</said></p>

<p>But Lord Verschoyle would not give way, though he
knew very well Peter Gumley was in the right. His
lordship hated climbing down, and when he did he liked
to have a good excuse for it. Quite unexpectedly the
excuse was forthcoming.</p>

<p>At that moment the trim figure of a lady irreproach-
ably dressed was seen coming across the paddock towards
them.</p>

</div>



<div n="17" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XVII</head>
<head type="main">Violetta takes Lord Verschoyle in Hand</head>

<p>Peter Gumley's face changed. He did not know
whether he was sorry or pleased to see the mistress of
the Owl's Nest. Anyhow, her arrival gave him a chance
<pb n="169"/>
to leave his lordship for a brief space and enable him to
chew the cud of his reflections.</p>

<p>So with an apology to Lord Verschoyle, he hastened
to meet Violetta knowing that if he stayed to talk over
the point in dispute with his lordship a quarrel might
end the business.</p>

<p><said>I'm glad to see you, Miss Violetta,</said> said Gumley,
touching his hat. <said>But you ought to ha' been here ten
minutes ago an' you'd ha' seen a trial of the pick of Lord
Verschoyle's stables.</said></p>

<p><said>I did see it. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley and I watched the spin
from the dairy window. Tell me</said>--she went on a
little excitedly--<said>who was up on the grey? <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>
Gumley said she was sure it was Tim Hollis, but I could
hardly believe it after what you said about him.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, it <emph>was</emph> the young rascal.</said></p>

<p><said>Then you've made it up with the boy.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I don't bear no malice. Maybe I was a bit
hasty, an' p'raps I forgot I'd been a boy meself an'
sometimes kicked over the traces.</said></p>

<p><said>I'll be bound you did, Peter,</said> said Violetta
beamingly. <said>Anyhow, I'm glad you've taken Tim into
favour again. He's certain to do great things for you
sooner or later.</said></p>

<p><said>So Lord Verschoyle says.</said></p>

<p><said>Is that Lord Verschoyle?</said></p>

<p>Violetta's eyes wandered in the direction of the well
set up soldierly man who was pacing slowly up and
down, now and again tapping his riding boot with his
whip as though the action helped him to settle some
doubt in his mind.</p>

<p><said>Yes, that's his lordship. He's a real gentleman, but
he's got a bit of a temper.</said></p>

<p><said>A man's none the worse for that.</said></p>

<p><said>May be not, but there's tempers and tempers. My
lord's temper won't let him listen to reason. That's
where he makes a mistake.</said></p>

<p>Violetta laughed.</p>

<pb n="170"/>
<p><said>What's amusin' you, Miss?</said></p>

<p><said>Why, my dear man, all tempers are like that. You
must give them time to simmer down.</said></p>

<p><said>There's a lot of sense in what you say, Miss
Violetta,</said> returned Gumley, scratching his head. <said>I'll
go bail you could soothe a man's temper as well as you
can soothe a horse's. Now if you'd only take Lord
Verschoyle in hand----</said></p>

<p><said>Good Heavens, Peter, you don't want me to whisper
in the man's ear, and stroke his neck,</said> broke in Violetta
with another burst of merriment.</p>

<p><said>No, not quite that--though I'll bet that 'ud put him
in a good humour in two twos. It would <emph>me</emph>,</said> and
Peter's eyes twinkled.</p>

<p><said>I dare say, but it would put <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gumley into a
bad one. But what is it you want--I mean about Lord
Verschoyle?</said></p>

<p><said>It's just this. His lordship, a little time ago, had a
bit of a row with Tom Allworth, and Tom swore he'd
never put his legs across one of the Verschoyle string
again.</said></p>

<p><said>Did Tom say that to Lord Verschoyle?</said></p>

<p><said>No. He said it to Gleeson, Lord Verschoyle's stud
groom, and of course the blundering blockhead carried
Tom's words to his master. That's how mischief's
made--people's stupid tongues. It put his lordship's
back up and he now swears he won't have Tom ride
Killarney. All I've got to say is that if he doesn't go
back on his word, he'll come a cropper. Killarney, bar
accidents, can't win if Quicksand runs his best.</said></p>

<p><said>And will he?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, I'm going to put Tim up, and you saw how the
boy handled the grey.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, but why doesn't Lord Verschoyle back Quick-
sand?</said></p>

<p><said>He will to a certain extent, but he's too deep in with
Killarney to make anything. If he gets his money back
supposing Quicksand wins, it'll be as much as he will,
<pb n="171"/>
and he'd rather the chestnut won, even though he
didn't clear a penny.</said></p>

<p><said>I understand. I might feel that way myself over
Belphegor.</said></p>

<p><said>Belphegor--h'm.</said></p>

<p>An uneasy look crept over the trainer's face.</p>

<p><said>Well, what about Belphegor?</said></p>

<p><said>It's the deuce of a bit of bad luck that the brute
should be in the paddock when Lord Verschoyle and
Gleeson came. Gleeson's bound to spot him.</said></p>

<p><said>What of that? No one knows that you sold him
to me, and that he's been at the Owl's Nest until a week
or so since.</said></p>

<p><said>No one know? Parsons knew. He saw you work
your magic on the horse, and he was in the stables when
you rode him away.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, but he doesn't know that Belphegor's mine.</said></p>

<p><said>No, he doesn't know that. No one does.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, why shouldn't I have taken the horse to the
Owl's Nest to complete the training process. I've
returned him to you now that I'm satisfied. Can't you
see how it works out?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes--but--well nothing can be done. Belphegor's
entered for the Derby, and I want him to win for your
sake. <emph>I</emph> know and <emph>you</emph> know what he can do, but no one
else must, or our pitch'll be queered--I mean so far as
our bets are concerned.</said></p>

<p><said>I thought you never betted, Peter.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm going to break my rule. I'm in with you Miss,
you know. But I must get back to his lordship. I can
see he's <choice><corr>fidgeting</corr><orig>fidgetting</orig></choice>. Do come with me, Miss Violetta,
and put in a word for Tom Allworth.</said></p>

<p><said>All right. But we must be artful. His lordship
may bolt when the subject's introduced.</said></p>

<p><said>Not with you, Miss, a guiding him.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, we'll see.</said></p>

<p>And the two marched across the paddock to where his
lordship was impatiently awaiting them.</p>

<pb n="172"/>
<p><said>Confound it, Gumley, I was beginning to think
you'd----</said></p>

<p>And then his eyes fell on Violetta's winsome face, and
he came at once under the spell of her smile. He raised
his hat.</p>

<p><said>I excuse you, Gumley. You had every reason for
delaying.</said></p>

<p>He fixed his eyes upon Violetta and his features
relaxed pleasantly.</p>

<p><said>A neighbour of yours, my lord,</said> said Peter. <said>Miss
Violetta Vaughan of the Owl's Nest.</said></p>

<p><said>I congratulate myself on my good luck,</said> said Lord
Verschoyle, and he held out his hand, which Violetta
took.</p>

<p><said>Miss Vaughan is one of the best judges of a horse
that I know,</said> went on the trainer. <said>She saw the trial
spin just now and she'll give you her opinion.</said></p>

<p><said>If you care to have it,</said> said Violetta frankly.</p>

<p><said>Care? of course I care. I'd sooner have a woman's
opinion than a man's on anything in this world. It's
marvellous, Miss Vaughan, how keen your sex is in going
straight to the point.</said></p>

<p><said>Not always,</said> laughed Violetta. <said>When the matter
concerns us personally, we are frightfully biassed.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, in this case, I hope you'll be impartial.</said></p>

<p><said>I'll try to be. What would you like me to say?</said></p>

<p><said>My dear <choice><corr>young</corr><orig>youg</orig></choice> lady, is that your idea of impartiality?
Gad, it isn't what <emph>I</emph> like, but what <emph>you</emph> like. Don't be
afraid to say what's in your mind. You saw how the
grey, which was supposed to be an inferior horse to the
chestnut, turned out the faster.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, I saw that, yet I should think with proper riding
the chestnut should have won.</said></p>

<p><said>There, my lord, what did I tell you?</said> said Gumley
turning to the nobleman.</p>

<p><said>Oh, I know,</said> said Verschoyle playfully. <said>When
you experts agree, your unanimity, like that of people
on the stage, is wonderful. But your reasons, please.</said></p>

<pb n="173"/>
<p><said>No, you must accept my judgment if you accept
anything. If I gave you my reasons, they might be
worthless.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, anyhow, I suppose I may take it that with such
jockeying as to-day, Killarney wouldn't pull off the Two
Thousand.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm sure he wouldn't, especially if Tom Allworth
had a good mount against him. I'm told that Tom is
considering an offer.</said></p>

<p><said>The devil he is. Did you know that Peter?</said></p>

<p><said>I've heard something of the kind,</said> said the trainer
stolidly. <said>What I <emph>do</emph> know is that he's not fixed up.</said></p>

<p><said>I'd give anything to see Tom Allworth on that lovely
chestnut. What did you say his name was, Lord
Verschoyle?</said></p>

<p><said>Killarney.</said></p>

<p><said>That settles it. He must belong to dear old Ireland
--like myself. My mother was Irish.</said></p>

<p><said>She must have been a very beautiful woman.</said></p>

<p><said>If you talk like that, Lord Verschoyle, I shall
believe that you also have Irish blood in you. You have
quite the Blarney touch,</said> said Violetta saucily.</p>

<p><said>Have I? It must have come on since I've been
talking to you.</said></p>

<p>Peter Gumley chuckled to himself.</p>

<p><said>Wheedled him into a good humour,</said> he muttered.
<said>I knew she would.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, we needn't discuss Ireland. It's a forbidden
subject to most English people. The point is Tom
Allworth and Killarney. Who are you putting on my
dear Irish horse?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, we've not decided.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, that's splendid,</said> exclaimed Violetta clapping
her hands. <said>Then you must engage Tom Allworth.
It would be a real treat to see him romp in a couple of
lengths ahead.</said></p>

<p><said>H'm--h'm--</said></p>

<p><said>What does that mean?</said> asked Violetta with a
<pb n="174"/>
mocking smile. <said>I take back what I said just now
about your lordship's possible Irish origin. I believe
you're from north of the Tweed. H'm--h'm--is
Scottish for everything, isn't it?</said></p>

<p><said>You're a witch, Miss Vaughan. My grandmother
was Scottish. So you'd like to see Tom Allworth in
Killarney's saddle?</said></p>

<p><said>I should love it.</said></p>

<p><said>Then by jove you shall. Peter, Miss Vaughan's
talked me over. I can't resist her. See Tom and make
the best arrangements you can with him.</said></p>

<p>Then wheeling round to Violetta, he said with an air
of gallantry, which sat well upon him, after a rapid
glance at her semi-masculine riding costume, and at the
whip in her hand.</p>

<p><said>I see you have ridden here. May I have the honour
of escorting you part of the way to the Owl's Nest--
that is if you're going there?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes. Thank you very much.</said></p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle liked the simplicity and directness
of her manner. There was nothing of the coy maiden
about her, and he wondered what her age was.</p>

<p><said aloud="false">She doesn't look a day older than twenty-one. But
hang it, who can tell what a woman's age is now-a-days,</said>
was his thought.</p>

<p>He admired also the frank way with which she
accepted his assistance to mount her pony, though he
was quite sure she did not need it.</p>

<p>Soon they were side by side, Violetta considerately
walking her pony. She was rather taken by the bluff,
stand-no-nonsense manner of the military nobleman,
and she had not the slightest objection to a chat with
him. It was so long since she had talked to a gentle-
man, and she knew one when she saw one--no woman
better.</p>

<p><said>That's a pretty pony of yours. Nice easy action.
And if I may make so personal a remark you sit your
<pb n="175"/>
saddle to perfection. I don't mean to compliment you
--it's a simple fact.</said></p>

<p><said>I suppose it is as I've been told the same thing
before. But its nothing extraordinary seeing I've been
accustomed to riding ever since I can remember any-
thing.</said></p>

<p><said>The deuce you have. Well I envy you. I don't
think I straddled a horse before I left Eton. Ever
hunt?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, a little.</said></p>

<p><said>In this part of the country?</said></p>

<p>Violetta paused for a moment. She wondered if it
would be prudent to mention that she had ridden with
Sir John Norman's hounds. She decided she would
keep silence.</p>

<p><said>I can't quite remember. I hunted a little in
France.</said></p>

<p><said>Ah, that's interesting. A bit of difference, I guess,
between French and English hunting.</said></p>

<p>Violetta admitted that there was, and as soon as
possible changed the subject in which she was assisted
by a fit of playful rebellion on the part of Bruce, her
pony.</p>


<p>Bruce was more than usually restive. He reared, he
threw back his head with an impatient jerk, he moved
when he so condescended, at awkward angles, he went
through a performance as if he was treading on hot
plates.</p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle was at first prompted to go to her
assistance, but he saw that the young horsewoman was
perfectly cool and collected, and he contented himself
with watching her. Soon she had the pony quite gentle
and subdued. She had never once lost her control over
him.</p>

<p><said>By jove,</said> called out his lordship, <said>you know some-
thing. Bravo! And you never once used the
whip.</said></p>

<p><said>I never do, I don't believe in it</said></p>

<pb n="176"/>
<p><said>Well, you may be right, but--well that isn't my way
with a stubborn and tricky brute like that.</said></p>

<p><said>You're not stubborn and you're not tricky are you,
dear?</said></p>

<p>She bent on Bruce's neck and stroked his mane.</p>

<p><said>Well, if he isn't, he's uncommonly near being both.
Take care he doesn't get you unawares some day and
throw you.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm not a bit afraid of that. He's really only got
one real fault.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, you admit that, do you? And what may that
fault be?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, he has an unpleasant habit of stopping at
every public house he comes to,</said> said Violetta gravely.</p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle burst into a Homeric fit of laughter.</p>

<p><said>Of course. Its a sign of his intelligence,</said> she went
on gravely.</p>

<p><said>How's that?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, you see, his last owner was a butcher, and I
suspect the butcher's man got him into the habit. As
I don't happen to be in the butchering trade, the habit's
somewhat embarrassing, but I hope to cure him
of it.</said></p>

<p><said>And I don't doubt you'll succeed. I don't mind
betting a <soCalled>monkey</soCalled> that you'd succeed in anything
you'd a mind to.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, I should try, of course.</said></p>

<p>Once more the horses were walking quietly enough,
and the talk and interchange of rallies went on gaily.</p>

<p>Then they came to the steep path leading up to the
Owl's Nest.</p>

<p><said>I'll bid you good day here, please,</said> said Violetta.</p>

<p><said>Mayn't I come up the hill with you?</said></p>

<p><said>No. Your horse isn't used to it, and my pony is.
Besides, I've taken you a sufficient distance out of your
way.</said></p>

<p><said>That doesn't matter a bit. I'd ride any number of
miles for the sake of your company.</said></p>

<pb n="177"/>
<p><said>I'm not going to test your endurance. I should
bore you to death.</said></p>

<p><said>By the lord----</said></p>

<p>The nobleman stopped. Some foolishness was on the
tip of his tongue. Though he had escaped the chains of
matrimony, he had had his love affairs, serious and
flimsy, and though arrived at middle age, he was not
averse to a flirtation.</p>

<p>Possibly Violetta read his thoughts. She shot him an
enigmatical smile and set her pony at a canter up the
ascent.</p>

<p><said>Would it be a liberty if some day I called at the
Owl's Nest?</said> he shouted after her.</p>

<p>She turned her head towards him, but whether she
shook it or nodded he could not quite determine. At
any rate, she gave him no answer.</p>

<p><said>Provoking, bewitching hussy,</said> was his lordship's
comment as he rode away.</p>

<div n="18" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XVIII</head>
<head type="main">A Memory of Monte Carlo</head>

<p>It was the day of the Two Thousand. The crowd which
assembles at Newmarket on this occasion is but a
handful compared with that which streams to Epsom
by road and rail on the Derby Day. The event is purely
a sporting one, and the bulk of the spectators are more
or less interested in the result pecuniarily.</p>

<p>The paddock was fairly thronged, and here was a good
sprinkling of turf <choice><corr>habitu√©es</corr><orig>habitues</orig></choice>. Westoby was there, looking
stonier and more saturnine than ever. The news that
Tom Allworth was to ride the favourite had disturbed
him considerably, the more so because the intimation
had only leaked out at the eleventh hour. He had
<pb n="178"/>
made his book on the strength of Killarney losing,
and there was not time to hedge.</p>

<p>Peter Gumley looked on cool and imperturbable, and
was perfectly impervious to Westoby's overtures of
affability. For some reason, the bookmaker seemed
anxious to make up old differences with the trainer.
Lord Verschoyle was bluff and boisterous as usual, but
he was nervous all the same.</p>

<p>Not far from the judge's box, leaning against a post
which supported the rope, was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barney Moss, to-
gether with a group of companions as flashy-looking and
as loudly dressed as himself.</p>

<p><said>What ought we to win over this, Barney?</said> asked
a short, red-faced young man, in a covert-coat and bowler
hat.</p>

<p><said>Five thou', clean as a whistle. Killarney can't
lose.</said></p>

<p><said>And over the Derby?</said> went on the red-faced in-
dividual, with a wink.</p>

<p><said>Wait till it comes,</said> said Barney, shortly. <said>Don't
you open your mouth too wide over the Derby, Buttons,
old man, or you may spoil the game.</said></p>

<p>At this moment up stalked Ned Strangeways, shabbily
dressed, dark man, with a dirty bird's-eye scarf round
his neck, with an enormous pin stuck in it.</p>

<p><said>Mossy,</said> said Strangeways, a well-known bookie,
in an excited whisper <said>are you sure you're on the right
tack with Killarney?</said></p>

<p><said>Sure? D'ye think I'm a juggins!</said> returned
<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moss, scornfully.</p>

<p><said>I've the tip that the winner is Quicksand--blue
with silver stripes.</said></p>

<p><said>If you don't believe what I say,</said> went on Strange-
ways, <said>ask Peter Gumley. Quicksand comes from his
stables.</said></p>

<p><said>A fat lot one's likely to get out of Peter. He's as
close as they make 'em,</said> retorted Barney. <said>I'll bet
any money that Quicksand's entered to make the running
<pb n="179"/>
for Killarney. Bah! it's all rot. Do you imagine
I don't know a thing or two? Shut up--here come
the horses.</said></p>

<p>It was the preliminary canter. Killarney stood out
from the lot by his beautiful symmetry of form and his
grand action. Still, after the intelligence brought by
Strangeways, it was only natural that the blue and silver
stripes should attract a little attention.</p>

<p>All this time Barney Moss had got his eyes fixed on
Quicksand's jockey. There was something in the
jockey's face which haunted and puzzled him.</p>

<p><said>If I didn't know it couldn't be,</said> he muttered, <said>I'd
swear that was Tim Hollis.</said></p>

<p>However, there was no possibility of satisfying his
doubts, for the horses were half-way down the course
on the way to the starting post.</p>

<p>There was the usual interval of expectation, and then
a shout of <said>They're off!</said> went up. Barney Moss,
who had come down to Newmarket in a motor, was
standing in the driver's seat, and, armed with a big
field glass, watched the race intently.</p>

<p>The start was a very good one. The horses went off
in a cluster, and for a hundred yards or so it was difficult
to tell which was first. Then a chestnut got away
from the ruck, and some backer of this particular animal
yelled enthusiastically: <said>Birdcage wins for a hundred!</said></p>

<p><said>Birdcage, be hanged!</said> said Moss. <said>Why, he's
challenged already.</said></p>

<p>And so he was by two horses--one was Killarney,
the other was the <soCalled>dark</soCalled> horse, the outsider, Quick-
sand.</p>

<p>Suddenly Moss uttered an oath. Quicksand was
forging ahead; if he could only stay he must win.
Killarney was close behind, and with that clever con-
summate horseman, Tom Allworth on his back, no
one could say what might happen. Certain it was
that the half-length which divided the first and second
horse was being maintained.</p>

<pb n="180"/>
<p>But as they neared the judge's box the skill of Allworth
was shown. He called upon his horse, and Killarney
gamely answered. No one knew exactly how it was
done, but somehow Killarney was landed on the post
the winner by a short head of the Two Thousand.</p>

<p>A great roar went up from the crowd, for the victory
of Killarney was popular; but two or three knowing
ones shook their heads and said it was a good thing
the rider of Quicksand was not as good a jockey as
Tom Allworth, or he must have won.</p>

<p>Directly the result was known, Barney Moss jumped
from his seat on the motor with the object of satisfying
his doubts as to Quicksand's jockey. The latter, how-
ever, had disappeared, and Moss did not trouble much
about the matter, seeing that his end--the victory of
Killarney--had been achieved.</p>

<p>There was not less excitement in the grand stand
than among the crowd below, and Lord Verschoyle
was warmly congratulated by his friends on Killarney's
win, and his lordship received these congratulations
with the air of a man who had passed successfully
through an anxious ordeal.</p>

<p><said>Thanks, boys,</said> said he. <said>I hope you'll all put
money in your pocket.</said></p>

<p><said>As it's turned out, it's all right,</said> laughed Sir Fred-
erick Dartnell, an old comrade of Lord Verschoyle in
the Guards, <said>but by Jupiter, it was a near thing. No
other man in England but Tom Allworth could have
snatched victory right on the post. Who's----</said></p>

<p><said>Excuse me, Dartnell, but I see a friend yonder
I want to have a word with.</said></p>

<p>His lordship had caught sight of Violetta, who, very
quietly and unobtrusively dressed, was sitting in a
dark corner which she had purposely chosen, as she
did not want to be recognised by George Godfree, who
she made sure, would be somewhere on the course.</p>

<p>After the race was over, she had risen to find her
way to the railway station. She had no interest in
<pb n="181"/>
anything but the running of Killarney and Quicksand,
and did not care even to congratulate Peter Gumley
and Tim Hollis. She could do that easily enough on
her return to the Owl's Nest.</p>

<p>But her intention of slipping away unobserved was
baulked by Lord Verschoyle, whom she saw squeezing
through the crowd towards her.</p>

<p><said>I've only just caught sight of you, Miss Vaughan,</said>
said he, holding out both his hands and his face beaming.
<said>To think of meeting you here!</said></p>

<p><said>Why not? You know how I love to see horses
run.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, but----</said></p>

<p><said>Well, what about the but?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, it's not quite <q>but,</q> its <q>bet.</q> Silly joke. I
apologise. What I mean is, do you back your fancies?</said></p>

<p><said>Sometimes,</said> rejoined Violetta, composedly. <said>What's
right for a man is, I suppose, right for a woman.</said></p>

<p><said>H'm--well, I'm not going to argue--you always
get the best of it. Anyhow, right or wrong, I've reason
to thank you. Gad, but for your sticking up for Tom
Allworth, I don't believe I'd have climbed down. Had
any other jockey been in his place, I stood to lose ¬£10,000.
As it is, I've won ¬£20,000.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm very glad to hear it. A mistake though,
wasn't it, to plunge so heavily.</said></p>

<p><said>Perhaps, but it happens to be my way in every-
thing I do. I must go the whole hog, you know. And
that brings me to what's uppermost in my mind. My
mother gives a dinner party the week after the Derby,
and I'm going to ask her to send you an invita-
tion.</said></p>

<p><said>Please don't.</said></p>

<p>In spite of herself, a look of dismay crept over her face.</p>

<p><said>I shall quote your own words--why not?</said></p>

<p><said>I rarely go to dinner parties. I prefer my own quiet
life, and I don't want to be dragged out of it. Besides,
I'm quite sure your mother wouldn't like me.</said></p>

<pb n="182"/>
<p><said>What on earth does that matter? I like you, and
that's everything.</said></p>

<p>This blunt announcement was quite in accordance with
Lord Verschoyle's temperament, and Violetta did not
attach much importance to it. Certainly, it did not dis-
please her.</p>

<p><said>Your liking me surely doesn't involve me in going
through the ordeal of a full dress dinner party,</said> she
retorted laughingly. <said>I'm much too ingrained a
Bohemian to feel at home in anything out of my nomadic
habits.</said></p>

<p><said>But it's just that spice of Bohemianism which
makes you so charming. Now, merely to please me,
do accept my mother's hospitality. I've a particular
reason for wanting you to know her.</said></p>

<p><said>And may I enquire the reason?</said></p>

<p><said>Just my whim, that's all.</said></p>

<p><said>Not good enough, Lord Verschoyle. I've never
subjected myself to the whim of anyone, and I'm not
going to begin.</said></p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle was not deaf to the tone of hauteur
which had crept into Violetta's voice.</p>

<p><said>You're right,</said> said he, after a pause. <said>I apologise.
Don't be angry. At the same time--well, I wish you
weren't so dashed independent.</said></p>

<p><said>Sorry, but I'm afraid I can't alter.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't ask you to alter. I wouldn't have you
anything different from what you are. But I hate un-
certainties. Do you mind telling me right out what
answer you'll send my mother if she does write
you.</said></p>

<p><said>I shall thank her, of course, acknowledge the honour,
etcetera, but point out that as a perfect stranger to
her ladyship, I could not accept her kind invitation.</said></p>

<p>The handsome face of the nobleman was clouded.</p>

<p><said>She won't like that. It'll look like a snub,</said> said
he, quickly.</p>

<p><said>There's an easy way of avoiding all unpleasantness.
<pb n="183"/>
You needn't say a word to her about me. I'm very
certain she'd feel embarrassed if you do. <emph>I</emph> should
feel so under similar circumstances.</said></p>

<p><said>I wish you women were not so like cats,</said> he blurted
out.</p>

<p><said>Thank you.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, you know what I mean. Your claws are
always ready to scratch one another.</said></p>

<p>His lordship was unquestionably disappointed and
inclined to be snappy, as Violetta saw plainly enough.</p>

<p><said>I fancy men have claws, too,</said> said she, quite un-
disturbed. <said>I won't retaliate--just to show you
I'm not what you've accused me of being.</said></p>

<p>The cloud cleared away. Lord Verschoyle was no
sulker.</p>

<p><said>You're an awfully good sort, Violetta--I may call
you, Violetta, mayn't I?--but confoundedly obstinate.
I'm obstinate too, and I tell you straight that some day
my mother <emph>shall</emph> know you, and I don't mind proph-
esying that she'll like you as much as I do. But we'll
say no more about the dinner party since you don't
care for it. Have I pleased you?</said></p>

<p><said>I'm very grateful.</said></p>

<p><said>As a reward, may I call upon you? I asked your
permission once before, if you remember, but you
neither gave nor refused it.</said></p>

<p><said>I can't prevent your calling, I suppose.</said></p>

<p><said>That's sufficient. Thanks. You're not leaving,
are you?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes. I don't want to spoil the recollection of that
splendid Two Thousand race by seeing any other. I'm
going to the railway station.</said></p>

<p><said>Then I'll go with you if you've no objection. My
car is at your service.</said></p>

<p>He seemed so desirous of doing the amiable, that
Violetta hadn't the heart to disappoint him. After
all, his society and his rough and ready speech were very
agreeable. He had not attempted to pay her fulsome
<pb n="184"/>
compliments, a form of masculine homage which she
thoroughly abhorred.</p>

<p>Verschoyle escorted her from the grand stand, and
they edged their way through the crowd at the entrance.</p>

<p>Just as they emerged, Violetta heard a hoarse strident
laugh which she knew well enough, and she turned her
head aside to avoid being recognised by George Godfree.</p>

<p>But she was too late. He had seen her. She was
not going to show she was afraid of him, and she went
on resolutely.</p>

<p>Godfree had a reputation for impudence which his
conduct fully justified. He knew Lord Verschoyle by
sight quite well, but this made no difference--indeed,
it rather provoked him to annoy Violetta. He came
close to her.</p>

<p><said>Mercy on us,</said> she heard him say. <said>How proud
we have grown. It's not like you, Violetta, to forget
old friends.</said></p>

<p>She felt intensely angry at the fellow's insolence. She
wouldn't have cared a bit had she been alone, but it was
horribly humiliating for her to know that Lord Ver-
schoyle should be made aware that she was acquainted
with so disreputable a blackguard as George Godfree.</p>

<p>In the contemptuous glance she cast at him she saw
that Godfree had further deteriorated since she last
met him. Not indeed in his dress; for his clothes were
of the latest cut and had evidently been made by a
Bond Street tailor. But his face!</p>

<p>Godfree had been <soCalled>touching</soCalled> money of late since
his association with Dan Westoby, and he had been
living like a fighting cock. The results were seen
in his blotched bloated cheeks, his watery eyes, and his
loose lips. Violetta looked at him in disgust.</p>

<p>Then her expression changed. By the side of Godfree
was a man whose hard, colourless face, cold eyes, and
thin lips, carried her memory back to Monte Carlo--
to that eventful night when for the last time in her
life she acted as a mascotte at the gaming table.</p>

<pb n="185"/>
<p>The man on whom her gaze was resting was he for
whom she won ¬£500, half of which he had insisted upon
handing over to her. Nothing but dire necessity had
induced her to accept it, and it had remained a burden
on her mind ever since.</p>

<p>She had often longed for the opportunity of returning
it, but how was it to be done when she did not know
the name of the man, or where he was to be found?</p>

<p>And here he was raising his hat to her, a cold smile
lighting up his flinty face. She could not do otherwise
than acknowledge the salutation, and she did so with
the slightest possible inclination of her head. Godfree
she simply ignored.</p>

<p><said>Will you hurry, please,</said> she whispered to Lord
Verschoyle. <said>I want to get away from these men.</said></p>

<p>Verschoyle was much too chivalrous a gentleman
not to come to her rescue whatever he might think
of her knowing such riff-raff of the turf as George Godfree.
He slipped her hand beneath his arm as if to challenge
the others to question his right of possession.</p>

<p>Not a word passed until they were within the motor.</p>

<p><said>I don't know whether I ought to explain why
those two men recognised me,</said> said she.</p>

<p><said>Certainly not. Why should you? I'm not curious.</said></p>

<p><said>That I quite believe. Well, some day I may tell
you. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Godfree I know to be a dishonourable,
treacherous man. I've nothing to do with him, yet
for some reason he chooses to be offensive whenever
we chance to meet as we did just now. His companion
I can't say I know anything of. I met him once abroad,
and that is the extent of our acquaintance.</said></p>

<p><said>I congratulate you. Dan Westoby's not a very
desirable man to have for a friend. I doubt if he has
one.</said></p>

<p><said>I beg your pardon, Lord Verschoyle. What did
you say his name was?</said></p>

<p><said>Dan Westoby. He's well known on every race
course. Better known than trusted, I should say.
<pb n="186"/>
More than one man's had reason to curse his acquaint-
anceship, poor Sir John Norman among the number.
How the deuce he managed to let the scoundrel get
hold of Normanhurst, I can't make out. It was a
swindle, I'll swear. You know Normanhurst, of course,
Miss Vaughan. It's not more than ten miles from the
Owl's Nest.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, I know the place,</said> said Violetta, in a subdued
voice.</p>

<p><said>Norman's one of the best of fellows, but an awful
fool in some things. He was beastly unlucky in his
marriage.</said></p>

<p><said>So I've heard.</said></p>

<p><said>Ever met him?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, but I haven't seen him for a long time.</said></p>

<p>There was no earthly reason apparently why they
should talk about Norman, but Violetta instinctively
guessed Lord Verschoyle's motive. He wanted to
avoid causing her embarrassment by any reference to
her unfortunate recognition of two undesirables and
she was grateful to him for his tact.</p>

<p>They reached the station, Violetta was conscious
of a restraint in Lord Verschoyle's manner. She was not
surprised, but all the same she felt intensely mortified.
Not that it mattered, she told herself. What was
Lord Verschoyle to her? The present was but the
second time she had met him. No, it was of no con-
sequence, and after a few hours had gone by she would
probably forget the unpleasant episode.</p>

<p>But in her heart she knew it wouldn't be so. Some-
how she wanted to stand well in Lord Verschoyle's
sight, but had she been asked to say why, she would
have found it difficult to answer the question. Lord
Verschoyle's last utterances did not add to her
tranquillity.</p>

<p><said>We shall be running across each other again, I hope,
Miss Vaughan. These chance meetings have a charm
of their own.</said></p>

<pb n="187"/>
<p><said>Indeed they have. The unexpected is some-
times pleasant--or the reverse--more often the re-
verse.</said></p>

<p>She had no sooner left fall the words than she wished
she could have recalled them. They sounded like a
reference to what had happened, and as though the
incident was still rankling in her mind, whereas all along
she had been trying to make it appear that she regarded
it with indifference.</p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle put her into a carriage when the
train came up, and stood at the window until the guard's
whistle was heard.</p>

<p><said>Well,</said> said he, as he raised his hat, <said>I suppose our
next excitement will be the Derby. You gave me
such good advice over Killarney's mount to-day that
I shall be tempted to seek it again if I'm in a difficulty.
<foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="roman">Au revoir</foreign>.</said></p>

<p>All very nice, very flattering, very friendly--in a
way--but it had not the bluff heartiness of Lord Ver-
schoyle's usual speech.</p>

<p>Violetta sat back in her seat and sighed wearily. The
day which had begun so joyously had ended in vexation
of spirit.</p>

<p><said>All is vanity. I suppose that's what everything
in this world comes to,</said> she murmured. <said>I wonder
what Lord Verschoyle would have thought had I agreed
to accept his mother's invitation. I'm glad I didn't.
It might have forced me to give some explanation how
I came to know those two men. I doubt if I should
have the courage to tell him the truth.</said></p>

<p>It was odd the thought should cross her mind that
had Lord Verschoyle been Sir John Norman, she would
not have the same timidity. Yet Norman hated racing,
and all its associations; and with the nobleman it
was just the reverse. Was it because Norman was as
Lord Verschoyle put it, <q>an awful fool?</q></p>

<p>But she did not trouble to decide the point. Dan
<pb n="188"/>
Westoby's pallid face--expressionless save for a certain
suggestion of malignance--came into her memory and
drove out everything else.</p>

<p>To think that she was under an obligation to this
unscrupulous trickster, who was held in utter contempt
by honest, straight-going racing men, was abhorrent, and
her self reproaches were all the more bitter because it
was he who had ruined Sir John Norman.</p>

<p>There was really nothing in her past life which was
personally to her discredit. It was rather the other
way about. Considering her surroundings at the Beak
Street Club, and her associations and temptations in
Paris and Monte Carlo, the marvel was that she had
passed through such vicious circles unscathed. Her
knowledge of the seamy side of life had made her a
little cynical, but with that cynicism had come a <choice><corr>tolerance</corr><orig>tolerance</orig></choice>
of the weaknesses of human nature which kept her
heart open to sympathy and generous impulses.</p>

<p>But what would outsiders think--even those who
might be charitably disposed towards her? If all
were known, women would pass her by on the other
side, men would wink and smile and whisper innuendoes.
There had been times when Violetta would not have
cared a jot what the world said about her, but then
she was of no importance to herself.</p>

<p>It was different now; for the first time in her life she
felt frightened. What a hold these two men George
Godfree and Dan Westoby had over her if they chose
to open their mouths! Between them they practically
knew everything. Godfree could tell tales of the Beak
Street Club, and place his own construction upon
them. Westoby had doubtless heard all the slanderous
gossip at Monte Carlo concerning her.</p>

<p>She might steel herself against slander but not against
the truth. She could not contradict the fact that
Westoby had given her ¬£250. Why? For acting as a
mascotte and enabling him to win ¬£500! Who would
believe such a fairy tale? Violetta went hot and
<pb n="189"/>
cold at the interpretation which the malicious might
put upon the transaction.</p>

<p><said aloud="false">I'll not be in his debt a moment longer than I can
help--even if it involves my disclosing that I'm the
tenant of the Owl's Nest. I'd rather that Westoby
did not know my address, but----</said></p>

<p>She stopped. The thought of another danger had
suddenly faced her. Westoby had probably made
himself intimately acquainted with Sir John Norman's
affairs. Supposing he knew that Norman owned the
Owl's Nest? What conclusion would he draw from the
fact that she was living there? Violetta had accepted
money from him, why shouldn't she accept the generosity
of Norman? Not, of course, as a mascotte--for Norman
had had anything but good luck--but for some other
reason.</p>

<p>The position was intolerable, and made all the more
so because she could for the moment see no way of
safely extricating herself.</p>

</div>


<div n="19" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XIX</head>
<head type="main">Ella Asserts Herself</head>

<p>Violetta was busily occupied in going through her
accounts. Her bets on Killarney figured largely in them.
She had won over ¬£500.</p>

<p><said aloud="false">That man must be paid back,</said> she decided. <said aloud="false">The
question is, how am I to get it to him? He shan't
come here, anyhow.</said></p>

<p>It seemed to be a case of the mountain going to
Mahomet. Unpleasant, but there was no alternative.
She meant Westoby to give her a receipt and that
receipt would have to state the circumstances under
which he paid her the money. There must be no mistake
about <emph>that.</emph></p>

<pb n="190"/>
<p>She had just locked up her books, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles
had entered to consult her as to lunch, when there came
the loud clang of the outer door bell, followed by an
imperious rat-tat of the knocker.</p>

<p>A visitor most certainly. Tradesmen announced
themselves in a much more modest way. Violetta
looked at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles looked at
her mistress.</p>

<p>For a minute or so Violetta's heart beats quickened.
Could the visitor be Lord Verschoyle? Hardly. He
would not have shown so much impatience and
pomposity.</p>

<p><said>Go and see who it is, Stubbles. If it be any stranger
be sure to ask their business. I'm not in a very good
humour this morning, and I don't feel inclined to be
bothered.</said></p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles was not disposed to offer any contradic-
tion. She had already noticed Violetta's mood. She
disappeared and Violetta sat expectantly. Once she
glanced at the mirror and then shrugged her shoulders
disdainfully at her involuntary lapse into feminine
weakness. The impression lurked in her mind that
after all it might be Lord Verschoyle.</p>

<p>She heard the tones of a high-pitched voice, and the
softer accents of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles in reply. There was
something in the strained note of the voice that seemed
familiar, but she could not fix it. Then the housekeeper
came into the room looking a little flurried.</p>

<p><said>A lady wants to see you, Miss.</said></p>

<p><said>Did you ask her name?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, yes. She said it didn't matter. She <emph>must</emph>
see you she said--quite snappy. She seems put out,
and nearly jumped down my throat.</said></p>

<p>This did not look promising.</p>

<p><said>I suppose you'd better show her in here, Stubbles.
Though I hate people who won't give their names.
They nearly always come on some unpleasant busi-
ness.</said></p>

<pb n="191"/>
<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles went off, and presently the door opened
and in walked Ella Norman, her nose in the air and a
spot of scarlet on each cheek. Violetta, who knew her
thoroughly, saw that she had worked herself into a
violent passion.</p>

<p><said>Well, upon my word,</said> burst out the young lady
as soon as her rage would enable her to speak. But she
could say no more.</p>

<p>Violetta looked at her steadily, and showed no signs
of trepidation. Indeed, she felt none. Ella had cer-
tainly taken her by surprise--that was all.</p>

<p><said>Why not sit down?</said> she remarked. <said>You might
find it easier to explain the object of your visit when
you're comfortable.</said></p>

<p>Violetta's manner and voice were the essence of
sweetness. It set Ella's passion seething.</p>

<p><said>The object of my visit? I should have thought
you'd have guessed it. I--I--aren't you ashamed of
yourself?</said> she almost screamed.</p>

<p><said>I don't think so. What have I to be ashamed of?
If that question is all that has brought you here, you
might have saved yourself the trouble.</said></p>

<p><said>I couldn't believe my ears when <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlowe told
me you were living here.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, what of it? I must live somewhere, I
suppose.</said></p>

<p><said>But why all this secrecy? Why didn't you write
to me?</said></p>

<p><said>Write to you? After you virtually turned me out
of your house? You're talking nonsense.</said></p>

<p><said>Nonsense? I consider your conduct disgraceful.
Simply shocking!</said></p>

<p><said>Does it matter what you think?</said></p>

<p><said>Answer me this--aren't you--what is the polite
term for a questionable connection--under John's
protection? I suppose you know what I mean?</said></p>

<p>Violetta's reply was to strike the alarm bell which was
on, the table. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles came in so quickly after
<pb n="192"/>
the summons that she must have been listening outside
the door.</p>

<p><said>Please show out this lady, Stubbles,</said> said Violetta,
coldly.</p>

<p><said>Well, of all the----</said></p>

<p><said>I've nothing to say to you. I refer you to <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Barlowe if you care to know what rent I pay.</said></p>

<p><said>Rent! I've no doubt you and my foolish brother
have managed the thing very nicely. I'm quite sure
the rent doesn't come out of <emph>your</emph> pocket.</said></p>

<p><said>The door, please, Stubbles.</said></p>

<p>Violetta rose without haste and walked towards the
French window which was open. Without another word
she went into the garden and left her visitor speechless
with indignation. When she had sufficiently recovered
herself she turned to the housekeeper.</p>

<p><said>Do you know Sir John Norman?</said> she demanded,
haughtily.</p>

<p><said>No, I don't,</said> retorted <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles, who was
nothing if not blunt.</p>

<p><said>I don't believe you. He comes here under another
name, most likely.</said></p>

<p><said>That's false, beggin' your pardon, ma'am.</said></p>

<p><said>Doesn't Miss Vaughan have a gentleman visitor ever?</said></p>

<p><said>I'm not here to answer impertinent questions. If
you want to know anything about Miss Vaughan you'd
better ask Miss Vaughan herself. So far as I'm con-
cerned, I may tell you that Miss Vaughan has no visitors,
man or woman. This is the way to the hall.</said></p>

<p>She opened the door and stood there, a sturdy janitor,
Ella would have dearly liked to vent her rage upon an
<soCalled>inferior,</soCalled> but she had sense enough to see that she
would get from this buxom independent domestic as
good as she gave, and perhaps better, so she pocketed
her wrath and marched out of the room. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles
followed her and shut the front door after her with a
slam which spoke volumes as to her sentiments. Then
she joined her mistress in the garden.</p>

<pb n="193"/>
<p><said>She's gone an' a good thing. Lor, what a wax she
was in,</said> exclaimed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles with a heave of her
ample bosom.</p>

<p>Violetta had her back turned to the woman. When
she wheeled round, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles saw that her eyes were
moist and shining.</p>

<p><said>Don't take on about her,</said> exclaimed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles
sympathisingly. <said>I'll warrant you gave her a dressin'
down or she wouldn't ha' been so wild. A regular
vixen <emph>I</emph> call her. But there--well, after it's all over
one can't help givin' way a bit. I s'pose we women
are built that way. Maybe it's all for the best.</said></p>

<p><said>I dare say. We won't talk any more about it,
Stubbles.</said></p>

<p>Violetta mopped up the betraying tears that stood in
her eyes. She was angry with herself for showing signs
that Ella's words had wounded her so much. She
wished <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles had not come upon her while
she was struggling with her emotion, but the woman
meant her intrusion kindly.</p>

<p><said>She wanted to pump me about you, Miss,</said> went on
the housekeeper, <said>but I wasn't taking any. Asked
me if Sir John Norman ever came to see you. Not
knowing nothing, I couldn't tell her nothing. What
I did say wasn't much short o' telling her she was a
liar.</said></p>

<p><said>That'll do. I don't want to hear any more,</said>
rejoined Violetta, a little chokingly.</p>

<p>Violetta had always prided herself upon her perfect
self control, but Ella's cruel insinuations were more than
she could bear, and for once she had broken down.
The ordeal had come upon her at a time when she was
least prepared for it. And the irony of the thing was
that the three men who had come into her life--Norman,
Lord Verschoyle and Dan Westoby--were nothing
to her.</p>

<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles wisely left her to herself, and after a
while she sat down upon a garden chair and allowed
<pb n="194"/>
the cool, fresh spring air and the bright sunshine to
restore her nerves.</p>

<p>In a way this came about, but the recollection of that
passage of arms--it had hardly lasted more than a couple
of minutes--still rankled.</p>

<p><said>I could have launched a bomb shell had I chosen,</said>
she thought. <said>I'm sure she doesn't know that John
Norman has a wife--and that wife the woman who
called herself <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willoughby Smythe. But it would
have been horridly mean of me to give the poor man
away.</said></p>

<p>Besides, it would have done her more harm than good.
It would have made it plain to Ella that John Norman
was thoroughly abandoned, and that she, Violetta
Vaughan, was quite aware of his supposed loose princi-
ples and had encouraged them. She quivered at the
thought of the story which a spiteful woman could
concoct on such a foundation.</p>

<p>As to her feelings towards John Norman, she could
hardly analyse them, had she cared to face the task.
She liked him as a companion. His amiability and
geniality could not be gainsaid. Violetta had a con-
siderable spice of romance about her--perhaps her
varied life had had much to do with it, so much of that
life had been unusual and sometimes she had seen
herself acting as his guardian angel--a r√¥le which most
women of good instincts love to play and well it is for
the world that it should be so--but why she should
have this desire she could not explain. It certainly
did not spring out of what is called love. And the
odd thing was that if one judged by what Sir John
Norman had done and left undone, it could hardly be
said he was worth the sacrifice that a woman would
make to ensure his happiness.</p>

<p>But Violetta now saw Norman by the light of de-
preciation. At the same time by contrast with the
self-indulgent and depraved men she had encountered,
he was almost perfection, though she was quite conscious
<pb n="195"/>
of his shortcomings. Hence, because of Norman's
harmlessness and because of her own desire, out of pure
friendliness, to extricate him from his embarrassments,
Ella's insinuations were doubly shameful and doubly
galling.</p>

<p>She began to think that in associating herself with
Norman by renting the Owl's Nest, she had made a
mistake. Their relations, purely those of landlord
and tenant, could be so easily misconstrued. Yet he
had never been near her--had never written her a
line. But who would believe it?</p>

<p><said>Well,</said> at last she exclaimed, <said>it's the old story, I
suppose. <q>Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow,
thou shalt not escape calumny.</q> Anyway, I'm too
deeply in with horses and racing to go back. And I
don't think I want to go back. I love horses. They're
honest and faithful. And they can't talk. After all,
what Ella chooses to say about me isn't of much con-
sequence. But she'll go for Sir John. Poor chap,
I'm sorry for him.</said></p>

<p>As far as calumny went, George Godfree and Dan
Westoby were much more to be feared than Ella Norman.</p>

<p>Violetta had half determined to go to Westoby that
very day and force him to accept the ¬£250, but after
what had happened her nerves were too strained.</p>

<p><said aloud="false">I must be at the very top of my form when I inter-
view that cold-blooded fellow,</said> was the conclusion
she came to, and hearing the housekeeper's summons
for lunch, she went into the house in much her usual
unruffled demeanour.</p>

<p>Violetta was quite right in foreshadowing a bad
quarter of an hour for John Norman. Ever since her
departure from Thames-side, relations between him
and his sister had been somewhat strained, but there
had not been anything like an open rupture.</p>

<p>Norman had long been chafing at his dependance upon
Ella. It was her money which paid the rent of The
Willows and kept the household going. When she
<pb n="196"/>
was in a bad temper she was not above reminding him
of his obligation to her. His enforced helplessness,
however, had had one good effect. It made him exert
himself, and he had succeeded in obtaining a Government
appointment which with economy (if he were capable
of such a virtue) would enable him to run his own
diggings. But with his temperamental inertness he
had put off announcing his intention.</p>

<p>Ella's return from her visit to the Owl's Nest and
the way she flew at him brought matters to a crisis.</p>

<p>Happily, or unhappily, he was in the mood to show
fight. Alf Richards as a detective had not turned
out a success. He had proved to be more like a sponge
than a 'tec. Money had the knack of slipping from
him--or into him, as it mostly disappeared in the shape
of whiskey--in the most aggravating fashion.</p>

<p>So far as any details as to Christine's mode of life
was concerned, he had plenty to say but the details
were repellant, and John Norman's sensitiveness
received a most disagreeable shock. No doubt, if
Richards was to be believed he would have no difficulty
in obtaining a divorce, but it meant descending into
a sordid story from which he shrank.</p>

<p>The worst point to Norman, however, was the fact
--again, if Richards spoke the truth--that the
man upon whom she bestowed her favours was George
Godfree. They were always together, reported
Richards. Not, said Alfred, always like turtle doves,
but more often like fighting cocks. But, considering
the tastes of both for champagne, whiskies and sodas,
and liqueurs, this mixture of moods was not surprising.</p>

<p>The upshot of the matter was that Norman had
determined upon dispensing with Alf's services, and
had told him on the very day of Ella's visit to the
Owl's Nest that he need not do any more detective
work, as he had got all the material he wanted and
more. He softened the blow by presenting <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Richards with a treasury note over and above his
<pb n="197"/>
weekly allowance, but the amateur detective went away
looking very gloomy.</p>

<p>That evening Norman came home to dinner in a very
distracted mood, and the angry look upon Ella's face
he never noticed. He sat down to the table without
a word, served the soup and the fish and still remained
silent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ella was fretting and fuming. She was
burning for him to give her an opening for unburdening
her soul, but she had no chance. Not that she could
have launched her grievance while the parlour maid was
hovering round, but she could have delivered some
irritating shafts apropos of nothing in particular and
so relieved her overcharged feelings.</p>

<p>At last she could bear the restraint no longer.</p>

<p><said>What a cheerful companion you are, John,</said> she
broke out. <said>You sit there solemn as an owl.</said></p>

<p><said>I've nothing to say,</said> he rejoined curtly.</p>

<p><said>No? Doesn't the reference to the owl stimulate
you?</said></p>

<p>Ella had got in one shot. She thought it remarkably
apt.</p>

<p><said>I don't know what you're talking about.</said></p>

<p><said>Really? I should have thought the association
of ideas would have suggested something pleasant.</said></p>

<p><said>It doesn't suggest anything at all. You're talking
in riddles. I hate riddles.</said></p>

<p>Ella gave him an acid smile.</p>

<p><said>Very well. I'll give you the answer when we're
by ourselves.</said></p>

<p>Shot number two. Norman had afforded her the
chance she wanted but for the moment she would
hold her hand.</p>

<p>The dinner over, Norman lit a cigar and was about
to retire to his room when his sister held up her hand.</p>

<p><said>Stay a moment, John, I want to talk to you. Do
sit down. I can't say what's in my mind while you're
wandering about like a wild beast at the Zoo.</said></p>

<pb n="198"/>
<p>John did not look particularly well pleased, and he
threw himself into a chair with an air of resignation.</p>

<p><said>What's it all about?</said></p>

<p><said>The answer to what you were pleased to call my
riddle.</said></p>

<p><said>Bother your riddle. Do for once talk sense.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, you shall have sense enough, my boy, I promise
you. I only said one of two words at dinner--owl--
and you did not understand, or pretended you didn't.
Had I said <q>Owl's Nest</q> it would, I fancy, have gone
home. Ha, ha!</said></p>

<p>There was something ominous in Ella's assumption
of hilarity, obviously forced. John Norman shrugged
his shoulders and made no reply.</p>

<p><said>I've been to Owl's Nest to-day.</said></p>

<p>In spite of himself Norman started. He knew now
what was in his sister's mind.</p>

<p><said>How nicely you've laid your heads together so that
I shouldn't know what you and that woman were up to.</said></p>

<p>A much milder tempered man than John Norman
would have been roused by Ella's offensive words,
accentuated as they were by her still more offensive
manner.</p>

<p><said>And what <emph>have</emph> we been up to?</said> he retorted,
flushing angrily.</p>

<p><said>Don't try to put me off, please, because you won't.
I'm not a child. I suppose I know what the scandalous
business means. I'm not surprised that you wanted
to keep me in the dark. Of course, you've a right to do
as you like, but if you must mix yourself up in a dis-
graceful intrigue you might have had the decency
to keep your property out of it. I'm told that such
immoral arrangements as you have made with a woman,
who's little more than an adventuress, are common
enough in the West end of London. In the circles of
vice one expects----</said></p>

<p>Norman sprang to his feet. He had fairly boiled
over.</p>

<pb n="199"/>
<p><said>Hold your tongue,</said> he shouted. <said>What you've
just said is a tissue of false slanderous assertions. I'll
listen to no more of them.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I know the truth is always unpleasant. Do
you deny that you're paying for the keep of Violetta
Vaughan--that it is into her pocket that your money
goes--that in short, she is your--mistress?</said></p>

<p>Ella uttered the last word with a great effort, as though
it were something that contaminated her lips. Her
face wore such a look of horror that had her brother
not been in such a towering passion, it must have struck
him as extremely comical.</p>

<p><said>I deny every one of your libels.</said></p>

<p><said>Of course you do. But you can't deceive me.
The woman had very little money when she came to
stay here. I saw evident signs of luxury where she
is now. I noticed a horse in the stables--a sort of
poultry farm in miniature--a couple of servants. She
can't keep up an establishment of that kind on nothing.
Where does her money come from, I ask you?</said></p>

<p><said>And you may ask. I know no more about Miss
Vaughan's affairs than you do. Indeed, I should say
<emph>I</emph> know less, for <emph>you've</emph> visited her and <emph>I</emph> haven't.</said></p>

<p><said>What does that matter? No doubt you had her
<emph>reputation</emph> to consider. It is so easy--to meet in town.</said></p>

<p>Norman quivered with rage. He could not believe
that his prim sister could say such things.</p>

<p><said>Infamous,</said> he cried. <said>You talked just now about
West end vice. It seems to me that you know as
much about it as any woman needs to know if she has
use for it.</said></p>

<p>It was Ella who was now in a paroxysm of rage, and
when she was in this mood her speech inclined to that
of the melodrama.</p>

<p><said>If anybody had told me you would have used such
vile language to your own flesh and blood, I--I would
have struck the base slanderer to the earth,</said> she screamed
hysterically.</p>

<pb n="200"/>
<p><said>You brought it on yourself. I told you to hold
your tongue. As it is, we've only succeeded in irritating
one another. I can see but one thing left for me to do,
and that is to leave you to run this show by yourself.
We can't meet with any degree of satisfaction after
to-night,</said> said Norman, cooling down.</p>

<p><said>I quite agree, and I hope you'll go as soon as possible.
It's what I would have proposed but I didn't want you
to spread it abroad that I'd turned you out. I may
say that I contemplate certain changes here, and now
that you've plunged into what the dear vicar calls an
irregular life, your presence here would be most em-
barrassing both for him and for me.</said></p>

<p>Ella's emotional temperament permitted her to pass
from one mood to another with lightning rapidity. Her
fit of highflown indignation had disappeared, and she
now spoke with quite an air of relief.</p>

<p>John Norman stared, much puzzled by her announce-
ment.</p>

<p><said>The dear vicar! What the deuce has the dear vicar
got to do with it? I don't see where he comes in.</said></p>

<p><said>Then I'll tell you. I'm going to marry him.</said></p>

<p><said>What, have you chucked young Percival?</said></p>

<p><said>Pray don't use such vulgar expression. I've
<soCalled>chucked</soCalled> as you're pleased to term it, nobody. I
was never engaged to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Percival.</said></p>

<p><said>Weren't you? I thought you and he had fixed up
matters. But it's no affair of mine. You can marry
whom you please and do as you like. I presume I'm
entitled to the same liberty.</said></p>

<p>Now that they had spoken their minds Norman in
his new found energy determined to start upon his
fresh path in life at once.</p>

<p>That night brother and sister parted coldly polite
to each other, and Norman put up at the Great Western
Hotel until he could secure a suitable rest for the sole
of his foot.</p>

<p>He began to realise the true cause of Ella's disposition
<pb n="201"/>
to treat him as a sort of pariah. She was eaten up by
the canker of <soCalled>respectability,</soCalled> and her marriage to a
parson would set its seal upon her destiny. Norman
was inclined to laugh when he thought what she would
have said had she known about Christine!</p>

<p><said>There's something going on at Gumley's that I

deliberate manner.</p>

<p><said>Not so easy, old man,</said> rejoined the Honourable

since the Two Thousand, Peter's put on a double set
of watchers, and I tell you straight, Dan, they're not
to be got at.</said></p>

<p><said>Exactly, and that's why I want to find out Peter's
game.</said></p>

<p>Westoby and George Godfree were seated at luncheon
in the stately dining-room of Normanhurst. It was
much the same as Sir John had left it for Westoby
had bought the furniture as well as the mansion and
park.</p>

<p>The bookmaker had an idea that when he became a
landed proprietor the gentry would receive him on equal
terms. He had been bitterly disappointed. He had
been snubbed all round. He could not even obtain
the distinction of being <choice><corr>made a</corr><orig>a made</orig></choice> J.P. Except the
satisfaction of having dragged down the man he hated,
he had derived no pleasure from being the owner of
Normanhurst.</p>

<p>Perhaps had he flung his money about he would have
<pb n="202"/>
been more successful, but fits of meanness kept his
purse strings tightly tied. He knew the hangers-on
of the turf too well to make friends of them They
were useful to him and that was all. George Godfree
was an exception, but that was because of Godfree's
family connections, and because he had been born a
gentleman and could call himself the Honourable George.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Westoby was a solitary man, and
he had begun to find Normanhurst a bore and a white
elephant. The upkeep of the place was a financial
burden without much compensation. He had occasional
thoughts of selling the property but this would have
been an admission of defeat, which for the moment
he did not feel inclined to face.</p>

<p>But since the Two Thousand he had discovered a
reason why he should hold on. A dream was hovering
about his brain. He was thinking of it now, but ap-
parently the mystery of Peter Gumley's extra pre-
cautions was the only thing that occupied him.</p>

<p><said>Peter's game's a deep one, you may bet your bottom
dollar on that, Dan,</said> said Godfree, frowning. <said>I
guess Lord Verschoyle keeps a tight hand over him.
It was Verschoyle who insisted upon Gumley firing
Parsons and all the gang. He's got to know something.</said></p>

<p><said>What's the meaning of Gumley taking on that boy
Tim Hollis again?</said> said Westoby abruptly. <said>He
was one of the old gang, wasn't he?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, he was and he wasn't,</said> rejoined Godfree
with a short laugh. <said>Barney Moss got hold of him,
it's true, but he was rather a difficult fish to play. If
he hadn't been rubbed the wrong way by Peter he
wouldn't have opened his mouth; as it was, Barney
had precious little out of him.</said></p>

<p><said>Seen Parsons lately?</said></p>

<p><said>Yesterday. He's always hanging about the Barley
Mow. Seems in low water.</said></p>

<p><said>So much the better. No love lost between him and
Gumley, eh!</said></p>

<pb n="203"/>
<p><said>Not as much as a bee's knee.</said></p>

<p><said>And I should think he ought to know the ins and outs
of Holberry Down at his fingers' ends, You must work
him, George. We must see the next trial spin. If
Killarney loses the Derby it'll about sew me up. But
he can't lose with Tom Allworth on his back.</said></p>

<p><said>What! do you mean to say you've backed him?</said>
cried Godfree.</p>

<p><said>Yes, why not? I suppose it's open to me to
back a horse as well as take odds against him?</said></p>

<p><said>I don't deny it. But it's not like you. I've heard
you say that if it weren't for the jugginses backing
horses the bookies couldn't live.</said></p>

<p><said>And I still say it. But once in a way a juggins
pulls it off. Killarney's a dead cert. Why shouldn't
I take advantage of it? It's my whim, so shut up.</said></p>

<p>Godfree shrugged his shoulders and veered round to
his patron's way of thinking that Quicksand's form at
Newmarket was but a fluke.</p>

<p><said>At the same time, governor, if Tom Allworth hadn't
been on Killarney I do believe Quicksand would have
beaten him.</said></p>

<p><said>And so do I. That's where the devil interfered.
You hadn't got your ears and eyes open, George.</said></p>

<p><said>How the dickens could we tell Verschoyle was going
to put up Tom Allworth at the last moment? Quick-
sand beat him when the two were tried together.</said></p>

<p><said>Barney Moss got that bit of news for us, didn't he?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, and he was well paid for it. He must have
known more than he told us, the sneak. He and his
crown backed Killarney for all they were worth. We
were nearly sold.</said></p>

<p><said>Mind it doesn't happen again, George. We'll see
Gumley's next trial with our own eyes. Parsons must
manage it for us. Enough of this. What about the
girl we saw with Verschoyle? Found out anything
about her?</said></p>

<p>Godfrey eyed his patron closely. He was wondering
<pb n="204"/>
why Westoby took so much interest in Violetta. The
bookmaker was as a rule quite indifferent to women.
His ideas about them on the few occasions when he
talked on the subject were not elevating. He regarded
women as created to squeeze what she could out of man.
She would, he held, get anything to benefit herself
whether in the way of her pocket or of her personal
adornment. Judging from his experience of the
majority of women whose acquaintance he had made
on the race course possibly he was right.</p>

<p>His sentiments were perfectly well known to George
Godfrey and the latter could not conceive Dan regarding
Violetta in any other light than as a woman to be
bought. Whether this was so or not didn't matter a
rap to the Honourable George. His game was to
make his services useful. If Dan Westoby paid him well,
and he was able at the same time to indulge his spite
against Violetta, he would have a double satisfaction.</p>

<p><said>Have I found out anything about her? My dear
chap, there's precious little I don't know, excepting
perhaps what she did during the time she was in France.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, you hinted as much before,</said> rejoined Westoby,
impatiently. <said>Have you found out where she's living?
That's the point.</said></p>

<p>George Godfree's blood-shot eyes glinted maliciously.</p>

<p><said>Quite so. It's a bit of a find and I guess you'll
open your eyes when I tell you. It cost me a fiver to
oil the tongues of the gossips at the Barley Mow.</said></p>

<p><said>The Barley Mow! What the devil's the Barley
Mow got to do with her?</said></p>

<p><said>Simply this. She's living at the Owl's Nest, and
her place isn't two miles from the pub. There's nothing
the loafers of the bar parlour like better than to chew
over the bits of scandal about the <soCalled>Quality.</soCalled></said></p>

<p><said>Well.</said></p>

<p><said>What they don't know they invent, and, by Jove,
a story in their mouths doesn't lose by telling. The
tale is that Sir John Norman, once my old pal, set her
<pb n="205"/>
up there and is looking after her welfare. The Owl's
Nest belongs to Norman, you know.</said></p>

<p><said>I didn't know--curse him.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, it does, and a snugger cage for a pretty bird
it would be difficult to find.</said></p>

<p>Westoby's lips tightened and his nostrils twitched.
Godfree watched him narrowly.</p>

<p><said>From what I know of her past and present I should
say that there's a lot of truth at the bottom of the story.
The Hebe of the buffet in a club where some of the
rowdiest boys on the turf were to be seen, isn't likely
to be very particular. But, touching Norman. By a
stroke of luck, Christine, who's the cleverest of devils
when she keeps from the cham. and chartreuse, came
across both her and Norman when she was doing the
spiritualistic fake and the Christian Science wheeze,
and making a good thing out of both. It was at Thames-
side, up the river, and she got taken up by the vicar,
till he was told something about her that made him
drop poor Christine like a hot <choice><corr>potato</corr><orig>potatoe</orig></choice>. It's as good
as a play to hear her take off his reverence--</said></p>

<p><said>That'll do. I don't want to hear about Christine.
I know all her doings.</said></p>

<p><said>Do you? I doubt it,</said> returned Godfree, with a
hoarse laugh. <said>She wants a bit of knowing. Anyhow,
she figures in the story. She was invited to a seance
at a riverside villa where Norman and his sister were
living, and while she was there Norman and Violetta
Vaughan came back from a motor joy ride. They'd
been out all day it appeared. Norman's sister, who is
a bit of a spitfire, was in a rare wax. Christine learned
that the next day she packed off Violetta bag and
baggage. Of course, Norman was on the job, and
that was how she comes to be living in that secluded
shanty of his, the Owl's Nest.</said></p>

<p>Westoby's face became harder and harder as he
listened to this recital of facts ornamented by fictional
conclusions.</p>

<pb n="206"/>
<p><said>How came she to be gadding about at Newmarket
with Verschoyle?</said> he burst out.</p>

<p><said>Ask me another, my dear chap. You're not a baby
in the ways of women. Draw your own inferences, and
while you're doing that draw me a cheque. I guess
I've made the way easy for you. It's half the battle
when you know the sort of woman you're after. Five
tens wouldn't hurt you. I wasn't bound to tell you
anything, you know. Dirty work ought to be well paid.</said></p>

<p>Westoby pulled out his cheque book and wrote a
cheque for the desired amount.</p>

<p><said>There you are, Judas,</said> he hissed.</p>

<p>Godfree laughed. He was used to Westoby's ways.</p>

<p><said>Get on now to Parsons and don't mess the thing
up,</said> snarled Westoby.</p>

<p>The tone and manner were those of a master to a
servant, and the Honourable George's face momentarily
flushed. But he dared not resent the book-maker's
contempt and tyranny.</p>

<p>Three days went over. Violetta, by sheer force of
will, had recovered her equanimity. Had she chosen
to dwell upon her disappointments she would have been
thoroughly miserable. She had half hoped that Lord
Verschoyle would have been tempted to call, but he
came not.</p>

<p><said>Why should he? You're a fool to think he would
after seeing that choice sample of my acquaintances.
He must be feeling jolly glad I didn't accept his promised
invitation to his mother's dinner party. I suppose I
shall be honoured with a distant bow if I should chance
to meet him with any of his relations, and with a sort
of patronising familiarity if he should be alone. That's
how men treat women who've gone down in their esti-
mation. I've seen that kind of thing over and over
again.</said></p>


<p>Immediately after pronouncing this judgment she
was inclined to make a reservation in favour of his
lordship. In whatever he did he would be a gentleman.</p>

<pb n="207"/>
<p>As for Norman, his silence had first surprised and
then slightly angered her. Having taken her fully
into confidence, he had dropped her. Why? She
could find no reason, but after Ella's base insinuations
she was glad he had never written nor sought to see
her. No one who knew the facts could cast a stone
either at her or him.</p>

<p>But, as she thought, with a shrug of the shoulders,
what do facts matter where scandalous tongues are
at work?</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that Norman had to a certain extent
dropped out of her dreams of the future, the sudden
appearance of Dan Westoby and his identity with
the man of her <q>mascotte</q> days impressed her strangely,
and brought to life the romanticism of her nature.
It had once pleased her to let her fancy rove in the
regions of the ideal when she saw herself the central
figure of a story which was to have a happy ending in
restoring to Norman his ancestral house. She did not
know exactly how this was to be done, and Norman
himself had rather knocked the bottom out of her
fanciful weavings by his confession. Of late she had
ceased to speculate about him and herself--save on
one point.</p>

<p>That point was closely allied to her romanticism.
She had never cast aside the impression that she brought
good luck to other people. Though she had ceased
to be a <q>mascotte,</q> she still believed in her powers.
As she had at Monte Carlo told the man who had proved
to be Dan Westoby, she had not the slightest idea why
she should possess this occult influence. All she could
say was that such was the fact.</p>

<p>And with this conviction firmly fixed in her mind, she
had governed all her speculative plunges by the idea
that she was acting for Norman and not for herself.
It might be said to be a species of self delusion, but
whether or not she had hitherto not had a failure.
Of course, she herself would benefit by her successes, but
<pb n="208"/>
this was a minor consideration. She had as a Monte
Carlo <q>mascotte</q> steadily refused anything but a fair
remuneration and she would continue to do so. It
was no doubt a <q>fad,</q> but <q>fads</q> have a strange
individualistic influence incapable of explanation.</p>

<p>The startling entry of Westoby into her life had
made a considerable difference in her views. She now
had a strange personal interest in wresting Normanhurst
from the man who had deposed its rightful owner.
She had no cause for hating Westoby, it was purely the
antagonism she felt against him. But with Violetta this
was quite enough.</p>

<p>So it came about that the sympathy with Norman
and her desire to help him receded into the background,
and a yearning to pit herself against Westoby occupied
the first place.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, Violetta felt that for the moment
she had not nerve enough to take the bold step of
calling on Westoby. She had worked herself up into
hating the man, but neither his questionable reputation
nor his intimacy with her avowed enemy George Godfree
had anything to do with that hatred. The cause was
something which worked upon her indignation and
galled her to the quick. She knew that her character
and much of her past were in his hands. And she
felt helpless.</p>

<p>Violetta brooded over the position until it began to
dash her spirits, and she felt the want of some mental
tonic. It came in the shape of a note from Peter
Gumley, which arrived by post.</p>

<p><q>Dear Miss Vaughan,</q> he wrote. <q>I should much
like you to see the horses run. I'm going to have a
trial--at night. I've reason to believe that spies are
about, so I send this by post instead of messenger,
who might be watched. To-morrow night the moon
will be at the full, and if the present weather continues
it ought to be almost as light as day. Come over
about nine. I shouldn't ride if I were you, nor travel
<pb n="209"/>
direct. Take a roundabout route. We can't be too
careful. All going well. Yours respectfully, Peter
Gumley.</q></p>

<p>Violetta felt a strange sense of elation. Here was
something to fight against. The prospect of a battle
of wits always put her in a good humour. She carried
out Gumley's instructions to the letter.</p>

<p>A few fleecy clouds flecked the sky when Violetta
reached the trainer's house. Gumley was awaiting
her. There was a shade of anxiety in his face.</p>

<p><said>Are you sure you weren't dogged?</said> said he.</p>

<p><said>Quite sure--that is to say, I saw no one at all
suspicious. I set out from my place as if I weren't
coming here. I came round by Normanhurst.</said></p>

<p><said>That was rather risky, wasn't it?</said></p>

<p><said>No. I thought it was the best thing. If you're in
any fear of Westoby's people they'd hardly think I
should go in his direction.</said></p>

<p><said>Perhaps you're right. What troubles me is that
blackguard Parsons. He's been nosing about here these
last two or three days. Anyway, all is in readiness,
so come along.</said></p>

<p>The two went into the paddock. The horses were
out for a gentle walk to stretch their legs previous to
the trial. There they were, the three beauties,--
Killarney, Quicksand, and Belphegor. Violetta's heart
bounded when she saw how the action and bearing of
her favourite had improved.</p>

<p><said>Oh, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley, how splendid he looks!</said> she
cried enthusiastically.</p>

<p><said>Aye, and I'll go bail his running will be just as
good.</said></p>

<p><said>Who's up?</said></p>

<p><said>Tim, of course. I wouldn't trust any other boy
on his back.</said></p>

<p><said>That's right. Who'll ride Killarney--I mean for
the Derby? Tom Allworth, I suppose.</said></p>

<pb n="210"/>
<p><said>Yes, Tom's booked for the Derby, but for the
moment it's a dead secret.</said></p>

<p><said>Where does to-night's run end?</said></p>

<p><said>At yonder post. Wait here and see 'em come in.</said></p>

<p>Violetta purposely avoided making herself known
either to Tim or to Belphegor. She wanted the trial
to be carried out fairly and squarely on its merits.</p>

<p>The horses were walked to the starting place, and
Gumley's head groom set them going. Violetta and
the old trainer watched and waited.</p>

<p>It was an exciting struggle, and to Violetta all the
more so because of the solitude and silence. There
was no bustle, no roar of a <choice><corr>tumultuous</corr><orig>tumultous</orig></choice> crowd, no buzz
of tongues to relieve the strain on the nerves.</p>

<p>Soon the quick sullen thud of hoofs became distinctly
audible. Violetta, looking direct at the advancing
horses, could not determine which was ahead. They
seemed to be in a cluster. Gumley's more experienced
eyes, however, told him that Killarney was a little in
front, and he said so.</p>

<p><said>But that means nothing,</said> he added. <said>They're
only through the first half of the spin. The last bit
will tell. It's a little uphill.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, if only Belphegor puts out all his strength!</said>
cried Violetta, clasping her hands. <said>He's got it in
him, I'm sure.</said></p>

<p><said>I'll go bail Tim'll see to that. I never see a boy so
wrapped up in a horse. They're pals, and that's a
fact.</said></p>

<p>On they came. At three hundred yards or so from
the post they were level, and at a hundred yards Bel-
phegor began to draw away from his companions. He
gradually drew ahead and won by a length. It was a
dead heat between Killarney and Quicksand.</p>

<p>Violetta rushed to Belphegor, stroked his nose and
caressed his neck. The horse knew her. Then she held
out her hand to Tim, whose eyes glistened.</p>

<p><said>I knowed he'd do it, miss, when he'd got fair play,</said>
<pb n="211"/>
gasped Tim, who was breathless with exertion and
excitement.</p>

<p><said>Yes, and he must do it again at the Derby,</said> said
she.</p>

<p><said>You bet he will if I'm on him.</said></p>

<p>Violetta turned to Gumley.</p>

<p><said>What will Lord Verschoyle say to this, Peter?</said></p>

<p><said>It's a bit awkward. He's pretty deep in with
Killarney, though I warned him the Derby wouldn't
be the sure thing the Two Thou, was.</said></p>

<p><said>Did you say anything about Belphegor?</said></p>

<p><said>No; I wasn't confident about him or about Tim
either. He's come along wonderful since then.</said></p>

<p>Violetta was silent for a few minutes. Then she
looked up with a shade of vexation in her voice.</p>

<p><said>I wish you'd invited Lord Verschoyle to-night.
He ought to have seen the trial considering he's so
interested in it. It would have been playing the game,
wouldn't it?</said></p>

<p><said>I suppose it would,</said> rejoined Gumley with an
apologetic cough. <said>But I didn't know how you'd
take it.</said></p>

<p><said>How I'd take it? Why on earth should I object?</said></p>

<p><said>Well, you see, Miss, the thing had to be kept so
close on account of Dan Westoby.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, I know, but Lord Verschoyle's a gentleman.
He's to be trusted.</said></p>

<p><said>Of course--of course. Anyhow, the thing's done
and can't be undone.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes it can. You must let Lord Verschoyle know
as soon as possible. Remember, I insist upon it.</said></p>

<p>Gumley was a little puzzled over Violetta's manifesta-
tion of feeling. And; indeed, Violetta herself was
puzzled. It seemed to her, however, that as things had
turned out, it might be said that she had been con-
spiring with Peter Gumley against his lordship. But
had Belphegor failed, what then? It was a point she
could not decide off-hand.</p>

<pb n="212"/>
<p><said>How does the betting on Belphegor stand?</said> said
she.</p>

<p><said>Ten to one. The bookmakers want less odds.
Before the Two Thou, you could have got twenty to one.</said></p>

<p><said>I did,</said> rejoined Violetta quietly.</p>

<p>The trainer gave a long whistle.</p>

<p><said>Up to how much?</said></p>

<p><said>A ¬£100.</said></p>

<p><said>Who's the man who took you?</said></p>

<p><said>Dan Westoby. I chose him purposely. The bet's
not in my name. I booked it through my old friend,
William Burrup.</said></p>

<p><said>H'm. If Dan Westoby knew of to-night's result
he'd say his ¬£2,000 was as good as gone.</said></p>

<p><said>I suppose he'd get it back and more by Killarney
losing. Killarney's hot favourite just now.</said></p>

<p><said>That's so. But he wouldn't be if this trial gets
talked about. I've done my level best to keep every-
thing as close as wax, but stable secrets have a nasty
way of oozing out.</said></p>

<p><said>I might get on the first thing to-morrow at ten
to one,</said> said Violetta, reflecting.</p>

<p><said>You might.</said></p>

<p><said>I happen to know Burrup's in town. I shall go
to London to-night and see him. Shall I put a bit
on for you?</said></p>

<p><said>No; that would never do. It would upset the
show if it were known that I was booking bets.</said></p>

<p><said>I should take care it wasn't known but please
yourself. Good-night, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley. If I hurry I shall
just catch the next train.</said></p>

<p>She sped away, and the old trainer's looks followed
her. Scratching his chin, the while he muttered:</p>

<p><said>Mercy on me, when a woman takes on a hobby,
whether its horses or anything else, she goes the whole
hog. What did she pick out Westoby for?</said></p>

<p>Peter couldn't answer the question and he didn't try.
He could only shake his head.</p>

<pb n="213"/>
<p><said>The gell may be right, but----</said> well, there was a
volume in that <q>but.</q></p>

</div>


<div n="21" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XXI</head>
<head type="main">Quits!</head>

<p>As Peter feared, somebody in his establishment said
<q>something.</q> Belphegor's price suddenly went from
ten to one to five to one. The favourite stood at three
to one. On the morning of the third day after the
trial spin, Peter had a visit from Dan Westoby. The
trainer received the bookmaker civilly but coldly.</p>

<p><said>I've called to see you, Gumley, about that tricky
horse of yours, Belphegor,</said> said Westoby, going straight
to the point, as was his wont. <said>Some six months
ago you offered him to me at my own price.</said></p>

<p><said>Aye, and you refused a deal.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, I've altered my mind. Name your figure.</said></p>

<p><said>Can't be done, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Westoby. The matter's out
of my hands.</said></p>

<p><said>What do you mean?</said></p>

<p><said>I mean that I've sold the horse.</said></p>

<p><said>You might have given me the chance, anyway,</said>
said Westoby, his brows contracting.</p>

<p><said>You had the chance, Sir, and you let it slip.</said></p>

<p>Westoby inwardly was raging, but his habitual self-
command concealed any outward expression beyond a
tightening of the thin lips.</p>

<p><said>Who's bought the brute?</said> said he, after a pause.</p>

<p><said>Man named Humphries took a fancy to him, and
naming me a fair price, I closed with his offer.</said></p>

<p><said>Humph. Who's this Humphries? Where's he to
be found?</said></p>

<p><said>That's my business, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Westoby.</said></p>

<pb n="214"/>
<p><said>Very well. I'll make it mine, too.</said></p>

<p><said>You can do as you like about it.</said></p>

<p>Dan Westoby said no more. The parting between
him and Peter verged upon the hostile.</p>

<p>The bookmaker had been ill-served by George Godfree.
Of course there was a woman at the bottom of the
matter--Violetta, though in a roundabout way. The
¬£50 which Godfree had extracted from Westoby for
telling him where Violetta might be found was the
Honourable George's undoing.</p>

<p>The trial spin had come off on the very night George
received his instructions and the cheque. Godfree
had got on the track of Parsons, who in some mysterious
way had had the tip concerning Belphegor's wonderful
running. Parsons parted with the secret for a fiver,
and told Godfree something besides which had he but
known was worth as much more. Godfree could not
see that the information would lose anything by his
keeping it to himself for twenty-four hours, and burning
for a night's debauch went off to London for that purpose.</p>

<p>Full of importance, George, saturated with champagne
and brandy, let out to his pals a good deal of what he
knew, and in a wonderfully short time the result was
seen in the rapid shortening of the odds, greatly to
Westoby's bewilderment. Godfree's night of dissipation
required a day for recovery, and forty-eight hours
went over before he saw Westoby and told him what
had happened. But he said not a word about the
other item of gossip which Parsons had mentioned.
This item was that Belphegor had been in Violetta's
possession for a short time. Parsons could not explain
why, but he imagined that Violetta, having succeeded
in soothing the horse's savage temper, had had him
in her keeping to complete the cure. The important
fact that he did not know, was that she had bought the
horse.</p>

<p>Westoby was maddened by the news. Violetta had
completely mystified him. He had never forgotten
<pb n="215"/>
her success as a <q>mascotte.</q> He had found out that
she had backed Killarney for the Two Thou., and he had
no doubt she would follow her luck and back him also
for the Derby. Some curious superstitious feeling
had led him to alter his tactics, and he had involved
himself heavily in his support of the favourite. Violetta
had once brought off a coup in his favour. Why
shouldn't she do it again?</p>

<p>The unexpected issue of the trial spin had altered
everything. If Belphegor won the Derby he was a
broken man. In addition to backing Killarney, he
had accepted the odds against Belphegor, and he stood
to lose both ways if Belphegor won. The Derby Day
was so close that there was little chance of his hedging
successfully. The racing public had gone mad over
Killarney and Belphegor, and would hardly look at
any of the other entries.</p>

<p>Westoby returned to Normanhurst much perturbed,
even agitated. It was a new sensation for a man who
had always believed in his iron nerves. For the first
time in his life his brain refused to grapple with the
complicated process of <soCalled>making a book.</soCalled> Moreover,
he was beset by the constantly recurring image of
Violetta Vaughan. She intruded into his thoughts.
He took up his betting book, and threw it down im-
patiently. He glanced through the latest racing odds
in that morning's sporting paper, the figures danced
before his eyes.</p>

<p><said>Curse the jade,</said> he muttered. <said>Who the devil
is she acting for? Norman or Verschoyle?</said></p>

<p>Westoby had been the clever show mathematical
boy of his grammar school. He was the <soCalled>lightning
calculator,</soCalled> who astonished the examiners. He had
on leaving school entered a stockbroker's office and
was found a treasure by his employer. He could reel
off the fluctuating quotations of the day with an accuracy
and a nicety of fractional details truly marvellous. His
cold temperament remained undisturbed by women.
<pb n="216"/>
But there must have been something in his frigidity
and air of composed masterfulness which had their
influence on the emotional Alice Forbes, the stock-
broker's daughter. He cared nothing for her, but he
saw his way to his own advancement if the father
consented to receive him as a son-in-law.</p>

<p>Westoby had no notion of a secret marriage, and
he coolly broached the subject to the stockbroker. The
latter was highly indignant, and informed his pre-
sumptuous clerk that he intended his daughter to marry
Sir John Norman, one of his best clients--indeed,
the matter was practically settled. He wound up by
suggesting the advisability of Westoby transferring
his services elsewhere to prevent embarrassment.</p>

<p>Westoby, of course, knew Norman and had always
disliked him for no reasons other than envy and an-
tagonism. Norman's easy well-bred manner was such
a contrast to his own. Added to this, was the convic-
tion that he could never acquire the air of a gentle-
man.</p>

<p>He went out of Forbes' office hating Norman with
all the venom of a malignant nature. He made a
lucky <soCalled>plunge,</soCalled> became a member of the Stock Ex-
change--and then his luck turned. He was <soCalled>ham-
mered,</soCalled> turned outside broker, engaged in some shady
transaction, vanished for a year or two and reappeared
as a successful <soCalled>bookie.</soCalled> Eventually, as we know,
his chance came to revenge himself upon Sir John
Norman.</p>

<p>Abstemious by temperament and system, he had
not the relief in stimulants which on occasions most men
seek. Teetotalism may tend to affect the brain as
injuriously as excess. Westoby thought that abstention
from alcohol kept his mind clear. He forgot that the
mind depends upon the nerves. Just now his nervous
system was in a tumult, and he paced the room a prey
to intense vexation and chagrin.</p>

<p>A rap came at the door. A servant entered. A lady
<pb n="217"/>
had called, said the maid. She wanted to see <abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Westoby on business.</p>

<p><said>Who is she? What's her name?</said> he rapped out.</p>

<p><said>Wouldn't tell me, sir. I asked her.</said></p>

<p>Westoby was silent for a moment. He decided that
whoever the visitor might be he would see her. She
would distract his thoughts and that was what at
that moment he wanted most.</p>

<p>The servant ushered in the visitor--Violetta.</p>

<p>Westoby stared at her blankly. She looked in-
finitely more attractive in her well-fitting sober toned
dress than she did in the butterfly costume suitable
to Monte Carlo.</p>

<p><said>You,</said> he faltered. <said>Pray sit down.</said></p>

<p>Scarcely knowing what he said or did, he moved a
chair towards her. She took no notice.</p>

<p><said>The business that has brought me here, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Westoby,
won't take two minutes. I want to return the ¬£250
I received from you at Monte Carlo. Will you count
the notes and see that they are correct?</said></p>

<p><said>No, I won't,</said> he returned, brusquely. <said>The
money's yours. It was fairly earned. I'll not take it.</said></p>

<p><said>That's a matter of indifference to me. I shall
leave it all the same. I wish you good morning.</said></p>

<p>She laid the notes on the table, and turned to quit
the room.</p>

<p><said>Stop,</said> he shouted. <said>You're not going like that.
You've no right. I've done you no injury. I've never
offended you so far as I can tell. If I have, I apologise.
Just think. We parted as strangers, but now that I
know who you are and you know me, the thing's different.
I want an explanation.</said></p>

<p><said>Of what?</said></p>

<p><said>Why you bring me these notes with an air as though
they were contaminated.</said></p>

<p><said>It's my whim. I've nothing more to say,</said> she
returned steadily.</p>

<p><said>But <emph>I</emph> have, and you must listen. It's only fair.</said></p>

<pb n="218"/>
<p>A qualm of conscience seized Violetta. There was
reason in what he said. He had done her no wrong,
but she hated to be under an obligation to him.</p>

<p><said>Do you remember the offer of partnership I made
you at Monte Carlo?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes. My answer was no.</said></p>

<p><said>Exactly, but at that time you did not know me.
It did not occur to you that this place--Normanhurst
--was mine.</said></p>

<p><said>What of that?</said></p>

<p><said>I offer it to you now. I should fancy it was pref-
erable to the Owl's Nest. Aren't you tired of that
weak-kneed Norman?</said></p>

<p>He thought to surprise her. She heard him quite
composedly.</p>

<p><said>May I ask you what you mean?</said></p>

<p><said>Bah! You know quite well. From what I hear,
you've thrown him over for Lord Verschoyle. Sort of
thing one would expect. Here, as my wife, you'd
be free from scandal.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm a topic of scandal, am I?</said></p>

<p>He laughed derisively.</p>

<p><said>How can you escape being so--with your record?</said></p>

<p><said>And who knows what you're pleased to call my
record beyond you and George Godfree? If there's
any scandal about me it's been spread by one or the
other, possibly by both. I'm glad to learn this. If
ever anything concerning myself comes to my ears I
need not trouble to ask who are the scandal mongers.</said></p>

<p>His white face broke into pale yellow patches. His
cold eyes suddenly blazed.</p>

<p><said>I've not said a word about you, but I could. I
was not deaf to the gossip at Monte Carlo. Personally,
I don't care a hang what character you bear. What
you're doing now--mascotte to the backers of horses
as you were a mascotte to gamblers--doesn't trouble
me excepting that I want you for <emph>my</emph> mascotte. You
were once, you know, and why not again? I'll swear
<pb n="219"/>
I paid you on a much more liberal scale than either
Norman or Verschoyle may be doing now. I won't
touch this money. Put it in your pocket. It'll buy
you a few diamonds.</said></p>

<p>The insinuation was gross--it was unpardonable.
For the first time Violetta showed emotion. Her lips
quivered slightly and then became firm. Grasping
the notes he had pushed towards her, she tore them
across and across, flung the fragments contemptuously
in his face, and without a word walked out of the room.
It was as though she had slashed him with a whip.</p>

</div>



<div n="22" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XXII</head>
<head type="main">Lord Verschoyle makes the Plunge</head>

<p>Violetta's outburst of emotion did not last long. The
fresh air and the bright sun restored her nerves to
their usual tone. Before she passed through the lodge
gate of Normanhurst, she felt a sense of elation, of
triumph creep over her.</p>

<p>The cause was not far to seek. She had now a definite
reason for hating Westoby. Her instincts had not
deceived her. The man was a mercenary cad. She
could not feel sufficiently glad that she had got even
with him--that she was not under the slightest obliga-
tion. As for his base insinuations, she brushed them
aside as she would some noisome insect.</p>

<p>She returned home by train. There was no direct
railway route and the journey entailed some two miles
on foot. But excellent walker as she was, this was of
no consequence.</p>

<p>Still, what with this and the strain on her nerves
which she had gone through, she found the ascent to
the Owl's Nest somewhat fatiguing, and at the bend
<pb n="220"/>
half way up she paused to rest and take breath. While
she was standing, her hand to her side, she heard the
scrunching of the loose gravel path ahead of her and
suddenly someone came round the corner with a long
swinging stride. It was Lord Verschoyle.</p>

<p>She saw at once that his expression was unusually
sombre. It instantly changed, however, when his
glance rested upon her and he quickened his pace.</p>

<p><said>This is real luck,</said> he exclaimed gaily. <said>They
told me at your place that you were out and that it was
uncertain when you'd be back. I was plunged in
desolation. But now----</said></p>

<p>He held out his hand and retained hers, while his
keen grey eyes went rapidly over her face.</p>

<p><said>You look horribly fagged,</said> said he bluntly. <said>What
have you been doing?</said></p>

<p><said>This rough hilly road is always very trying, es-
pecially when one is tired.</said></p>

<p>Without a word he drew her hand inside his arm and
they walked slowly up the ascent. In truth she was
glad of his support, as much because of his strong
cheery presence as because of his physical help.</p>

<p>Presently he broke the silence.</p>

<p><said>You see, I've kept my word. I've called upon you.
You didn't think I would.</said></p>

<p><said>I've never thought about it.</said></p>

<p><said>No? How disappointing--to me, I mean.</said></p>

<p>And really a shadow seemed to flit across his face.</p>

<p><said>I'm sorry. But now that you're here, you're very
welcome.</said></p>

<p>There was sincerity in her tone. The contrast be-
tween Lord Verschoyle's frank, hearty manner, and
the dry, saturnine air of Dan Westoby was very re-
freshing.</p>

<p><said>I believe you mean that,</said> he rejoined, with
emphasis.</p>

<p>They reached the gate and he held it open while she
passed in.</p>

<pb n="221"/>
<p><said>You have a charming little place here,</said> said he, <said>an
ideal retreat. I took the liberty of walking round the
garden. It's tended, I can see, by someone who loves
flowers.</said></p>

<p><said>I believe everyone in my small household does.</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, but I can trace the master mind. Yours, I'll
swear.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I daresay I've something to do with it. But
you must see the inside of the house.</said></p>

<p>The sound of the clock striking the hour came through
the open French windows.</p>

<p><said>Four o'clock. Is it too early to offer you a cup of
tea?</said></p>

<p><said>I shall be delighted to accept your hospitality at
any hour of the day, but more especially now, as I can
see that tea is the one thing you want.</said></p>

<p><said>You're really an <q>understanding</q> man,</said> she said,
smilingly. <said>You'll excuse me while I look up my right
hand woman. Do please smoke meanwhile. I shan't
be long.</said></p>

<p>They had entered the pleasant low-ceilinged room
through the French windows. She hastened away,
leaving him to amuse himself as best he might.</p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle was evidently not in the mood to be
amused. He was puzzled and not a little worried. A
certain restlessness had come over him. He walked
about the room twisting his moustache and muttering
words chiefly of an ejaculatory character.</p>

<p><said>Shall I? I wonder--damned if I can make up my
mind,</said> was one of the most complete sentences which
escaped his lips.</p>

<p>Then he glanced at the mirror, straightened himself,
and did what he ought to have done at first--took
advantage of Violetta's permission and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Violetta was somewhat perturbed by
Lord Verschoyle's visit. She had had him in her mind
a good deal and was fearful lest he should think she
had not done the correct thing in keeping him in the
<pb n="222"/>
dark about the trial spin. But really, she was quite
innocent. If anybody was to blame it was Peter Gumley.</p>

<p>When she appeared, followed by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles bearing
a tray loaded with dainties, she looked brighter and
fresher, and Lord Verschoyle's eyes glinted with pleasure.
To his military mind she was the ideal woman--neat,
trim, composed yet easy in manner and with a certain
alertness of intellect which forbade the idea than she
could ever be taken unawares. With all this there was
evidence of a desire to please, a most admirable feminine
virtue.</p>

<p>The tea was served in the old-fashioned way, and
<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stubbles discreetly left them to themselves, sitting
opposite to each other. Despite her unruffled demean-
our, Violetta was conscious of a feeling of embarrassment.
She was very anxious to clear away any possible mis-
understanding, but she did not quite see her way to
approach the subject. While she was cudgelling her
brains, Lord Verschoyle suddenly said:</p>

<p><said>Do you know, Miss Vaughan, you're a most wonder-
ful woman.</said></p>

<p>Violetta opened her eyes wide at this.</p>

<p><said>In what way?</said> she asked.</p>

<p><said>In the way you can keep a secret.</said></p>

<p><said>That isn't wonderful at all. What really <emph>is</emph>
wonderful is the delusion men are under in fancying
that women cannot keep their lips closed when they
choose. But what's the secret I've kept?</said></p>

<p><said>Before I answer that question, I want to know
whether we're friends or enemies.</said></p>

<p>Just a tinge of seriousness had crept into his lordship's
voice.</p>

<p><said>Friends, of course. Why shouldn't we be?</said></p>

<p><said>Quite so. I can't imagine you otherwise. But
there's no getting away from the fact that you're up
against me over the Derby.</said></p>

<p><said>Then <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gumley has told you,</said> she cried, with
heightened colour. <said>I'm glad of that. He had no
<pb n="223"/>
business to keep you in the dark when your horse was
tried against mine. I was very angry about it.</said></p>

<p><said>You weren't to blame. Peter let me have the
whole story of your amazing power over horses--and,
may I add, over--ahem!--men also--and I again say
you're a most wonderful woman.</said></p>

<p><said>Never mind about that, Lord Verschoyle. Do
let us straighten out this business at once. I guess
Peter has told you that if Belphegor runs at the Derby
as he ran that night at Holberry Down he's bound to
win--barring accidents, of course. Quicksand hasn't
a chance. Belphegor's only rival is Killarney, and----</said></p>

<p><said>And Tom Allworth will be up, which he wasn't
the other night at Peter's,</said> put in Verschoyle.</p>

<p><said>I'm not afraid of Allworth even. Belphegor's
the finest horse I ever saw in my life, and he'll be ridden
by the only jockey who understands him. He's never
been fairly tried as he will be at the Derby.</said></p>

<p><said>Good. Now we know where we are, don't we?
Suppose we both throw our cards on the table. I
stand to win ¬£1,000 on Killarney. If he doesn't pull it
off I drop ¬£5,000 or ¬£6,000.</said></p>

<p><said>You ought to hedge. Back Belphegor.</said></p>

<p><said>Not good enough. The odds this morning are
dashed close. Killarney 5 to 2, Belphegor 3 to 1.
Had a wire from Tattersalls an hour ago. But----</said></p>

<p>His lordship's eyes twinkled.</p>

<p><said>I backed him the first thing in the morning after
the trial at 10 to 1. Peter came over the same night,
and we had a long jaw.</said></p>

<p><said>Good old Peter,</said> cried Violetta, clapping her hands.
<said>Now that was really awfully decent of the old boy.
I think I rowed him a bit for not letting you know. But
tell me--if Belphegor wins, are you safe?</said></p>

<p><said>Quite safe.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I am glad.</said></p>

<p>Violetta's increased colour had never left her. Her
eyes fairly blazed with excitement. The pleasure she
<pb n="224"/>
felt had revealed a fascinating dimple in her left cheek.
She looked supremely alluring.</p>

<p>At least, that was Lord Verschoyle's opinion.</p>

<p><said>And what about you,</said> said he, <said>if Killarney wins?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I can pay what I shall owe on Belphegor.</said></p>

<p><said>You haven't then backed my horse?</said></p>

<p><said>No. You'll forgive me, won't you? I made quite
a pile through his victory at Newmarket.</said></p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle sat silent; his brows wrinkling
the while.</p>

<p><said>By gad, Miss Vaughan,</said> he suddenly burst out,
<said>if you're not as puzzling as you are wonderful. But
that's like a woman--I mean one who's interesting.</said></p>

<p><said>Is that intended for a compliment?</said></p>

<p><said>I don't know what it's intended for. It's the
truth, anyhow. But why the deuce <emph>didn't</emph> you back
Killarney? Belphegor wasn't in your mind, was he?
Anyhow, he hadn't been run against Killarney at that
time.</said></p>

<p><said>I fancy I'm full of superstition. I wanted you to
win the Two Thousand with Killarney and so I backed
him for you.</said></p>

<p><said><emph>For</emph> me?</said> he interposed, in a bewildered tone.</p>

<p><said>Yes. You don't in the least understand, but that's
of no consequence.</said></p>

<p>How could he understand? What did he know
about her occult power of acting as a mascotte?</p>

<p><said>Then you don't care about my carrying off the
Blue Riband at Epsom?</said> said he.</p>

<p><said>Well, I'm in a difficulty. You see there's Belphegor.
I should like him to win.</said></p>

<p>It was not necessary to explain to Lord Verschoyle
that a victory of Belphegor carried with it two things--
the undoing of Dan Westoby and the re-instatement
of Norman at Normanhurst--that is, if Norman cared
to avail himself of the chance. She stood to win a
big sum with Belphegor, and she was quite prepared
to lend Norman a substantial amount. But the great
<pb n="225"/>
thing, from her point of view, was that in running
Belphegor she was acting for Norman and not for
herself. She was not prepared to argue the matter by
the light of common sense. What had common sense
to do with the occult?</p>

<p>The tea was over. They had sauntered to the window
and were looking across the garden. The season was
well advanced, and iris, lily and early roses were in
bloom. The air, thanks to the elevated position of the
Owl's Nest, was delightfully sweet and fresh and in-
vigorating. The sense of isolation had its charm.</p>

<p><said>Seems to me, Miss Vaughan, that I'm better off than
you. I shall win whichever way the Derby goes.</said></p>

<p><said>It's what I would wish.</said></p>

<p>He cast a glance at her face. It was slightly averted
and her profile alone presented itself. How firm, how
regular, it was cut, he thought. It reminded him of a
cameo.</p>

<p><said>Do you know,</said> said he, abruptly, <said>that I'm greatly
indebted to you? But for your coaxing me into putting
up Tom Allworth for the Two Thousand I should have
lost heavily. No other jockey could have snatched
victory at the post as he did. That boy's riding of
Quicksand was a marvel.</said></p>

<p><said>He rides Belphegor for the Derby,</said> rejoined Violetta,
quickly.</p>

<p><said>I congratulate you. Well, if Belphegor wins it'll
be your work anyhow.</said> Then, after a pause, and a
fidgeting twist of his moustache, he went on:</p>

<p><said>Look here, Miss Vaughan, I want to ask you a
question--will you marry me?</said></p>

<p>Violetta stared blankly at him. Surely he could
not be in earnest.</p>

<p><said>In token of your gratitude?</said> she said with a little
mocking smile.</p>

<p><said>By Jove, no. Don't treat the thing as a joke.
I never in my life was more serious. I suppose I didn't
make my proposal in the proper way. But what <emph>is</emph>
<pb n="226"/>
the proper way? If it is to surround one's declaration
with a lot of soppy sentimentality, well, then I can't
do it. But I don't believe you'd care for that kind
of thing.</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, I should hate it.</said></p>

<p>The mocking smile had fled. There was nothing of the
coy maiden in her frank, clear eyes. She spoke as she
felt and he knew it.</p>

<p><said>Exactly what I should expect,</said> he whispered
joyously. <said>I won't say that if I were eighteen instead
of thirty-eight I shouldn't have burst into some sort
of love rot--compared your eyes to stars--they're
much brighter, by the way--and so on. As it is, I
again ask, will you marry me?</said></p>

<p>She did not answer at once.</p>

<p><said>It wants thinking over--for you as well as for me,</said>
said she softly.</p>

<p><said>I grant you. I don't suggest one of the get-married-
quick war weddings. The time's gone by for that
madness. I don't ask you to decide offhand.</said></p>

<p><said>You know nothing about me, and if I marry you
or anyone you <emph>ought</emph> to know.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't see that. I take you as you are. I don't
believe, and I never did believe, in the stupid theory
that women were born to tempt and deceive. My
best friends have always been women.</said></p>

<p><said>So, then, you have a past,</said> said she, the ghost of
her mocking smile flitting across her face.</p>

<p><said>Nothing to be ashamed of, anyhow. But you won't
want to know my past any more than I want to know
yours--if you have what's called a past.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, I have, and I'd rather it came to you from
the lips of my enemies than from mine.</said></p>

<p><said>That's plucky of you. But surely you haven't
enemies?</said></p>

<p><said>Every woman who tries to go her own way is bound
to have. When she defies conventionality she's either
ridiculed or condemned. I have two enemies--you
<pb n="227"/>
saw how they recognised me at Newmarket--George
Godfree and Dan Westoby.</said></p>

<p><said><emph>Those</emph> two bounders?</said> cried his lordship, hotly.
<said>Yes, I saw the fellows, and I longed to kick one of
them--that unprincipled ruffian and blackleg, Godfree.
I've never spoken to Westoby, and I've had no dealings
with him, but I believe his reputation's none of the
best.</said></p>

<p><said>I've no doubt you're right. Anyway, I refer you
to these two for my character. What the one doesn't
know the other will supply.</said></p>

<p><said>Talk to those blackguards about <emph>you</emph>? I'm damned
--I beg your pardon--if I do. George Godfree's one
of the biggest liars and scoundrels going. I knew
him years ago. He was in my regiment and was
cashiered for cheating at cards. He married a woman
of no class. Christine Devenport she called herself--
I'll go bail her real name was Sally Spriggins or some-
thing equally low down. I hear that the precious
couple are exploiting themselves in the West end picking
up flats. They work in couples or single-handed, ac-
cording to circumstances. Few people know they're
man and wife. They're careful not to let <emph>that</emph> out.
She has half a dozen aliases, but her pet name's Mrs.
Willoughby-Smythe--a widow from Chicago. I
apologise to you for plunging you into Godfree's sordid
vicious world.</said></p>

<p><said>It has its interesting side,</said> rejoined Violetta,
thoughtfully. <said>You've told me more about <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Godfree
than I knew. How long has he been married?</said></p>

<p><said>Ten years at least. The lady's no chicken, though
she fakes herself up to look like one. But for heaven's
sake don't let us talk any more of this miserable subject.
Do get back to what's worrying me and has been for
days and days past. Are you going to think over my
question?</said></p>

<p><said>Most certainly if you'll promise to do so too. Many
<pb n="228"/>
things may happen that may cause you to change your
mind.</said></p>

<p><said>I can't imagine anything--unless you're going to
marry somebody else.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, I'm not,</said> said she, with more emphasis than
she intended.</p>

<p><said>I breathe again. Shall we leave it at that, Violetta?
I warn you it's going to be Violetta with me whatever
comes to pass. You don't mind?</said></p>

<p><said>No, I've been Violetta so long that Miss Vaughan
sounds quite strange and hatefully formal.</said></p>

<p>It was clear his lordship was satisfied with the way
his proposal was shaping. He held her hand with a
gentle, tender, pressure; he looked at her with longing
eyes. Then he abruptly said good-bye and walked
rapidly away as though he must have kissed her had
he stayed.</p>

<p>At the gate he turned and lifted his hat with a sweeping
bow that expressed confidence. Violetta waved her
hand and smiled.</p>

<p>But the smile fled as she went into the house. She had
so much to ponder over.</p>

</div>



<div n="23" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XXIII</head>
<head type="main">The Parting of the Ways</head>

<p>More food for thought was to come. Destiny had
ordained that day to be the most absorbing in Violetta's
life.</p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle's proposal had embarrassed her
terribly. She liked the man, she admired his blunt
<pb n="229"/>
honesty, she felt he was chivalrous, but granting all
this, why should she marry him? Possibly most women
past the romantic age of the teens ask themselves this
question under similar circumstances, and when they
discover a reason why they should say yes, that reason
may be wholly fanciful and ill founded. But from
some feminine <choice><corr>idiosyncrasy</corr><orig>idiosyncracy</orig></choice> it generally suffices.
Violetta, however, had not arrived at this stage. She
was troubled.</p>

<p>The sudden intrusion of Norman and his affairs,
brought about strangely enough by Lord Verschoyle,
was the source of her trouble. She had it now in her
power to set Norman free from his chains. Of course,
he ought to be told, but what would follow?</p>

<p>The truth was, she was disappointed with Norman.
She had lost the interest she once felt in him. He had
been so impassive--so irresolute. If he had really
been in love with her, she argued, he ought to have
told her so, wife or no wife. Whether she would have
encouraged him was not the point. Her attitude had
nothing to do with the matter. Anyhow, he had lost
his chance of winning her, if he ever had one, about
which she was extremely doubtful.</p>

<p>She had just come to this conclusion when Stubbles
announced a visitor--a gentleman. As usual, he had
refused to give his name.</p>

<p>Lord Verschoyle had been gone about twenty minutes.
It was hardly likely to be he. He certainly would
not have chosen to be anonymous. But it might be
Dan Westoby.</p>

<p>Not on any account would she admit Westoby into
the house, and she went into the hall with the light of
battle in her eyes.</p>

<p>She stopped, transfixed with astonishment. The
visitor was Sir John Norman.</p>

<p>He came forward with an air which was distinctly
apologetic. Violetta instantly recovered herself and
advanced to meet him. They shook hands, and for a
<pb n="230"/>
few moments not a word passed. Violetta was the
first to speak.</p>

<p><said>This is a surprise, Sir John,</said> said she, anxious to
end the embarrassment.</p>

<p><said>I ought to have written. It isn't fair to take you
unawares,</said> he stammered.</p>

<p><said>You haven't done that. I'm very glad to see you.</said></p>

<p><said>Really? I don't know what you must think of my
silence. But I had good reasons. I've gone through
a great deal of worry and anxiety.</said></p>

<p><said>I hope that's all passed away.</said></p>

<p><said>No, unfortunately.</said></p>

<p>By this time they were in the sitting-room. Norman
was ill at ease and Violetta pointed to a chair. He sat
down wearily. His first words were totally unexpected:</p>

<p><said>That was Lord Verschoyle whom I passed in the
lane leading to your road, wasn't it?</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, do you know him?</said></p>

<p><said>Only by sight. He may know me, but I can't say.
At all events, he didn't see me. He seemed in very good
spirits.</said></p>

<p><said>Did he?</said></p>

<p>Their talk appeared destined to be carried on in jerks.</p>

<p><said>I'd like to explain why I haven't written to you.
I hope you've been comfortable here?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, yes, I feel quite at home.</said></p>

<p>He was so absorbed in his own thoughts he hardly
heard her.</p>

<p><said>I needn't tell you,</said> he went on, <said>that my worry
was about Christine, my wife you know. I've been
seeking to commence proceedings for a divorce. There's
ample cause, but the exposure would be so terrible that I
hesitated. Yet things can't go on as they are, and I
must take some decided step. I think I should have
written or called upon you but for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlowe's opinion
that it would not be prudent.</said></p>

<p><said>You mean that disagreeable things were likely to
be said?</said></p>

<pb n="231"/>
<p><said>Yes,</said> he rejoined, evidently relieved at her calm-
ness. <said>And they <emph>were</emph> said and by Ella. She amazed
me by her base insinuations. We had a violent quarrel,
over you, and I left the house next morning. I haven't
seen or heard from her since.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm very sorry I should be the cause of your es-
trangement.</said></p>

<p><said>It's really turned out for the best. She's going to
marry the vicar, and the necessity of doing something
for myself forced me to look up some of my friends--
Government johnnies, you know--the permanent
officials who stick to their posts like leeches and don't
go out like their ornamental heads with every general
election. I've been landed very comfortably, but the
drawback is that I must drop the divorce business.
The scandal would smash me up. The chief of my
department wouldn't stand it, you know.</said></p>

<p><said>I don't suppose he would. Well, I think I can
get you out of your difficulty. Your enquiries I guess,
haven't led you to the discovery that the woman with
whom you went through the marriage ceremony was at
the time the wife of your friend George Godfree.</said></p>

<p><said>What! Good Heavens, how did you learn that?</said>
Norman cried, agitatedly.</p>

<p><said>It doesn't matter. All I can say is that my in-
formant isn't likely to make a mistake or say that
which isn't true. You've only got to get data to go upon
and Somerset House will do the rest.</said></p>

<p>Norman made no reply. He was quite unnerved.
He sat mopping his damp brow and staring helplessly
at Violetta.</p>

<p><said>So I'm free, and thanks to you,</said> at last he muttered
brokenly.</p>

<p><said>No thanks to me. It was quite by accident I
learned the news. All the same, I congratulate you.</said></p>

<p>With a violent effort he pulled himself together and
speaking fairly calmly, said:</p>

<p><said>It's only right you should know what I've been told
<pb n="232"/>
about you. It's nothing to your discredit, but it's
worried me a good deal, and I should have said the
story was a lie if it hadn't come from two sources--
both tainted, I may say. Mind you, it's no business
of mine, and I've no right to utter a word to you on the
subject--it's solely that I may ease my mind by hearing
you deny what's being said.</said></p>

<p>Violetta suspected what was coming, but she would not
assist him. In her opinion, he had either deteriorated
or some change had come over herself. Somehow, she
no longer felt sympathetic towards him.</p>

<p><said>Well,</said> said she, simply.</p>

<p><said>It's said you're continually on the race course--
that you bet--that you're friendly with the men who
are my aversion--bookmakers. You know I owe my
ruin to one--Dan Westoby by name.</said></p>

<p><said>I'm not likely to forget. What you've heard about
my going to races, betting, and all the rest of it, is
perfectly true. I even own a race horse, but that's a
secret. Keep it to yourself, please.</said></p>

<p>He was staggered. He stared at her amazed,
confused.</p>

<p><said>I--I am sorry,</said> he stammered. <said>The associations,
the surroundings of the turf are to me so repulsive
that--that----</said></p>


<p><said>Of course they are. They <emph>must</emph> be. You were
unlucky. Do you recollect once forbidding me to talk
about horses and racing? It's I, now, who forbid
your mentioning the subject. It isn't worth while,
is it?</said></p>

<p><said>Oh, you're right--you always were. No doubt
I'm prejudiced. You see, I had such a beastly ex-
perience and of course I was a fool. But----</said> he
looked at her yearningly. She had spoken so kindly;
she hadn't shown the slightest rancour at his pre-
sumptuous criticism. She was more than ever adorable.</p>

<p><said>Confound it, Violetta,</said> he burst out, <said>now that I
can say what's in my heart, why should I keep it back?
<pb n="233"/>
I love you--I've always loved you from the day when
I first saw you at Normanhurst. Things then were
impossible, of course, but by Heaven--if I had only run
across you when--when I was free----</said></p>

<p><said>Don't make me laugh,</said> she gently interposed.
<said>What you're saying isn't very flattering, you know.
I can't help thinking you were at that time ready to
marry anybody. Your Christine amply satisfied
you.</said></p>

<p>Norman bit his lip and coloured deeply. He stood
rebuked, and he knew he deserved her sarcasm. He
knew also that a declaration of love would not meet
with much success--at all events, while Violetta was
in her present mood.</p>

<p>But some impulse, some temptation led him on.</p>

<p><said>Oh, I admit I was an ass--an egregious ass. And
being so, I suppose I'm not good enough for you. But
I should worship you, all the same.</said></p>

<p><said>Thanks. I don't want any man's worship. That
kind of thing's a delusion.</said></p>

<p><said>It may be so, but that's how I feel. Just to con-
vince you that I've a grain of practical common sense,
may I say that my pay is quite substantial--much more
than I'm worth I'll swear--that Barlowe tells me the
landed property he saved from the wreck is rapidly
increasing in value, and that he's in hopes of proving
that Westoby cheated me over Normanhurst.</said></p>

<p><said>I congratulate you.</said></p>

<p><said>All this means a lot to me. It means my hopes,</said>
went on Norman hurriedly, <said>and now that I know
from your lips that I'm no longer shackled, the cherished
wish of my heart----</said></p>

<p><said>I can understand how landed property has gone up,</said>
interposed Violetta, remorselessly cutting him short--
she was not in the mood for Norman's sentimental
vein--<said>I always said the rent of the Owl's Nest was
far too low. I'm quite prepared to pay more.</said></p>

<p><said>Violetta!</said> he exclaimed, reproachfully.</p>

<pb n="234"/>
<p><said>I'm speaking in your own interest. You really
ought to be more business-like.</said></p>

<p><said>What has business to do with love? I want you
for my wife, Violetta. I've always wanted you----</said></p>

<p><said>Yes, you said as much just now, but it's of no use.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my answer is no, and
always will be.</said></p>

<p>She did not wish to be harsh in her tone and manner,
but she could not help it. He irritated her at that
moment.</p>

<p>His face fell. He looked utterly miserable.</p>

<p><said>We've been exceedingly good friends,</said> went on
Violetta, quickly, lest there should be an embarrassing
pause, <said>and I should like our friendship to continue,
but there'd be an end to it if you imagined I should
alter my mind. Take my advice and lose no time
in verifying what I told you about--your Christine.</said></p>

<p><said>Of course. I--I can see that I've been premature.
I ought to have made sure where I was before I said
what I did just now.</said></p>

<p><said>It would have made no difference. Pray don't
mistake me.</said></p>

<p>She was becoming distressed. She wanted him to go.
Why couldn't he see that? She had had the day of
her life. Three proposals of marriage within some
ten hours! What woman could go through such a
strain and not show it?</p>

<p><said>Very well. I obey. Good-bye.</said></p>

<p>He held out his hand and she took it. Her turmoil
of mind was evident in her face. Her expression was
softer than Norman had ever seen it. It was tender.
It had something in it indefinitely appealing. In an
instant he was tempted to recur to the tabooed subject.
Naturally, he imagined her unusual emotion was due
to his influence, whereas all she wished was to get rid of
him.</p>

<p>He raised her hand to his lips and she was alone.
Truly, Violetta might have said that no act in his life
<pb n="235"/>
became John Norman so well as his departure out of
hers!</p>

</div>



<div n="24" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XXIV</head>
<head type="main">Violetta's Trying Day</head>

<p>Of her three offers of marriage, Violetta thought most
about Dan Westoby's. It oppressed her. It filled her
with apprehension. But it also stimulated her to be
on the alert. She felt that Westoby was not a man to
take a defeat lying down.</p>

<p>She was right. She had not left him five minutes
before he sent a wire to Godfree, and then, locking the
door, gathered up the torn Treasury notes with the
intention of piecing the fragments together at some
time or another. If Violetta was fool enough to throw
away ¬£250 he was not, and especially at that time.</p>

<p>Godfree arrived post haste. He had some news
about Violetta which he had kept in reserve until a
fitting moment came for making money out of it. That
moment had now arrived. He and Westoby lunched
together and Godfree, after hearing what the bookmaker
had to say, told him the important piece of news--for a
consideration. The news was that the owner of Bel-
phegor was Violetta Vaughan.</p>

<p>A sickly grin spread itself over Westoby's face. He
rarely laughed audibly. He chuckled sometimes, but
more often a noiseless grin sufficed, as it did now. After
a long consultation Godfree received his instructions
and returned to town with money in his pocket. All
that evening the Honourable George prowled about
Leicester Square, Coventry Street, Piccadilly Circus,
and the Piccadilly end of Regent Street, occasionally
making brief excursions into Shaftesbury Avenue. He
<pb n="236"/>
specially favoured the outside of restaurants and taverns.</p>

<p>At last he found the man he was seeking--a miserable
looking creature, seedily dressed, blotchy faced, dull
eyed--Alf Richards.</p>

<p><said>Hullo, Alf,</said> said Godfree, thickly (while hovering
about the exteriors of the various hostelries he had not
forgotten the interiors), <said>what are you up to?</said></p>

<p><said>Same old game, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Godfree--stony broke. It's a
toss up between the workhouse and Father Thames.</said></p>

<p><said>While you're making up your mind come and have
a <soCalled>livener.</soCalled> There's just time.</said></p>

<p>It was ten minutes to ten. A public house was handy,
and George ran his man into the saloon bar and elbowed his
way through a jostling, noisy crowd clamouring for their
last drink. Godfree was well-known to the girls behind
the counter, and was soon served--two double brandies.
Alf swallowed his at two gulps. His eyes glistened.
He looked at Godfree expectantly. He knew the Hon-
ourable George was not one to fling his money over so
wretched an object as himself without wanting something
in return.</p>

<p><said>Look here, Alf,</said> whispered Godfree. <said>I can put
you on to a good job, but we can't jaw about it here.
Come along to the Caf√© Astrachan.</said></p>

<p>Amid the raucous yells of <q>Time, gents, please,</q>
the two men edged themselves out. The Caf√© Astrachan
was not five minutes walk away, and the clock was on
the stroke of ten when they reached the grimy uninviting
establishment which might have been a third class
<foreign xml:lang="fr">estaminet</foreign> of Montremart in its suggestiveness of dirt
and sottish dissipation.</p>

<p>The inside favoured the resemblance. It was a long,
narrow shop with bare walls and no attempt at decora-
tion beyond a couple of faded woollen rugs hanging
from two of the panels, with what object only the
proprietor knew. To the ordinary person they were
of neither use nor ornament. The air was hot, f≈ìtid,
stuffy with the fumes of rank tobacco. Obvious second-
<pb n="237"/>
hand marble-topped tables and uncomfortable cheap
non-upholstered chairs were ranged in two rows with a
centre gangway. There were no such luxuries as velvet
benches; if the floor was covered with oilcloth, the
pattern was indistinguishable through wear and dirt.</p>

<p>The place was about three parts full with a nondescript
crowd, mostly dark visaged, unkempt haired and shabbily
dressed. Clean collars and cuffs were apparently un-
known. Foreign nationalities prevailed, but by a
quarter past ten the scourings of the neighbouring
restaurants would swarm in and tax the energies of the
active, business like waitresses to the uttermost.</p>

<p>The Astrachan was of the type of caf√© which made
you feel depressed and degraded directly you entered
it. Some of the giggling noisy girls in tawdry dresses
and hats, at which a wardrobe dealer would have turned
up her nose, might have looked decent in other sur-
roundings, but here they suggested the Parisian <foreign xml:lang="fr">apache</foreign>
though for the most part they were English. Their
male companions, who paid in lamb-like fashion for
anything the girls wanted, and had probably been doing
so elsewhere all the evening, had no characteristics
beyond extreme foolishness. They were probably under
the impression they were seeing <soCalled>life.</soCalled></p>

<p>Somehow the unhealthy pallor of some of these young
fools, their leaden eyes, their subdued voices, the painted
cheeks, the blackened eyebrows, the excessively red
lips, and the hysterical laughter of the women--most
of them hardly out of their teens--brought to mind
the sinister suggestion of cocaine, veronal and goodness
knows what other modern nerve poisons.</p>

<p>Godfree and Richards took two vacant seats against
the wall and were soon discussing the <soCalled>job.</soCalled> It had
to do with the profession into which Alf Richards
proposed entering years and years before--doctoring
and drugs. The din was so deafening and incessant
when the late comers packed the place that the two
men could talk freely without the necessity of whispering
<pb n="238"/>
save at times when the <choice><corr>kernel</corr><orig>kernal</orig></choice> of the matter was ap-
proached.</p>

<p>Alf was clearly averse from undertaking Godfree's
commission. Godfree got quite angry at the man's
obstinacy, and when Godfree was angry and half drunk
he was not very choice in his language.</p>

<p><said>Don't be a damned ass,</said> he growled. <said>You can't
afford it. You'll <emph>have</emph> to do what I want. You'd be
in an infernal fix if I were to drop a line to the police
about--well, you can finish the rest for yourself.</said></p>

<p>The haggard face of Alf Richards was convulsed with
terror. He knew well to what Godfree alluded. Deep
down in the secret life of all great cities exists a mode
of income open to any man or woman with (or without)
a little surgical skill. From time to time the news-
papers reveal the secret. Richards when in desperate
straits had made use of his hospital studies in this
way, and though he had hitherto escaped the law,
Nemesis was always hanging over him.</p>

<p><said>All that's past and forgotten,</said> he mumbled.
<said>What holds me back is that I hate going against Miss
Vaughan. She's been a good friend to me and----</said></p>

<p><said>Bah, shut up. Don't be maudlin. Violetta
Vaughan's not worth thinking twice about. She's
no better and no worse than others of her class who sell
themselves and live to fleece men. She's an unscrupu-
lous Circe and worse. <emph>I</emph> know.</said></p>

<p><said>What do you know?</said> suddenly came the words
from across the table.</p>

<p>Godfree raised his eyes. He recognised Lord
Verschoyle sitting opposite.</p>

<p><said>This is a private conversation,</said> returned Godfree,
with an insolent stare. <said>You've no right to interfere.</said></p>

<p><said>I've every right when you speak insultingly of a
lady with whom I am acquainted, in a voice loud enough
for me and others to hear.</said></p>

<p><said>If you hadn't been listening you wouldn't have
heard.</said></p>

<pb n="239"/>
<p><said>You're a liar and a blackguard. I don't want to
make a disturbance in this place. I ask you to come
outside.</said></p>

<p><said>And I ask you to mind your own business.</said></p>

<p>Verschoyle's reply was short and sharp. His fist
shot out and landed full on Godfree's nose.</p>

<p><said>That's my business,</said> he exclaimed. <said>If you're
a man, now come out.</said></p>

<p>Instantly the place was in a tumult. Men sprang
to their feet, those far from the scene mounted the
chairs, the waitresses fled, women screamed, the agitated
proprietor crying out something in a foreign tongue
vainly tried to force a path through the crowded gang-
way.</p>

<p>In his younger days Godfree had been a bit of a
bruiser, but he had long since lost his alertness and
activity. He retaliated but his blow missed. Before
the conflict could be renewed, some of the men restrained
the combatants, and the agonised proprietor having
by this time edged his way to the table, begged them
to go out. He did not want to send for the police.</p>

<p>Godfree was blinded by passion. When he thought
of Violetta and of his continual rebuffs at her hands,
the recollection always enraged him, and this galling
recollection was in his mind as he uttered his foul
aspersions. Physically, however, he was no coward.
He sullenly rose and went towards the door. Verschoyle
had already moved thither and was awaiting him.</p>

<p>Soon they were outside. Verschoyle had his old
chum, Sir Frederick Dartnell with him. The two
had strolled into the Caf√© Astrachan purely out of
curiosity. This curiosity had been soon satisfied,
and they were about to leave when Godfree's words
reached their ears.</p>

<p>A fairly wide court was but two or three yards away.
Godfree knew it well. Said he in a grating, sneering
voice when they were at the corner of the court:</p>

<p><said>You took a mean advantage of me inside the caf√©.
<pb n="240"/>
You knew we couldn't fight there. It won't be the
same thing here.</said></p>

<p>He jerked his head towards the opening of the court
and turned into it. Verschoyle followed, despite the
whispered remonstrances of Dartnell, to whom a fracas
of a low type did not appeal. Verschoyle took not
the slightest notice of his friend's words. He simply
handed him his hat.</p>

<p>There was no preliminary squaring or feinting. The
two went at it tooth and nail. They were about the
same age and build, but whereas Verschoyle was in
the very pink of condition, Godfree was quite off colour.
Almost the first blow settled him. He fell heavily
and remained on the ground like a log.</p>

<p>Verschoyle turned to Richards, who was looking on
dismayed.</p>

<p><said>See to your friend. I've done with him.</said></p>

<p>Richards sided up, but instead of taking notice of
Godfree he whispered hoarsely to Lord Verschoyle:</p>

<p><said>Thank you, sir, for what you did. George Godfree
deserved all he got and more. It was all lies, every
word--about Miss Vaughan. She's as straight a woman
as ever breathed. By God, there's few who would have
come unscathed out of the beastly crowd she was in
some four or five years ago as she did.</said></p>

<p><said>What do you know about her? Who the deuce
are you?</said></p>

<p><said>I'm no good to anybody, so what does it matter who
I am? I'll only say this, that if Violetta Vaughan's
your friend you've got a real good pal.</said></p>

<p><said>I believe you. But tell me. What did you mean
by that <q>beastly crowd?</q></said></p>

<p><said>The Beak Street Club crew. It was this way.</said></p>

<p>In a few words Alf Richards gave a summary of his
recollections of Captain Vaughan's venture, to which
Verschoyle listened with intense interest. Alf did
not forget to enlarge on Violetta's many good points.</p>

<pb n="241"/>
<p><said>Thanks. Now about Westoby. What has he to
do with Miss Vaughan?</said></p>

<p><said>I don't know. Westoby doesn't often open his
mouth. But you'd better get. Godfree's moving. I
don't want him to see me talking to you. He's dan-
gerous.</said></p>

<p><said>Is he? Well, you've done me a good turn and
we'll dry up. You don't look over flourishing. This
may be of use to you.</said></p>

<p>He thrust a treasury note into Alf's hand and strode
away with Dartnell.</p>

<p><said>What the devil's the answer to this riddle?</said>
asked the latter. <said>You're about the last one to get
into a street brawl. I'm not curious, but, hang it, I'd
like to know. Who's Violetta Vaughan?</said></p>

<p><said>The woman I mean to marry--if she'll have me.</said></p>

</div>




<div n="25" type="chapter">
<head type="num">Chapter XXV</head>
<head type="main">Dan Westoby's Last Coup</head>

<p>Peter Gumley warned by Violetta, took extra pre-
cautions to guard the <soCalled>cracks.</soCalled> She also made a
proposition to him to which he was strongly opposed
but she was so insistent that at last he <choice><corr>reluctantly</corr><orig>reluctlantly</orig></choice>
gave way.</p>

<p>Gumley had no fear of any attempt at foul play being
successful, but he had not reckoned upon Parsons, his
discharged groom. At one corner of the Holberry
Down property was a little patch of low-lying woodland
always swampy even in the time of drought. Beneath
the patches of weeds and water lay a mass of glutinous
mud and slime not much less than a foot deep. On
the shelving bank nearest the dry level ground amid
<pb n="242"/>
the undergrowth was a fence of barbed wire. No
watchers patrolled this spot, as Parsons well knew.</p>

<p>On the further side of the wood was barren common
land, on which many years before a squatter had built
a hut. Before he had remained long enough to establish
his claim he was ejected but the hut was left to decay
at its leisure. Not far from the hut was a post some
ten feet high, with a fragment of a cross-piece hanging
loose, black with age and in places greenish with some
kind of fungus. It was all that was left of the gallows
where a century and a half ago and more, many a
criminal had passed his last moments.</p>

<p>After nightfall few people cared to cross the common,
and its solitude made the hut a very convenient place
for Godfree and Parsons to meet and arrange their
plans. The coup was to be brought off on the eve
of the Derby, run very late that year.</p>

<p>Parsons was not seen that night at the Barley Mow.
He had taken up his quarters at the hut, and with his
pipe and a flask of whisky for his companions, awaited
the coming of Godfree and Richards. The latter,
terrorised by Godfree's threats had surrendered himself
completely.</p>

<p>The hours crept slowly on. The time appointed
for the meeting was midnight. Every now and again
Parsons ventured from the hut, and looked anxiously
at the sky. His fear was lest there should be a moon,
but there did not seem to be much cause for appre-
hension on that score. The night was as dark as the
most enthusiastic burglar could wish.</p>

<p>A little after midnight he heard the steps which he
expected. The door opened, and Godfree appeared.
He was dressed in a close-fitting suit, and with a travelling
cap with the lapels pulled down over his ears. It may
have been that the night was chilly, or that he wanted
to disguise himself slightly. If the latter, the cap
answered the purpose fairly well.</p>

<p><said>Well,</said> said he, <said>are you ready?</said></p>

<pb n="243"/>
<p><said>Yes.</said></p>

<p><said>Then we'll start. There's no hurry, so we'll take
it leisurely. I reckon one o'clock's a good time, eh?
What do you think?</said></p>

<p><said>It ought to be. Ten o'clock's about the hour
everybody goes to bed.</said></p>

<p>They quitted the hut and tramped their way through
the bracken, which was now fairly high, towards the
gallows post. In the darkness a few yards away a man
was standing motionless, bis head bent, his hands
thrust in the side pockets of his overcoat. A slight
mist had arisen within a very few minutes and the
man's outline was so vague he might have been simply
a shadow.</p>

<p>Godfree went up to him and gripped his arm savagely.</p>

<p><said>What are you mooning over, you ass,</said> he whispered.
<said>Pull yourself together. If you're going to funk the
business give the stuff to me. But don't suppose, Alf,
you're out of it because I take on the job. I guess I
needn't remind you that I know <emph>something</emph> which might
lead you to the neighbourhood of the gallows. You're
close to it now, by the way. Get me?</said></p>

<p>Alf Richards turned his face--ghastly grey it looked
in the gloom--towards the horrible memento of the
past.</p>

<p><said>I get you right enough, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Godfree. You're the
sort of man who'd chuck anyone--your best friend if
need be--when they're no longer any use to you.</said></p>

<p><said>Shut up. Are you going to back out? That's what
I want to know?</said></p>

<p><said>No. I'm up to the neck in this black business and
I'll have to go through with it.</said></p>

<p><said>I reckon you will,</said> muttered Godfree.</p>

<p>Ever since the night of his humiliation at the hands
of Lord Verschoyle, Godfree had never relaxed his
hold on Alf Richards. He had kept him continually
in a state of semi-intoxication.</p>

<p>They tramped on to the wood, Richards walking
<pb n="244"/>
between his two companions, who had their hands
beneath his arms and forced him to go their pace.
Soon they were on the brink of the treacherous spot.
For nights past Parsons had been making preparations
for crossing. He had collected a number of boulders
and had sunk them at convenient intervals to form
stepping stones. Risky as was the showing of a light,
he flashed his electric torch and showed the tops of the
stones peeping above the water.</p>

<p><said>This fool'll never keep his footing,</said> growled Godfree.
<said>You'll have to carry him on your back, Parsons.</said></p>

<p><said>Not me, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Godfree. I'd rather leave him here
and call for him as we come back. What's the good
of him as he is? Pretty nigh <emph>non compost</emph>, I should
say.</said></p>

<p>Godfree admitted this. Hitherto he had not dared
to trust Alf Richards out of his sight, but in his present
half-helpless and wholly stupid condition he couldn't
do much harm. Certainly just now he was a nuisance
and a hindrance.</p>

<p><said>Give him a drop of his own dope an' he'll be safe
enough,</said> suggested Parsons facetiously.</p>

<p><said>Don't talk rot. Let us go on and see what happens.</said></p>

<p>This was very soon settled. Richards promptly
collapsed.</p>

<p><said>That does it,</said> said Parsons. <said>He'll have to stay
where he is. Has he got the stuff on him?</said></p>

<p><said>Of course he has. I wanted him to do the job. He
knows the ropes, but we'll have to carry on by our-
selves.</said></p>

<p>Godfree thrust his hand into the pocket of the pros-
trate man's overcoat and took out a cardboard box
and a phial. Richards seemed indifferent to or un-
conscious of what was being done.</p>

<p>Presently Godfree and Parsons attempted the tricky
crossing and got over safely. They scrambled up the
bank, cutting the lower strands of the barbed wire
fence on their way, and Parsons made for a sort of gully
<pb n="245"/>
at the bottom of which trickled a thin stream. This
they crept along and were well concealed.</p>

<p>The gully led to the wall of the stable yard, and at the
bottom of the wall was a circular opening to allow the
passage of the water. The latter continued its course
inside and had an outlet at the wall on the other side
of the yard. People often wanted to know the good
of this little open ditch with its surface drainage water.
They were told that if the water were prevented from
coming into the stable yard the soil which was clay
would dry and shrink, and the solid stable buildings
would be unsafe.</p>

<p>Parsons, who was familiar with every nook and
cranny of the Holberry Down stables, saw how the gully
and the circular opening in the wall could be made
use of. The opening was large enough for even a man
as big as Godfree to creep through.</p>

<p>It was done. Parsons went first, and soon the two
were crouching in the darkness.</p>

<p><said>Which is the door of Belphegor's stable?</said>
whispered Godfree.</p>

<p><said>Keep close to me an' I'll take you straight to it.
He's in a stable all to himself. I told you so. Makes
things easy, don't it?</said></p>

<p><said>What about the dog?</said></p>

<p><said>Kennel's right over t'other side of the yard. He
won't bother us if you don't make no noise.</said></p>

<p>Presently he and Godfree were opposite the door.
Parsons had a duplicate key which he had had made to
further his depredations on the corn bin when he was
in Peter's employ. It was well oiled and moved noise-
lessly in the lock. They crept inside unseen, favoured
by the darkness and mist.</p>

<p>Parsons, of course, knew the situation of Belphegor's
stall, and crept towards it. He could discern a vague
outline of a figure on a bundle of hay at the entrance.
Godfree saw it too.</p>

<p><said>Make for the boy--quick,</said> he breathed.</p>

<pb n="246"/>
<p>The contemplated surprise attack might have been
brought off but for Belphegor who suddenly elected
to be restive. The recumbent form on the hay sprang
into life. The light of an electric torch flashed into
the two men's faces.</p>

<p><said>You vil----</said></p>

<p>The word was never completed. Parsons had clutched
the speaker's throat, while Godfree whipped open the
cardboard box. In a second a sponge saturated with
chloroform was pressing over nose and mouth. It was
dark once more for in the scuffle the electric torch had
been dropped among the hay.</p>

<p>All seemed to be going well, but again Belphegor's
temper asserted itself. Whatever was the cause, he
lashed out a hoof and caught Godfree a nasty kick on
the shoulder.</p>

<p><said>Curse the brute,</said> he muttered, together with a few
other epithets.</p>

<p><said>Been worse if he'd kicked your leg,</said> whispered
Parsons. <said>Where's the dope? Stick the bottle to
the boy's lips. A drop or two follerin' that chloryform
ought to do the trick.</said></p>

<p>Godfree's right arm was useless. Parsons had to
administer the dose.</p>

<p><said>It'll be all a job to physic that beast. <emph>I</emph> know him
too well. I'd rather put a bullet through his brains.
'Spose I fetch him a crack over the hocks. That ought
to spoil his running, I guess.</said></p>

<p>A long handled brush was on its nail close to the stall,
just as it used to hang in Parson's time. He snatched
at it, at the same moment Godfree gripped his arm.</p>

<p><said>Leave it alone, you damned fool. I don't want to
hurt the horse.</said></p>

<p><said>What! Warn't there to be any hocussing?</said></p>

<p><said>No, not of the horse--the boy. Both I and Dan
Westoby mean to let the horse run and do his best
or worst--most likely his worst.</said></p>

<p><said>What did you bring me here for, then?</said></p>

<pb n="247"/>
<p><said>You've been well paid. Why are you grumbling?
Look here, you blockhead. No one knows better than
you that there's only one jockey who can ride Belphegor.
Can't you see that if we knock out young Tim Hollis
Belphegor hasn't a dog's chance of winning, no matter
who's up? Won't that rile its owner more than any-
thing? Hocussing the brute with Hollis on his back
wouldn't do it half as much. What about <emph>that</emph>?</said></p>

<p>He pointed to the inanimate form on the hay.</p>

<p><said>Miss Vaughan may scratch him,</said> said Parsons,
gloomily.</p>

<p><said>Not she. I'll give the devil his due. She's too good
a sport. Now then, let's clear out.</said></p>

<p>They crept back the way they came. They crossed
the stepping stones; they stumbled upon Alf Richards.
He was lying exactly in the position in which he was left.</p>

<p><said>I don't like this,</said> muttered Godfree, uneasily.</p>

<p>He knelt down, felt the man's pulse, then his heart.
He glanced at the ashen face. The eyes were staring.
The lips were partly open. A little blood and froth
marked them.</p>

<p><said>My God, Parsons, the fellow's dead!</said></p>

<p>The two men looked at each other. It was a
catastrophe totally unlooked for. Anyhow, they were
not responsible for his death. And, being dead, he
could say nothing. <choice><corr>From</corr><orig>Fom</orig></choice> this point of view the event
was all to the good.</p>

<p><said>Let's leave him as he is,</said> said Parsons in a low voice.
<said>It may be a week or more afore anybody'll find him.</said></p>

<p><said>That's so.</said></p>

<p>Parsons had already turned away, and Godfree was
about to follow when an idea suddenly struck him. He
took the cardboard box and the phial of <soCalled>dope</soCalled> and
thrust them into Richard's pocket.</p>

<p><said aloud="false">That'll explain everything,</said> he thought.</p>

<p>Then he hurried off.</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p><said>Mary, I feel very worried about Belphegor. I
<pb n="248"/>
oughtn't to have agreed,</said> said Peter Gumley, rubbing
his chin with an air of uneasiness.</p>

<p><said>I told you so, Peter. You shouldn't have said
yes to such a wild harum scarum idea.</said></p>

<p><said>Well, it's done. Anyhow, there's been no signal and
I had the 'phone set up in case anything went wrong.
I wasn't to go unless I heard.</said></p>

<p><said>That's nothing to do with it. It's pretty nigh
one o'clock in the morning! Go and see if it's all right.</said></p>

<p>As Peter generally obeyed his wife, he went.</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>Three o'clock in the afternoon of the next day. Within
ten minutes or so the great race for the Derby stakes
would be decided.</p>

<p>The Derby Day has been described a thousand and
one times more or less. It would be but a tedious
repetition to attempt to do so again. Interest for
the present purpose is centred around two men, Dan
Westoby and George Godfree. The latter had his
right arm in a sling. They were anxiously awaiting
the horses.</p>

<p>At last the string entered the course and cantered
leisurely to the starting post. Westoby had stationed
himself sufficiently near to note every horse and every
jockey with the naked eye, but for all that he used
his field glasses.</p>

<p><said>What the devil's the meaning of this?</said> demanded
Westoby sharply. <said>Tim Hollis is up on Belphegor.</said></p>

<p><said>Rats! The boy won't be fit to ride for a week.
I left him last night lying insensible. I--by God, I
believe you're right. It <emph>is</emph> the urchin.</said></p>

<p>Most certainly it was, and as spry and as healthy
looking as he could possibly be.</p>

<p><said>You've sold me, you sneak,</said> burst out Westoby.</p>

<p><said>Sneak yourself. I risked everything for you, and
nearly got killed in the bargain. Parsons must have
been hoodwinked. He swore that Hollis would be with
the horse all right. We doped some other stable lad.</said></p>

<pb n="249"/>
<p><said>That's a lie. Peter wouldn't be such an ass.
Belphegor's not to be trusted with a stranger.</said></p>

<p>He could say no more. The horses were being mar-
shalled. They were off. They started in a cluster, the
jockey's caps and jackets mingling in a confused mass
of colour. In half a minute no particular horse seemed
prominent; then a blue and orange darted ahead.
It was Killarney, the favourite. Tom Allworth had
shaken his mount free from the ruck and Killarney
was rushing for dear life close to the rails.</p>

<p><said>Damn! I shall pull it off after all,</said> muttered
Westoby. <said>Good horse!--great horse!</said></p>

<p>But at Tattenham Corner other horses were creeping
up. Foremost was a scarlet and black.</p>

<p><said aloud="false">Rouge et Noir! <emph>Her</emph> colours. Curse the woman.
She hasn't forgotten her luck.</said></p>

<p>The thought was Westoby's. It was an omen of
evil for him. Violetta was not now his mascotte!</p>

<p>Yard by yard, foot by foot Belphegor overhauled
Killarney, which was visibly tiring. Allworth called
upon him for another effort, but the pace was too good.
Amid an uproar almost unparalleled, Belphegor passed
the post half a length in front of the favourite.</p>

<p>Westoby dropped his field glasses into their case with
a bang. He turned to Godfree, his face white as a
sheet, but quite cool in his manner.</p>

<p><said>This lets me down to zero. I don't know whether
I've to thank you or Parsons, or the boy, or--the
woman.</said></p>

<p><said>Where are you off to?</said> whispered Godfree,
anxiously, as Westoby was striding away.</p>

<p><said>Don't know. To the devil, most likely.</said></p>

<p>He and Godfree, who was sticking to him, had hardly
got out of the crowd when a police inspector with a
couple of men who, despite their plain clothes, had
detective written all over them, approached.</p>

<p><said>You are <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dan Westoby, I think.</said></p>

<p><said>Well?</said></p>

<pb n="250"/>
<p><said>And your friend's name, I believe, is George
Godfree.</said></p>

<p><said>What do you want? Out with it,</said> said Westoby,
brusquely.</p>

<p><said>I hold a warrant to arrest both you gentlemen on a
charge of conspiracy.</said></p>

<p><said>Confoundedly vague. Conspiring to do what?</said></p>

<p><said>To do bodily injury by administering a noxious drug
to one Violetta Vaughan,</said> returned the inspector,
reading from the document in his hand.</p>

<p><said>By God, she's done us!</said> burst out Godfree,
furiously.</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>It was so. Violetta's plan was to dress herself in
Tim's clothes and take his place by the side of Belphegor.
She was dozing when Godfree and Parsons took her by
surprise. But she recognised Godfree and she had not
quite succumbed to the effects of the chloroform when
Belphegor shot out his hoof. Had Godfree tried to
shift the blame on to Alf Richards, his injured shoulder
would have given him the lie. But there was no
necessity. Parsons, to save his own skin as much as
possible, gave his employers away.</p>

<p>Violetta, unconscious, was of course discovered by
Peter Gumley, and a doctor was instantly summoned.
The quantity of the dope she had swallowed was for-
tunately very small, and she speedily recovered.</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>The last scene. (<emph>Enter Violetta and Lord Verschoyle</emph>).</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Violetta</speaker>
<p>Now that I've told you all my
past, you may want more time
to think over the matter. In
marrying me you're marrying a
great risk, you know.</p>
</sp>

<pb n="251"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Verschoyle</speaker>
<p>I don't care what risk I run
to get you, Violetta, and I'll not
take a second for thought. A
woman who can care for a horse
as you do can care still more for
a man. Dearest, you're <emph>my</emph>
mascotte--for life!</p>
